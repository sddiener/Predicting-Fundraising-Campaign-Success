<p><strong>Fortunate People</strong> started 3 years ago with an aim to share inspirational content related to Bhakti yoga and the Vedas. Our Facebook page now serves over 15K subscribers with daily <i>wisdom</i>, hope-giving <i>news</i>, inspiring <i>music</i> and <i>mantra videos</i>, and practical advice on <i>yoga, </i> <i>meditation, ayurveda</i>, <i>astrology</i> and much more.</p>
<p>After launching the page we soon realized the great jewel we could serve the worldwide community with by extending our reach around the world with the <strong>Fortunate People Campaign</strong>.  Our initial page <u>facebook.com/fortunatepeoplesmile</u> became the ""bow"" for a very special ""enchanted arrow"" to bring the highest FORTUNE to the world - <strong>Fortunate-people.com</strong><br/><br/>Through Fortunate-people.com<strong>, </strong>we now have a platform to promote the Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra throughout the world by the simple appeal of recording people chanting and uploading the videos for everyone to see and be inspired.</p>
<p>Fortunate-people.com<strong> </strong>has begun gaining momentum on this beautiful journey with over 500(!) videos capturing over 7000(!) people chanting the Maha-Mantra for love &amp; peace. But our goal is even more challenging.</p>
<p><strong><i>We aspire to get 50,000 recorded chants dedicated to love &amp; peace! And, in this way, honour and congratulate Srila Prabhupada and his ISKCON movement for its amazing achievement of 50 years of service to the global society. </i></strong></p>
<p>It all began in London during Srila Prabhupada's December Marathon 2015.</p>

<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/oouupiaUcCc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p>At that time we were inspired by these words from Srila Prabhupada:<br/><br/><i>""We are making them fortunate. We are giving them service so they<br/>become fortunate. We are spending our blood, gallons of blood, to make them fortunate. This is the sacrifice of the devotee. […] So it is by the devotee's sacrifice that they are fortunate.""</i>  <br/>(Jan 18, 1974, Morning walk)</p>
<p><i>“This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is simply requesting people, ""Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa."" […] It is our duty to make all these misfortunate, unfortunate creatures fortunate. <u>That is our mission</u>.”<br/>​</i>( Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.8.30 Los Angeles, April 22, 1973)</p>
<p><strong>This became our motto</strong> – <strong><i>“Make them fortunate”</i></strong></p>
<p>Ever since, the Fortunate People team is trying to fulfill this mission and mood set by Srila Prabhupada, and so eagerly supported by all of his followers.</p>

<p><br/>Today, we ask you to join us in this effort by donating for the campaign. <strong>Our reason for asking you to help</strong> is very simple.</p>
<p>At first, when we launched the project our personal resources got us going. But we really didn't foresee all the fantastic opportunities that would open. The team at ISKCON Online (ISKCONOnline.com) stepped in to get us over the first goal – the launching of Fortunate-people.com.</p>
<p>The results have been immensely encouraging and we are more than convinced of the potential. But now we need to both maintain and expand the effort.</p>
<p><strong><i>With your help we can make this campaign successful and reach our 50,000 chants goal.</i></strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Driven by the success so far we have assembled a team of over 20(!) devotees. Most are serving as part-time volunteers. But a few are now serving full-time -  developing the web-site, editing and promoting the maha-mantra videos, updating the Facebook page and ultimately developing the virtual Maha Mantra community. It's already over 10,000(!) hours that our team spent in total working on this project.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how your support will promote the campaign</strong></p>
<p>With your support we will first maintain the existing work through to the end of the first campaign next year. And we will develop the <strong>Fortunate People Ambassadors</strong> and <strong>Fortunate People Awards</strong> extensions to our main page. </p>
<p><strong>Fortunate People Ambassadors</strong></p>
<p>This feature of the site will enable us to acknowledge the great efforts that many participants have already inspired the world with, such as the Tattva Darsi team collecting chants in the USA or the Radha-Krisna Temple team in the UK or single warriors like Bhakti Swarup Chaitanya Swami (over 80 videos) or Padmavati devi dasi in Holland. </p>
<p>Here’s a 2 min video of the on-going miracle Padmavati devi dasi is a part of:<br/><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/HPBekmlPFvI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><strong>Fortunate People Awards</strong></p>
<p>The Awards section would feature monthly TOP15 Mantra Charts of those chants shared in a musical, creative or inspirational way. We also aim to conclude with a beautiful ceremony in Mayapur at the Gaura Purnima Festival screening the best chants in different categories i.e. Amusing, Funny, Deep, Sincere, Lovely etc. Here is the second one we came up with:</p>

<p>By building our site to a highly professional level we aim to attract different high profile media channels like 'The New York Times', 'Huffington Post', or even BBC to cover the campaign. We aim to get celebrities like Russell Brand, Miley Cyrus, Tina Turner and many others to add their chants which could take the whole world by storm.</p>
<p>We are convinced that Fortunate People has the potential to contribute greatly in making the words ‘Hare Krishna’ a household phrase, as in 'take it easy’, 'let it go', 'just carry on' or merely ‘be happy’.</p>
<p>All this would contribute to a <i>completely new public image</i> of the Maha Mantra. This unique combination of the mood of having 'no hard and fast rules' for chanting this Maha Mantra and the Internet  opens a wonderful and tangible opportunity for the Holy Name to reach 'every town and village'.<br/><br/><strong>Our budget:</strong><br/>We've obtained professional estimates for the project ranging between $40-50 thousand dollars. But by engaging devotee professionals we have been able to bring the cost down to less than 25% of this. The following is our budget* for providing modest stipends to devotee-professionals who are contributing their time for the success of this project.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476115207/uvjm3v94meftwuh62aw3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><i>*ISKCON Online continues to support the Fortunate People campaign as its fiscal partner in the US.

<p><strong>If we fail to raise or exceed the amount needed</strong>:</p>

<h3>The Story So Far...</h3>
<p>Based in Ypsilanti, Toronto, Brooklyn, Champaign-Urbana and McKinney, The Cultural Gutter was founded in May, 2003 by writer, filmmaker and game designer Jim Munroe and comics critic and artist Guy Leshinski to provide thoughtful and provocative writing on disreputable art. Since then, we've had twelve editors in two countries and five cities write on comics, movies, filmi b-movies, tv, science fiction, fantasy, horror, romance, video games, and porn. And in all that time we paid our writers, both editors and Guest Stars. Then we lost our funding grant, but a small, rag-tag band of donors joined forces with the Gutter to keep us online and help us keep our commitment to paying writers for their work. Thus, the Gutterthon was born.<br/><br/>The Gutter offers thoughtful, well-written articles on topics like: <strong><a href=""http://theculturalgutter.com/comics/danger-diabolik-deep-deep-down.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the queerness of Mario Bava's <i>Danger: Diabolik</i></a></strong>; <strong><a href=""http://theculturalgutter.com/screen/time-loops-and-the-failures-of-memory.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">time loops and failures of memory</a></strong>; <strong><a href=""http://theculturalgutter.com/comics/the-amazing-jackie-ormes.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>the history of the first African American syndicated cartoonist, Jackie Ormes</i></a></strong>; <strong><a href=""http://theculturalgutter.com/screen/better-left-unsaid-the-unspoken-and-the-unexplained-in-hush.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the unspoken and the unexplained in horror</a></strong>; <strong><a href=""http://theculturalgutter.com/screen/from-superstar-to-maha-chor.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the decline and fall of filmi superstar, Rajesh Khanna</a></strong>; <strong><a href=""http://theculturalgutter.com/science-fiction/kungfu-powered-afrocyberpunk-pulp.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kung Fu-Powered Afro-Cyberpunk</a></strong>. Now our survival depends on the Gutterthon. So please click <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gutterthon-2016-media/payments/new"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back It</a> and keep the Gutter flowing with the writing you love. Even if you can only throw in a buck, we will thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>

Based in Ypsilanti, Toronto, Brooklyn, Champaign-Urbana and McKinney, The Cultural Gutter was founded in May, 2003 by writer, filmmaker and game designer Jim Munroe and comics critic and artist Guy Leshinski to provide thoughtful and provocative writing on disreputable art. Since then, we've had twelve editors in two countries and five cities write on comics, movies, filmi b-movies, tv, science fiction, fantasy, horror, romance, video games, and porn. And in all that time we paid our writers, both editors and Guest Stars. Then we lost our funding grant, but a small, rag-tag band of donors joined forces with the Gutter to keep us online and help us keep our commitment to paying writers for their work. Thus, the Gutterthon was born.The Gutter offers thoughtful, well-written articles on topics like: the queerness of Mario Bava's Danger: Diabolik; time loops and failures of memory; the history of the first African American syndicated cartoonist, Jackie Ormes; the unspoken and the unexplained in horror; the decline and fall of filmi superstar, Rajesh Khanna; Kung Fu-Powered Afro-Cyberpunk. Now our survival depends on the Gutterthon. So please click Back It and keep the Gutter flowing with the writing you love. Even if you can only throw in a buck, we will thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

What We Need & What You Get
Thanks to donors' help last year we raised enough to pay our new webhosts through 2016, so Gutterthon 2016 is all about the writing. Our $1600 goal breaks down to: $250/year/writer or about $20/article; $250/year for the Evil Overlord for publishing, promoting, finding new writers, day-to-day site management, co-ordinating the in-progress site redesign, making sure the perks are shipped out, and preparing the two Cultural Gutter Press books we plan to publish, The Cultural Gutter Presents Secrets Of Mantis Fist and Return To The Cultural Gutter a new collection of essays from the Gutter. The remaining $350 will go towards printing and shipping perks, promotional materials, paying occasional guest writers and paying Indiegogo and Paypal fees.
In return, along with thoughtful and provocative articles on subjects also get our undying and eternal thanks and your choice of some sweet perks.
Perks Include:A Cultural Gutter Membership package including a numbered and dated CG Membership Card and a decryption key for decoding the CG Secret Messages posted at the top of the Sponsor's Page.The British Fantasy Award-winning Fox Spirit Books has donated two hard copies of Eve Of War and five digital copies of The Evil Genius Guide! Eve of War is an anthology of tales from the battlefield edited by Mhairi Simpson and Darren Pulsford.  ""Sharp of mind and instinct; with poise and grace and power – Eve's Daughters are a match for any opponent. Whether seeking out a worthy test or assailed by brave (but foolish) foes, she is determined and cunning, and will not fail. Here are fifteen tales from across the ages; full of prowess both martial and magical, from an array of unique voices.""
The Evil Genius Guide is a slim volume of villainous flash fiction edited by Darren Pulsford. Tales of mad science! Evil creations! And REVENGE!
Our sister site Pornokitsch donated books from their Jurassic London imprint. You'll have your choice of one print copy of: Irregularity, The Book Of The Dead, The Lowest Heaven or A Town Called Pandemonium. ""Irregularity depicts the tension between order and chaos in the 17th and 18th centuries....From John Harrison to Ada Lovelace, Isaac Newton to Émilie du Châtelet, these stories showcase the Age of Reason in a very different light.""  The Book of the Dead  ""addresses the most fascinating of all the undead: the mummy. The mummy can be a figure of imperial dignity or one of shambling terror, at home in pulp adventure, contemporary drama, or apocalyptic horror,"" featuring stories by Gail Carriger and Paul Cornell. The Lowest Heaven is ""themed around a body in the Solar System, from the Sun to Halley's Comet. The stories are illustrated with photographs and artwork selected from the archives of the Royal Observatory, while the book's cover and overall design are the work of award-winning South African illustrator Joey Hi-Fi.""

NEW PERK UNLOCKED: The Cultural Gutter Presents Secret Diagrams of Mantis Fist! Long rumored and often denied, the Cultural Gutter's have been presented in this volume for the first time.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe in the power of stories. Stories have the power to create change. We, at Fistbump Media have witnessed this first-hand with Dan's self-published book, <i>The Unlikely Missionary: From Pew-Warmer to Poverty-Fighter</i>, and subsequently with countless other projects.</p>
<p><i>The Unlikely Missionary</i> has encouraged and inspired many to go and do something
bigger than themselves, to make a difference in the world, or even in their own backyard. It's inspired some to start blogging their own experiences and many have self-published their stories as well! This domino effect all started with one man's willingness to talk about his experiences and how they've changed him.</p>
<p>There are too many stories out there that never get told—this is a tragedy! So many people have such incredible stories already written, but they’ve never been heard because they haven't been published. Traditional publishing is difficult to pursue and obtain and many authors have no idea about this extreme power shift in the publishing industry! The result is, unfortunately, countless people who miss the opportunity to be inspired, encouraged, and changed. These are the people who are waiting for YOUR story and they don’t even know it yet! </p>
<p>Enter Fistbump Media! We are here to restore power to the writer! That's what this project is all about; it's about giving the writer with that awe-inspiring story all the tools they need to share their story effectively so people can be moved to change the world in unfathomable ways!</p>
<h3>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</h3>
<p>Of course, we know that you peeps are going to get us above and beyond our goal! So, in an alternate reality where this doesn't happen, we would have to scale back on production a bit (it's that or get our kiddos to work...which we hear is somewhat frowned upon...) and sacrifice depth of content. This means less info, but we would still pump out a Fistbump-worthy e-course!</p>

As a husband and father of two with a full time day job to pay the bills, it can be a delicate balance to find time to write. However, I am passionate about my stories and characters and am dedicated to completing my first trilogy, the <i>Empire's Foundation</i>. <br/><br/>
<p>Unfortunately, starting out as an indie author is tough going. Despite glowing reviews (<i>A Noble's Quest </i>is rated over 4 stars on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Nobles-Quest-Empires-Foundation-Book-ebook/dp/B0095MG1PM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazon</a>, <a href=""https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/224399"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smashwords</a>, and <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21446576-a-noble-s-quest"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goodreads</a>), word of mouth only travels so fast. There is no shortage of indie books on the market, and we also have to compete with traditional publishers who have the financial muscle to take most of the spotlight. <br/></p>
<p>Indie authors are grabbing more and more attention, not all of it good. While I've read some amazing books from indie authors, I've also read some bad ones that look like first drafts. Unedited, I haven't been able to finish them. <br/></p>
<p>That's why it's so important to me to pay for professional editing and cover art. I want to put out the best book that I can, so readers aren't disappointed. Word of mouth is hard enough to generate without killing your chances with poorly edited prose. <br/></p>
<p>Perhaps you have had an experience where you haven't picked up a series until it was finished, or near completion. I know several times that has been the case for me, where I only discover an author after they have finished a series and I hear someone say, ""You need to read this. The whole series was amazing!"" <br/></p>
<p>With your help, I can finish this series quickly. I am committed to finishing it, but if it were left to me to raise the funds alone, it would take years to save up. <br/></p>
<p></p>

<i>A Hero's Birth</i> is not the end of the story, but it <i>will</i> be my final crowd sourced project. Once this series is complete, my writing will have to sustain itself through sales. I will continue to write the next series, <i>Strongblade Siblings</i>, but it will only be published as I find the money to bring them out. <br/>
<p>With your help, I hope to one day write <a href=""https://ryantoxopeus.wordpress.com/timeline/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">10 books</a> (minimum) in this world that I created. But each epic journey begins with a single step. I've taken it with your help, and I just need a bit more momentum to keep me going.<br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I will be working with Shen Hart, who will be doing the developmental editing. I've known Shen for a few years, and she is highly regarded for her developmental editing and marketing knowledge. It will be a pleasure to work with her! She has given me a reduced rate of $1000 to help me with the flow of my manuscript. <br/></p>
<p>My Aunt Mary has offered to do the copy editing for free, with the cost of ""patience."" If you have read <i>A Noble's Quest </i>and/or<i> A Wizard's Gambit</i>, you know her amazing ability already. She works miracles with words, and I am forever in her debt. </p>
<p></p>

He's worth every penny, believe me! Not only do I get the book cover, but he does the painting on a large scale so it can be used for posters and any other advertising I might want. He has also offered to put together another promotional video for the project, with storyboard interleaved with artwork, followed up with a speed demonstration of his painting process. If you're not familiar with the videos, I highly recommend checking out the ones he has done for <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2boueUSnoEY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Noble's Quest</a></i> and <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGIoMNSD6Zg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Wizard's Gambit</a></i>. <br/><br/>
<p>I'm setting the goal for the project at $1000. I'm over half way through the first draft of <i>A Hero's Birth</i>, so the editing needs to be done ASAP. If I need to wait on the art, I will, as editing takes a great deal of time. The full $1800 sounds like a lot of money to me, but I think $1000 is achievable. <br/></p>
<p>If I reach $1000, I'll start stretch goals in $100 increments to get up to or beyond the $1800 mark. For each $100 above $1000 that is raised, Harvey will bring out a new character portrait (at a cost to me of $10 per picture) and I will include them with any physical perk, including international shipping. For the first $800, the characters will be: Eliza, Sarentha, Thomas, Ben, Ramar, Thurzin, Dowreth, Sharrow. </p>
<p>To give you an idea of what they will look like, I commissioned a card for Ramar, which you can see now.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1278263/files/20150308110657-Ramar-Sketch-Cards-small.jpg?1425838017"" src="""" style=""width: 333.431px; height: 414px;""/></p>If I somehow break the $1800 ceiling, I have a large pool of characters to choose from, and will put it up to a vote for those who have backed me with requests for physical perks. The list of characters is: Pellin, Marcus, Arus, Jordak, Gleriph, Gayle, Thrak, Thigglin, 
Ellie'nethise, Shump, Gum, Erwin, Denton, Lyle, Richard, Feng, 
Hallo'mien, Glezxnodin, and Adam.<br/><br/>
<p>Why would I need to go higher than $1800? Because there will be physical perks available, so not all of your donation will go towards my editing and artwork. For each perk I have set the donation price at Item Cost + Shipping Estimate + $5 Actual Donation. If I have multiple orders for the same items (i.e., 5 <i>A Noble's Quest </i>mugs) the price comes down, and more of the Item Cost translates into Actual Donation. Also, the Canada Post website is terrible at estimating shipping costs (I found out from my last Indiegogo), so any savings from multiple orders of the same items will likely disappear into shipping costs.</p>
<p>Any additional money above and beyond my needs will go toward extras, like bringing out the final map for the series. Harvey was kind enough to do the first map for free, and his rate was quite reasonable on the second. <br/></p>

<br/>All the way up to unique autographed canvas prints for the three covers for $250 each. <br/><br/>The e-books will be available (you will receive your e-book copy of <i>A Hero's Birth</i> before it's available for sale), as will print copies. I look at crowd source funding as an opportunity for people to pre-order the book they're helping to bring out. And for those people who want more, there will be posters, mugs, notebooks, magnets, and more! And don't forget those character cards from stretch goals. There's something for everyone! For a full list of perks, check them out on the side.<br/><br/>If I don't reach my goal, the money that is raised will go toward the editing. If I reach the initial goal, but don't reach $1800, the money will pay for editing first, and I will come up with the rest to pay for artwork eventually. <br/>
<p>One way or another, the trilogy will be finished. It will just take longer if I don't make the money with this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>""But you're a Canadian,"" you say. ""Why are you looking to raise USD?"" <br/></p>
<p>The editor and artist I'm working with take USD payments, so raising $1800 CAD would leave me over $300 short. <br/></p>

From Tolkien's work, to Feist, there have been few characters for women to get excited about. I believe it is the job of writers to give exposure and opportunity to all kinds of people - although not all in one book. Being inclusive of everyone is impossible. But when 50+% of the population is ignored as heroes in epic fantasy, there's a problem. <br/><br/>
<p>Eliza Winston is my part of the solution. She's strong-willed, spirited, and still feminine. Trained to use a crossbow when words fail, she isn't afraid of getting her hands dirty to reach her goals. <br/></p>
<p>There's another under-serviced group, and while men do have representation, it's skewed. We are bombarded with images of muscly men all the time, and in epic fantasy this translates into hardened war veterans with bulky physiques. <br/></p>
<p>There is little room for a thoughtful, reluctant hero like Thomas. Sure, he's a big guy, and can do some damage, but it takes a lot to make him fight. And a character who's scrawny and weaselly like Sarentha rarely gets any attention. <br/></p>
<p>Humans fall along a spectrum, and by helping to support my writing, you will start to see figures who are not the media-driven ""ideal,"" yet they become heroes in their own right. <br/></p>
<p>My last Indiegogo campaign made <i>A Wizard's Gambit </i>possible, and I hope you can help this one succeed as well! <br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are none, really. This last book will come out, sooner or later. It might take two or three more years, when my wife goes back to work and we have some extra money to do it, but it will come out eventually. Even if I have to squirrel away $10 a week to do it. </p>
<p>If the Canada Post website has grossly overestimated shipping costs, I will refund any excess to backers. <br/> </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I understand the economy went belly up, and has been slow to recover. Not everyone has money to help out. It might be obvious, but put your own financial security first. I would be eaten by guilt if I found out that people who are struggling to make ends meet donated to my campaign. <br/></p>
<p>If you really want to help, but can't contribute money, share my campaign. I'll be putting out daily ads all month with different angles. If any of them strike a chord with you, feel free to share them so others might find out about my writing. <br/></p>
<p>Alternatively, I've been told Indiegogo has some sharing tools you can use to spread the word. <br/></p>
<p>Whether you contribute financially, or by sharing, I thank you for your help. It means so much to me and my family. (My daughter boasted proudly to a local book store owner the other day that she has her very own copy of <i>A Noble's Quest</i>, and I look forward to adding to her collection!)</p>

As you can see, the world expands a great deal from A Noble's Quest (left) to A Wizard's Gambit (right). A Hero's Birth will again double the landmass, and will include both the map from A Wizard's Gambit, and a brand new map. There are many perks available: 
From my novella, Demon Invasion for $1 backers...



To mugs with the cover art on them...

All the way up to unique autographed canvas prints for the three covers for $250 each. The e-books will be available (you will receive your e-book copy of A Hero's Birth before it's available for sale), as will print copies. I look at crowd source funding as an opportunity for people to pre-order the book they're helping to bring out. And for those people who want more, there will be posters, mugs, notebooks, magnets, and more! And don't forget those character cards from stretch goals. There's something for everyone! For a full list of perks, check them out on the side.If I don't reach my goal, the money that is raised will go toward the editing. If I reach the initial goal, but don't reach $1800, the money will pay for editing first, and I will come up with the rest to pay for artwork eventually. 
One way or another, the trilogy will be finished. It will just take longer if I don't make the money with this Indiegogo campaign.
""But you're a Canadian,"" you say. ""Why are you looking to raise USD?"" 
The editor and artist I'm working with take USD payments, so raising $1800 CAD would leave me over $300 short. 

  The Impact

At GenreCon last year, attendees got to meet my daughter, who dressed up as Darth Vader. One cosplayer, Judge Daven Brown, bought a copy of the book and said, ""If you helped raise a little girl who is that awesome, what has that brain of yours created in this book?"" 
Epic fantasy has long been male-dominated. From Tolkien's work, to Feist, there have been few characters for women to get excited about. I believe it is the job of writers to give exposure and opportunity to all kinds of people - although not all in one book. Being inclusive of everyone is impossible. But when 50+% of the population is ignored as heroes in epic fantasy, there's a problem. 
Eliza Winston is my part of the solution. She's strong-willed, spirited, and still feminine. Trained to use a crossbow when words fail, she isn't afraid of getting her hands dirty to reach her goals. 
There's another under-serviced group, and while men do have representation, it's skewed. We are bombarded with images of muscly men all the time, and in epic fantasy this translates into hardened war veterans with bulky physiques. 
There is little room for a thoughtful, reluctant hero like Thomas. Sure, he's a big guy, and can do some damage, but it takes a lot to make him fight. And a character who's scrawny and weaselly like Sarentha rarely gets any attention. 
Humans fall along a spectrum, and by helping to support my writing, you will start to see figures who are not the media-driven ""ideal,"" yet they become heroes in their own right. 
My last Indiegogo campaign made A Wizard's Gambit possible, and I hope you can help this one succeed as well! 

  Risks & Challenges There are none, really. This last book will come out, sooner or later. It might take two or three more years, when my wife goes back to work and we have some extra money to do it, but it will come out eventually. Even if I have to squirrel away $10 a week to do it. 
If the Canada Post website has grossly overestimated shipping costs, I will refund any excess to backers.  

  Other Ways You Can Help I understand the economy went belly up, and has been slow to recover. Not everyone has money to help out. It might be obvious, but put your own financial security first. I would be eaten by guilt if I found out that people who are struggling to make ends meet donated to my campaign. 
If you really want to help, but can't contribute money, share my campaign. I'll be putting out daily ads all month with different angles. If any of them strike a chord with you, feel free to share them so others might find out about my writing. 
Alternatively, I've been told Indiegogo has some sharing tools you can use to spread the word. 
Whether you contribute financially, or by sharing, I thank you for your help. It means so much to me and my family. (My daughter boasted proudly to a local book store owner the other day that she has her very own copy of A Noble's Quest, and I look forward to adding to her collection!)



Direct donations: $320
These are donations from people outside the Indiegogo platform that I will add onto the total when calculating the total donations when figuring out how many character cards will be commissioned.

<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">Money is an obstacle and that's why I'm posting this project.  I need funds to get this book edited, have a cover designed, and the inside text formated properly for print.  </span></p>

<p>This is very painful to share, my wife and I wept a lot of tears that we had not shed in a while and it's not going to be easy to read. If you're hurting too much read about our story that's OK, you can skip this chapter. The main reason I'm sharing this is to let you know that there are others out there who feel your pain and to know that the advice I'm giving is based on real life experience.</p>
<p>With that being written, here's our story...</p>
<p>I was living in Japan for close to six years. Five years of that time were spent teaching English full time in two different very small rural towns in Southern Mie-Prefecture. Both of these towns we so rural that there was no expressways built to connect them to the rest of the bustling country most people think of when they think of the metropolises of Japan. The nearest movie theater was at least a 2 hour drive away. Even for most people who live in Mie-Prefecture, most never came as far South as I was living and when people in the nearest big city, Nagoya, heard where I lived they would look at me like I was a crazy mountain man. Mountains and ocean was really all there was, and a lot of great people in that area who had really big heats. During this time was when I met my wife, a sweet local girl who I had to beg over the course of a couple of years to go on a date with me. After I got the chance to show her my charm on some dates we later married and got started having a family right away.</p>
<p>During my time in Japan I was building up my language skills and studying to take a language proficiency exam that December. This was my original pie in the sky goal for me when I first came to Japan, to pass the highest level language proficiency exam.</p>
<p>The teaching employment contract I had expired in August of that year since then I had been studying at least twelve hours a day in preparation for this test.</p>
<p>We made a conscious family decision that I would not work, but rather study until the test was taken and live off of savings during this time. My wife, 20 month old daughter and I moved to a very cheap rental house in my wife's home town. This house was owned by a wealthy man who owned the sawmill located at the end of the street we lived on. It was a nice house for what we paid and one of the amenities was that in the summer time it was shaded by the mountain next to us every day at noon when the sun moved far enough across the sky to hide behind the mountain. I particularly liked that it had about fifteen wild monkeys that lived on the mountain and would cross the street in front of us carrying the baby monkeys on their backs regularly. My wife hated that they would toss our garbage everywhere but being from the midwest, I thought it was rather funny. We also had a very kind neighbor in front of us that was a retired coast guard officer and liked to grow flowers.</p>
<p>Our daughter was quite a handful, especially since my wife was pregnant. With her parents close by there was lots of help and everyone pitched in to help give me the time I needed to study quietly at home.</p>
<p>Our first daughter had been born fairly healthy but had needed to be delivered via C-section and was kept in an incubator for about a week. Between my Japanese skills and memory having faded since then it was basically something related to my wife's blood pressure so they scheduled a C-section and our daughter was born one week prior to the expected date. As far as I could tell it was nothing major, but in Japan they tend to require far more hospitalization for rather minor conditions. This practice was more than I had ever seen in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>Because of the circumstances regarding our first born daughter, the doctors and nurses took care to watch of any signs of abnormality in her second pregnancy. Every visit we left reassured that all signs were positive and we were going to have a healthy baby.</p>
<p>My wife was very active during her second pregnancy. Not only is she very active in general, but also had our daughter to chase around.

<p>In mid-October my wife was cooking and told me she was a little worried because the baby hadn't moved since the night before.

They let her know if she was really that concerned, she could come in and get checked out but everything was probably just fine.

They didn't know exactly what was wrong, but, there were two options: One option was to put my wife in an ambulance and drive her to a major hospital (about 2 hours away) where they had all the proper medical equipment to save babies. The problem with this was that the Doctor was sure the baby would die before the ambulance arrived at the hospital. The other option was to perform a C-section immediately and pull the baby out and do whatever they could do to try to save my baby, but since they didn't have all the proper medical equipment at that hospital the chances of it surviving was not good and the baby would probably die.</p>

Short Summary
Several years ago my wife & I lost our full term baby as a stillbirth.  It destroyed us.  This is the book I wish I would have had walking out of the hospital to know what I was in for and what to expect moving forward.  
My dream is if money were not an issue I'd drive hospital to hospital and make sure no parents of a stillborn baby go home without this book in hand to help them with the tough journey ahead of them.  Stillbirths are devestating to families.  Those parents need help. This book delivers hope and helps take away some of the pain. 
Money is an obstacle and that's why I'm posting this project.  I need funds to get this book edited, have a cover designed, and the inside text formated properly for print.  
Every contribution helps, and is appreciated.  Getting this published is the first step in keeping this dream moving forward.  
If someone were to donate a very large sum of money I'd start working on the next stages of the dream, going hospital to hospital to get this in the hands of those who need it most. 
Complete Summary 
Anyone who's lost a baby feels like they should have died instead and are a total failure of a parent.  Several years ago my wife and I lost our full term unborn baby for no explainable medical reason.  It completely devastated us.
My wife had access to many books and support groups. All of them were packed with information on how to deal with the feelings about your body after carrying a lost child.  As a man that information was not very helpful and I was left on my own to 'figure it out.'
Several years later my co-worker experienced the same loss in his family. After sharing the story of how I managed to live life again and how we had a healthy baby after our second baby died, it helped him cope.  Reliving the pain was difficult but the joy that came from helping another family was tremendous.
This is our story of how we worked through the pain.  It's a road-map for fathers helping their family to overcome this incredibly difficult experience.  It's the guide I wish I would have had while trying to pick up the pieces of our shattered life.
These important questions families have are all answered:


Why did God let this happen?


Is my baby in heaven?


Did this happen because I'm a horrible parent?


Can I take pictures of my baby?


Should I have a funeral?


How long will I feel like a failure?


Will I ever be able to live normally again?


Will people understand I want to be left alone?


How can I best support my wife?


What should I say to parents who have lost their baby?


How can I help someone going through this?


What should I do with the baby stuff?


When will we have sex again?


Should we have more kids?


How can I memorialize my child?

Every 20 minutes in the United States a baby is stillborn. There are twice as many stillbirths as deaths due to HIV/AIDS.  These families are sent home without a baby or a clue how to cope with what happened.  
This pain is unimaginable.  Your contribution will help bring hope to these families who are truly hurting.
What We Need & What You Get
Here's how your contribution will used:
Editor - The story and advice are invaluable.  However, the text needs to be looked at by someone who is a talented writer to clean it up so my grammar and punctuation errors are not distracting to the reader.  A professional editor for this project costs $1,000.
Designer - Page layout, cover design, and all the little details that go into transforming a long electronic document into a printed book format needs someone who knows what they are doing.  It will cost $1000 to get the raw edited text into book format with a well designed cover.
Padding - Something always happens.  There's an extra $500 in padding budgeted in for those random shipping costs, a software program that needs to be purchased to do that one thing that you just can't do in the program you already have, the hidden fees that come out of no where, etc, etc. 
Your support of this book will help create a resource that's full of needed advice for hurting families and a positive experience for the reader.  
When your perk is delivered the book will feel and read professional.  As a donor, you deserve that.  The families out there who desperately need this information and are looking for answers deserve that.
If I don't reach my goal I'll publish the book in its current form and make a cover myself. This is not nearly as desirable as a professional editor and designer doing it but the contained message getting to the people who need it are what's most important.
The Impact
Your contribution will make a huge difference.  You're helping fund a resource that is badly needed for fathers on a subject that's rarely discussed.  Families of stillbirths are looking for answers.  There's virtually nothing out there for fathers.  Because of your donation they can know what to expect and what they can do.

Sample of What You Are Supporting...
This is very painful to share, my wife and I wept a lot of tears that we had not shed in a while and it's not going to be easy to read. If you're hurting too much read about our story that's OK, you can skip this chapter. The main reason I'm sharing this is to let you know that there are others out there who feel your pain and to know that the advice I'm giving is based on real life experience.
With that being written, here's our story...
I was living in Japan for close to six years. Five years of that time were spent teaching English full time in two different very small rural towns in Southern Mie-Prefecture. Both of these towns we so rural that there was no expressways built to connect them to the rest of the bustling country most people think of when they think of the metropolises of Japan. The nearest movie theater was at least a 2 hour drive away. Even for most people who live in Mie-Prefecture, most never came as far South as I was living and when people in the nearest big city, Nagoya, heard where I lived they would look at me like I was a crazy mountain man. Mountains and ocean was really all there was, and a lot of great people in that area who had really big heats. During this time was when I met my wife, a sweet local girl who I had to beg over the course of a couple of years to go on a date with me. After I got the chance to show her my charm on some dates we later married and got started having a family right away.
During my time in Japan I was building up my language skills and studying to take a language proficiency exam that December. This was my original pie in the sky goal for me when I first came to Japan, to pass the highest level language proficiency exam.
The teaching employment contract I had expired in August of that year since then I had been studying at least twelve hours a day in preparation for this test.
We made a conscious family decision that I would not work, but rather study until the test was taken and live off of savings during this time. My wife, 20 month old daughter and I moved to a very cheap rental house in my wife's home town. This house was owned by a wealthy man who owned the sawmill located at the end of the street we lived on. It was a nice house for what we paid and one of the amenities was that in the summer time it was shaded by the mountain next to us every day at noon when the sun moved far enough across the sky to hide behind the mountain. I particularly liked that it had about fifteen wild monkeys that lived on the mountain and would cross the street in front of us carrying the baby monkeys on their backs regularly. My wife hated that they would toss our garbage everywhere but being from the midwest, I thought it was rather funny. We also had a very kind neighbor in front of us that was a retired coast guard officer and liked to grow flowers.
Our daughter was quite a handful, especially since my wife was pregnant. With her parents close by there was lots of help and everyone pitched in to help give me the time I needed to study quietly at home.
Our first daughter had been born fairly healthy but had needed to be delivered via C-section and was kept in an incubator for about a week. Between my Japanese skills and memory having faded since then it was basically something related to my wife's blood pressure so they scheduled a C-section and our daughter was born one week prior to the expected date. As far as I could tell it was nothing major, but in Japan they tend to require far more hospitalization for rather minor conditions. This practice was more than I had ever seen in the U.S.A.
Because of the circumstances regarding our first born daughter, the doctors and nurses took care to watch of any signs of abnormality in her second pregnancy. Every visit we left reassured that all signs were positive and we were going to have a healthy baby.
My wife was very active during her second pregnancy. Not only is she very active in general, but also had our daughter to chase around. During that time she always seemed to feel great and felt the baby kicking and moving in the womb. Happy wife, healthy daughter and a healthy newborn that was to be due December 1st. Even though I was unemployed and studying like crazy, all things were looking good and there was a lot to be happy about.
In mid-October my wife was cooking and told me she was a little worried because the baby hadn't moved since the night before. I blew it off because there seemed to be no end to the old wives tales going around that small town in regards to pregnancy. I told her to give it some time and if she still felt the same concern in a couple of hours we could go to the hospital.
Later that night we finished dinner and my wife said she felt like there had been some small movements but far less than normal so she was concerned. The local hospital had a hotline for expecting mothers to call if they had questions and she went ahead and called. They asked a couple of routine questions and sounded as skeptical as I felt. They let her know if she was really that concerned, she could come in and get checked out but everything was probably just fine. It was around 8 pm at night and my wife opted to go in and get checked out.
(Wife: The hospital was reluctant to have me come in. My town is small and they only have one OBGYN that the city hospital had to pay nearly double the average salary to have him move to our rural town.

<p><b>BIOSKETCH: MICHAEL HOLLOWAY KING, MD</b></p>
<p>I have had four decades of experience across a broad
spectrum of healthcare and communication skills. I graduated from Harvard
College (1975) and Harvard Medical School (1980). In college, I focused on
social, developmental, cross-cultural, and neuropsychology–– especially
bio-personality and consciousness. I then pursued studies in neuropsychiatry
and international public health in medical school.</p>
<p>Subsequently, I specialized in mind-body psychotherapy
in my <i>alternative</i> medical practice, and also worked in virtually every
aspect of <i>conventional</i> primary care. I am the first physician to address
the topic of shame and social oppression, pinpoint their psychobiological
roots, and devise a treatment program for their toxic ramifications, which effectively
advances the biomedical sciences by 20-50 years</p>
<p>I became an expert in advanced reading and writing
technology, listening skills, and public speaking as a communications skills
trainer. I have been a national lecturer on stress management and frequent
radio show guest and host. I am rapidly earning a reputation as a brilliant
writer since publishing “Hide and Play Dead” in August 2013. “Shame on You!”
will be my <i>second</i> published work, with more sequels waiting the
propitious moment to be released.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________</p>
<p><b>THE BRAIN-FREEING AND PARADIGM-SHIFTING PROJECT</b></p>
<p><i>There has never been a project of this magnitude
and urgency.</i></p>
<p>About three years ago I made a visionary decision to
take on a tremendously challenging, far-reaching and potentially risky project
to implement my discoveries in carefully designed stages, even knowing that the
repercussions of doing so would threaten and challenge the corporate elite,
transform academia, revise our social institutions, and probably accelerate the
evolutionary stage of our species.</p>
<p>I devised a bold stepwise strategy beginning with the
first of a series of books that are capable of freeing the reader from the
“mind cap” of social oppression and its correlates, and quickly leading up to
the application of powerful, but non-invasive and safe, technological
inventions to directly free the human brain from oppressive and traumatic
imprints— as well as advance the curative scope of modern medicine by several
decades.</p>
<p>Here is a partial list of what this project represents
and the essence of what you will help me achieve:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The creation of riveting and emotionally compelling
literary masterpieces…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The invention of a new writing technology, advancing
literary “healing” far beyond the limitations of self-help books…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The début of a powerful therapy system to repel the
toxic effects of oppression…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The disclosure of hundreds of first-ever revelations
that revise our collective cultural history…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The full depiction of the true nature of shame, abuse,
trauma and social oppression…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The long-awaited treatise that will change the social
and political sciences…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The acceleration of the course of social engineering,
with an impact upon all aspects of life— from childrearing to adult relationships,
from the meaning of life to death with dignity…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The clearest path to resist social inequity and curb the
core of human suffering…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The consolidation of a peaceful resistance movement
against the agenda of the corporate elite: a two-class society, elimination of
our democratic government, and neoslavery of the working class…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The preliminary stage to introduce fully researched and
tested technological inventions that not only resolve trauma and repel
oppression, but also advance the curative power of medicine and psychiatry by
several decades, and also accelerate the evolution of the human brain…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The retrieval of innate psychic skills, inherent in our
survival instincts, which offer the experience of expanded awareness and
ecstatic states, and possibly leading to a spiritual renaissance…</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>_________________________________________________________</p>
<p>“Shame on You!” is a summary of social oppression in
America. In our <i>majority minority</i> nation, most people have experienced
some form of rejection or abuse— sometimes in the workplace, at home, or within
a social institution.</p>
<p>My work teaches people to recognize toxic shame and
abuse, reverse or repel trauma and oppression, and re-invoke the state of
blissful love, to then engage with loving and trustworthy peers. But it is
difficult to do this when our brains have been warped by childrearing
practices, educational systems, corporate indoctrination, and institutional
propaganda. To get off the radar screen of human predators, and to quickly get
out of an abusive or exploitative situation, are critical for survival.</p>
<p>Yet it is nearly impossible after the age of twenty-five
to stay creative, centered, focused and loving as one struggles to protect his
or her integrity and boundaries. With <i>increasing</i> age and relentless
stress, the human brain becomes <i>increasingly</i> imbalanced: Cynicism,
prejudice, self-doubt, compulsions, restricted social lives, remorse, and
postponed gratification of essential human needs, tend to dominate most

<p><b>GOALS AND PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT</b></p>
<p>As a duet, the first two books are carefully constructed
to accomplish many literary, academic, sociopolitical and visionary goals. In
essence, “Hide and Play Dead” is an extraordinary enticement, a remarkable and
timely “hook”, that subtly opens the dialectic about freedom and slavery and
promises to show the reader how to attain a full knowledge about the nature of
oppression and a full training in how to also achieve liberation in this
sequel, “Shame on You!” <i>Both</i> books dare to free readers from oppressive
imprints using advanced neuropsychological principles applied to the
process of reading.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been left dangling, unclear or
unconscious in “Hide and Play Dead”, where the emphasis is on attaining a
strong <i>emotional</i> bond with the reader and to impact the limbic system of
the human brain, will be spelled out, made clear and brought into full
consciousness with detailed explanations in “Shame on You!” The new book
elaborates a treatise, demonstrates somatic principles by “exercises”, and
includes an expanded range of examples, such as case histories and further
personal narratives.</p>
<p>“Shame on You” will highlight and critique many
sensitive and thorny social issues related to oppression and <i>clearly</i> set
forth a new paradigm for the social sciences with graphic explanations in <i>explicit
text</i> that define the ""shame, abuse, trauma and oppression""
paradigm from developmental and bio-psychological angles. It will present the
technology of shame, abuse, and trauma desensitization, and the “cure” for
oppression.</p>
<p>This second book is 90% completed and will be more
academic than my first book, but also more humorous in a reader-friendly way.
It will include a wider and more scathing <i>social critique</i> of sensitive
issues related to oppression. I will reveal pioneer discoveries about the
nature of human predation, and demonstrate a variety of treatments for social
oppression that can be implemented on a mass scale. </p>
<p>I truly believe that the ultimate agenda of attaining
liberation from oppression is the most worthy cause I could aspire to have in
my lifetime. There are many reasons to resist the corporate elite’s final
conquest, which may well lead to the demise of American democracy, a two-class
society, and systematic social oppression. </p>
<p>The ""Occupy Wall Street"", the ""99%
Movement"", the rift in Congress and the resurgence of racism seen during
the last election, the deepening schism of wealth, and lack of transparency in
government, make this work into a banner or a slogan about self-liberation from
the reinstitution of subtle, but devastating, mass enslavement. The
concept of neoslavery helps unify and galvanize the disparate elements of a
populist resistance to this crisis that emerged in the past two presidential
elections.</p>

<p></p></div>","BIOSKETCH: MICHAEL HOLLOWAY KING, MD
I have had four decades of experience across a broad
spectrum of healthcare and communication skills. I graduated from Harvard
College (1975) and Harvard Medical School (1980). In college, I focused on
social, developmental, cross-cultural, and neuropsychology–– especially
bio-personality and consciousness. I then pursued studies in neuropsychiatry
and international public health in medical school.
Subsequently, I specialized in mind-body psychotherapy
in my alternative medical practice, and also worked in virtually every
aspect of conventional primary care. I am the first physician to address
the topic of shame and social oppression, pinpoint their psychobiological
roots, and devise a treatment program for their toxic ramifications, which effectively
advances the biomedical sciences by 20-50 years
I became an expert in advanced reading and writing
technology, listening skills, and public speaking as a communications skills
trainer. I have been a national lecturer on stress management and frequent
radio show guest and host. I am rapidly earning a reputation as a brilliant
writer since publishing “Hide and Play Dead” in August 2013. “Shame on You!”
will be my second published work, with more sequels waiting the
propitious moment to be released.
_________________________________________________________
THE BRAIN-FREEING AND PARADIGM-SHIFTING PROJECT
There has never been a project of this magnitude
and urgency.
About three years ago I made a visionary decision to
take on a tremendously challenging, far-reaching and potentially risky project
to implement my discoveries in carefully designed stages, even knowing that the
repercussions of doing so would threaten and challenge the corporate elite,
transform academia, revise our social institutions, and probably accelerate the
evolutionary stage of our species.
I devised a bold stepwise strategy beginning with the
first of a series of books that are capable of freeing the reader from the
“mind cap” of social oppression and its correlates, and quickly leading up to
the application of powerful, but non-invasive and safe, technological
inventions to directly free the human brain from oppressive and traumatic
imprints— as well as advance the curative scope of modern medicine by several
decades.
Here is a partial list of what this project represents
and the essence of what you will help me achieve:


The creation of riveting and emotionally compelling
literary masterpieces…


The invention of a new writing technology, advancing
literary “healing” far beyond the limitations of self-help books…


The début of a powerful therapy system to repel the
toxic effects of oppression…


The disclosure of hundreds of first-ever revelations
that revise our collective cultural history…


The full depiction of the true nature of shame, abuse,
trauma and social oppression…


The long-awaited treatise that will change the social
and political sciences…


The acceleration of the course of social engineering,
with an impact upon all aspects of life— from childrearing to adult relationships,
from the meaning of life to death with dignity…


The clearest path to resist social inequity and curb the
core of human suffering…


The consolidation of a peaceful resistance movement
against the agenda of the corporate elite: a two-class society, elimination of
our democratic government, and neoslavery of the working class…


The preliminary stage to introduce fully researched and
tested technological inventions that not only resolve trauma and repel
oppression, but also advance the curative power of medicine and psychiatry by
several decades, and also accelerate the evolution of the human brain…


The retrieval of innate psychic skills, inherent in our
survival instincts, which offer the experience of expanded awareness and
ecstatic states, and possibly leading to a spiritual renaissance…


_________________________________________________________
“Shame on You!” is a summary of social oppression in
America. In our majority minority nation, most people have experienced
some form of rejection or abuse— sometimes in the workplace, at home, or within
a social institution.
My work teaches people to recognize toxic shame and
abuse, reverse or repel trauma and oppression, and re-invoke the state of
blissful love, to then engage with loving and trustworthy peers. But it is
difficult to do this when our brains have been warped by childrearing
practices, educational systems, corporate indoctrination, and institutional
propaganda. To get off the radar screen of human predators, and to quickly get
out of an abusive or exploitative situation, are critical for survival.
Yet it is nearly impossible after the age of twenty-five
to stay creative, centered, focused and loving as one struggles to protect his
or her integrity and boundaries. With increasing age and relentless
stress, the human brain becomes increasingly imbalanced: Cynicism,
prejudice, self-doubt, compulsions, restricted social lives, remorse, and
postponed gratification of essential human needs, tend to dominate most
individual’s consciousness.
_________________________________________________________
GOALS AND PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
As a duet, the first two books are carefully constructed
to accomplish many literary, academic, sociopolitical and visionary goals. In
essence, “Hide and Play Dead” is an extraordinary enticement, a remarkable and
timely “hook”, that subtly opens the dialectic about freedom and slavery and
promises to show the reader how to attain a full knowledge about the nature of
oppression and a full training in how to also achieve liberation in this
sequel, “Shame on You!” Both books dare to free readers from oppressive
imprints using advanced neuropsychological principles applied to the
process of reading.
Whatever may have been left dangling, unclear or
unconscious in “Hide and Play Dead”, where the emphasis is on attaining a
strong emotional bond with the reader and to impact the limbic system of
the human brain, will be spelled out, made clear and brought into full
consciousness with detailed explanations in “Shame on You!” The new book
elaborates a treatise, demonstrates somatic principles by “exercises”, and
includes an expanded range of examples, such as case histories and further
personal narratives.
“Shame on You” will highlight and critique many
sensitive and thorny social issues related to oppression and clearly set
forth a new paradigm for the social sciences with graphic explanations in explicit
text that define the ""shame, abuse, trauma and oppression""
paradigm from developmental and bio-psychological angles. It will present the
technology of shame, abuse, and trauma desensitization, and the “cure” for
oppression.
This second book is 90% completed and will be more
academic than my first book, but also more humorous in a reader-friendly way.
It will include a wider and more scathing social critique of sensitive
issues related to oppression. I will reveal pioneer discoveries about the
nature of human predation, and demonstrate a variety of treatments for social
oppression that can be implemented on a mass scale. 
I truly believe that the ultimate agenda of attaining
liberation from oppression is the most worthy cause I could aspire to have in
my lifetime. There are many reasons to resist the corporate elite’s final
conquest, which may well lead to the demise of American democracy, a two-class
society, and systematic social oppression. 
The ""Occupy Wall Street"", the ""99%

the reinstitution of subtle, but devastating, mass enslavement. The
concept of neoslavery helps unify and galvanize the disparate elements of a

<h3>Ducky Needs You!</h3>
<p>Every Sunday at 7:00 ET fans of a dog named Ducky head over to read the newest conversation between him and his Daddy at <a href=""wellthatsjustducky.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Well That's Just Ducky!</a> For four years Ducky and his dad have discussed matters of life and death, love and loss, hope and despair, cats and dogs, and why dinner is late again. Funny and at times poignant, the conversations have connected with animal lovers around the world. </p>
<p>After much encouragement from Ducky fans, he and his daddy are releasing a self published book in which new conversations and favorite ones from the last few years are blended together to tell the story of one important year in their lives together. Short enough to finish in one sitting, but broken up in a way that will allow it to be enjoyed in bite sized moments, and written in a way sure to please both existing fans and first time readers, the book will include the charming, candid, full color photos of Ducky that always accompany his posts. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Here's How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Ducky and his daddy are trying to keep things lean and mean, but still there are expenses.</p>
<ul>
<li>We're hoping to raise $1000 with this campaign. The money will be used to cover the expenses associated with things like getting an ISBN, designing a cover, ordering proofs, distributing copies, and other unplanned expenses that may arise when a first time author and his dog try to self publish a book and suddenly realize they can't do it all on their own!

Every Sunday at 7:00 ET fans of a dog named Ducky head over to read the newest conversation between him and his Daddy at Well That's Just Ducky! For four years Ducky and his dad have discussed matters of life and death, love and loss, hope and despair, cats and dogs, and why dinner is late again. Funny and at times poignant, the conversations have connected with animal lovers around the world. 
After much encouragement from Ducky fans, he and his daddy are releasing a self published book in which new conversations and favorite ones from the last few years are blended together to tell the story of one important year in their lives together. Short enough to finish in one sitting, but broken up in a way that will allow it to be enjoyed in bite sized moments, and written in a way sure to please both existing fans and first time readers, the book will include the charming, candid, full color photos of Ducky that always accompany his posts. 


Here's How You Can Help
Ducky and his daddy are trying to keep things lean and mean, but still there are expenses.

We're hoping to raise $1000 with this campaign. The money will be used to cover the expenses associated with things like getting an ISBN, designing a cover, ordering proofs, distributing copies, and other unplanned expenses that may arise when a first time author and his dog try to self publish a book and suddenly realize they can't do it all on their own! If we end up raising more than we need we will use the extra money for marketing and increasing Ducky's web presence and, if the book is well received, future published works.
Contributors will qualify for a variety of perks based on their level of contribution including promotion on ""Well, That's Just Ducky"", autographed copies, magnets, pins, and even Ducky posts about the contributor!  
If we don't make our goal, we will still publish, but we may not be able to hit our deadline of having the book available for the 2014 holiday season and may not be able to get copies in the hands of as many influencers as we might like. But every little bit helps, so please consider giving what you can fit within your budget.

Studies</i>
</h1><h2>Introduction
</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
My
name is Mike Bishop and I am the founding editor of the<i> Journal of
Roman Military Equipment Studies</i> (<i>JRMES</i>). This campaign
aims to publish two volumes of the journal (14/15 at the end of April
2015 and 16 at the end of July 2015). At the same time, <i>Arma</i>,
the Newsletter of the Roman Military Equipment Conference will be
restarted. These events will herald the creation of the Association
of Roman Military Equipment Studies (ARMES) to act as publisher for
future volumes of the journal and coordinator for future Roman
Military Equipment Conferences (ROMECs). By contributing to the
campaign, anybody with an interest in Roman military equipment can
help secure a future for both the journal and the newsletter.
</p>
<h2>
Background and the target
</h2>
<p>
The
video provides some detail of the background to the foundation of
<i>JRMES</i>.</p>Whilst
this campaign is specifically aimed at raising funds to print volumes
14/15 and 16 of the <i>Journal of Roman Military Equipment Studies</i>,
it will lay the foundations for the establishment of a learned or
academic society to take over publication in the future and enable
contributors to become subscribers, should they wish to do so, from
2016 onwards.<br/><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Volume
14/15 is a general issue with a range of papers (including the siege
of Pompeii, <i>lorica segmentata</i>, scale armour, swords, the
manufacture of caltrops, and Late Roman equipment in Britain), whilst
16 contains papers from ROMEC XV held in Budapest in 2005 on the
theme <i>The Enemies of Rome</i>.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
funding target (£6,000) is designed to allow the printing of a
minimum of 200 copies of both volumes 14/15 and 16 which could be
achieved with 200 <b>Legionarius</b> or 400 <b>Eques</b>
subscriptions (or any combination of the two). That figure of 200
copies is important because of the printing costs (which
paradoxically spiral upwards as the number printed reduces: in other
words, the unit cost increases) and the need to provide paper
journals for libraries (and all others who want it).
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A
range of perks are outlined below, offering both digital and physical
(dead-tree) versions of the journal and newsletter. It is of course
possible to combine perks by adding (for example) <b>Legionarius</b>
(paper journals and PDF newsletter) with <b>Auxiliarius</b> (paper
newsletter), which is especially useful if you prefer dead-tree
versions of everything.
</p>
<h2>
Open access
</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
In
addition to providing digital options for current volumes,<i>JRMES</i>
will now be pursuing an Open Access policy whereby, 5 years after
publication, all content from the journal and newsletter will be
released as PDFs under a Creative Commons licence. Back issues (from
volume 1 onwards) will gradually be made available over a period of
time to bring them up to date (conversion of older issues takes a lot
of time and effort).
</p>
<h2>
The perks
</h2>
<p>
The
perks on offer are as follows:
</p>
<h3>
Calo
</h3>
<p>Digital
newsletter only [2 PDF issues of <i>Arma</i>]</p><h3>Auxiliarius

</h3><p>Paper
newsletter only [2 issues of <i>Arma</i>]</p><h3>

</p>
<p>plus

</p>
<p>plus

</h3>
<p>Full

issues of <i>Arma</i>]
</p>
<p>plus
listing as founder member in journal 
</p>
<p>plus
paper journals signed by editorial committee
</p>
<p>plus
dinner with the editor of <i>JRMES</i> at Claridges (travel to and
from your responsibility).</p><h2>
What happens if the campaign does not reach its
target?
</h2>
<p>
That’s
the end of <i>JRMES</i>, basically.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This
has to be an all-or-nothing campaign. As print-runs decrease in size,
so unit costs increase, and current printing technology means that
both offset-litho and digital printing still dictate a minimum
print-run of 200 to make the perks affordable. This may change in the
future; in years to come, if print-on-demand (POD) technology
continues to improve (and decrease in cost) the possibility exists
that digital will become the normal type of subscription but with an
option for an affordable POD version as an addition to the
subscription. We are not there yet, so we must work with what we
have: offset-litho printing for dead-tree journals and PDF for
digital.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a
contributor, you have the chance to be directly involved in securing
the future for the <i>Journal of Roman Military Equipment Studies</i>
and establishing an association dedicated to furthering the study of
a subject that matters to you. Make a difference: bring back <i>JRMES</i>!</p><p>
</p><h2>Don’t want to part with cash but still want to
help?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You can still help <i>JRMES</i> even if you can’t
afford to contribute financially. Share our campaign through social
media or email details to somebody who might be interested. All help is most welcome and truly appreciated.<br/></p>

it will lay the foundations for the establishment of a learned or
academic society to take over publication in the future and enable
contributors to become subscribers, should they wish to do so, from
2016 onwards.Volume
14/15 is a general issue with a range of papers (including the siege
of Pompeii, lorica segmentata, scale armour, swords, the
manufacture of caltrops, and Late Roman equipment in Britain), whilst
16 contains papers from ROMEC XV held in Budapest in 2005 on the
theme The Enemies of Rome.

The
funding target (£6,000) is designed to allow the printing of a
minimum of 200 copies of both volumes 14/15 and 16 which could be
achieved with 200 Legionarius or 400 Eques
subscriptions (or any combination of the two). That figure of 200
copies is important because of the printing costs (which
paradoxically spiral upwards as the number printed reduces: in other
words, the unit cost increases) and the need to provide paper
journals for libraries (and all others who want it).

A
range of perks are outlined below, offering both digital and physical
(dead-tree) versions of the journal and newsletter. It is of course
possible to combine perks by adding (for example) Legionarius
(paper journals and PDF newsletter) with Auxiliarius (paper
newsletter), which is especially useful if you prefer dead-tree
versions of everything.


Open access


In
addition to providing digital options for current volumes,JRMES
will now be pursuing an Open Access policy whereby, 5 years after
publication, all content from the journal and newsletter will be
released as PDFs under a Creative Commons licence. Back issues (from
volume 1 onwards) will gradually be made available over a period of
time to bring them up to date (conversion of older issues takes a lot
of time and effort).

The
perks on offer are as follows:

What happens if the campaign does not reach its
target?


That’s
the end of JRMES, basically.

This
has to be an all-or-nothing campaign. As print-runs decrease in size,
so unit costs increase, and current printing technology means that
both offset-litho and digital printing still dictate a minimum
print-run of 200 to make the perks affordable. This may change in the
future; in years to come, if print-on-demand (POD) technology
continues to improve (and decrease in cost) the possibility exists
that digital will become the normal type of subscription but with an
option for an affordable POD version as an addition to the
subscription. We are not there yet, so we must work with what we
have: offset-litho printing for dead-tree journals and PDF for
digital.


As a
contributor, you have the chance to be directly involved in securing
the future for the Journal of Roman Military Equipment Studies
and establishing an association dedicated to furthering the study of
a subject that matters to you. Make a difference: bring back JRMES!

<h3>Dreams from the Witch House: Female Voices of Lovecraftian Horror Illustrated by Daniele Serra from the Publisher of World War Cthulhu: A Collection of Lovecraftian War Stories</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The history of the Old World is shrouded in secrecy. Creatures and forces unimaginable inhabited this realm for eons, long before any human navigated the surface of the earth.  As the Old Ones have slumbered or observed from afar, humans have assembled civilization upon this fragile planet. Yet the whispers from the elders have been growing stronger, their energy once again seeping into the world. These whispers are being felt throughout the earth; from the roots of our flora to the dreams of our children.  They are preparing us for what is to come.</p>
<p>In Dreams from the Witch House: Female Voices of Lovecraftian Horror the most intuitive dreamers have been assembled to give us glimpses into these ancient terrors and their whispered warnings. Featuring authors Joyce Carol Oates, Caitlín R. Kiernan, Lois Gresh, Gemma Files, Nancy Kilpatrick, Elizabeth Bear, Storm Constantine and others accompanied by the lavish artwork of Daniele Serra, Dreams from the Witch House: Female Voices of Lovecraftian Horror is a representation of some of the finest cosmic horror and weird fiction from female authors in the field today.</p>

Dreams from the Witch House: Female Voices of Lovecraftian Horror Illustrated by Daniele Serra from the Publisher of World War Cthulhu: A Collection of Lovecraftian War Stories 

The history of the Old World is shrouded in secrecy. Creatures and forces unimaginable inhabited this realm for eons, long before any human navigated the surface of the earth.  As the Old Ones have slumbered or observed from afar, humans have assembled civilization upon this fragile planet. Yet the whispers from the elders have been growing stronger, their energy once again seeping into the world. These whispers are being felt throughout the earth; from the roots of our flora to the dreams of our children.  They are preparing us for what is to come.
In Dreams from the Witch House: Female Voices of Lovecraftian Horror the most intuitive dreamers have been assembled to give us glimpses into these ancient terrors and their whispered warnings. Featuring authors Joyce Carol Oates, Caitlín R. Kiernan, Lois Gresh, Gemma Files, Nancy Kilpatrick, Elizabeth Bear, Storm Constantine and others accompanied by the lavish artwork of Daniele Serra, Dreams from the Witch House: Female Voices of Lovecraftian Horror is a representation of some of the finest cosmic horror and weird fiction from female authors in the field today.

Dreams from the Witch House: Female Voices of Lovecraftian Horror has the potential to be expanded far beyond its originally planned production. This campaign (if successful) will enable us to commission award-winning artist Daniele Serra to create multiple new original artworks for the book and acquire more stories. This campaign should be considered an interactive preorder; not only are you securing your campaign-exclusive edition of Dark Regions Weird Fiction #2: Dreams from the Witch House: Female Voices of Lovecraftian Horror, you are also contributing to the success and possible expansion of the project itself.


If you have any questions during the campaign please do not message us on Indiegogo but instead e-mail us at: dreamsdrp@gmail.com

Thank you for your support of Dreams from the Witch House: Female Voices of Lovecraftian Horror.

Elizabeth Bear


Elizabeth Bear was born on the same day as Frodo and Bilbo Baggins, but in a different year. This, coupled with a childhood tendency to read the dictionary for fun, led her inevitably to penury, intransigence, the mispronunciation of common English words, and the writing of speculative fiction.

Katherine Addison is the pseudonym of Sarah Monette. She grew up in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, one of the three secret cities of the Manhattan Project, and now lives in a 108-year-old house in the Upper Midwest with a great many books, two cats, one grand piano, and one husband.

She has published more than fifty short stories, two novels (A Companion to Wolves, Tor Books, 2007, The Tempering of Men, Tor Books, 2011) and four short stories with Elizabeth Bear, and hopes to write more.

Her latest novel, The Goblin Emperor, published under the pen name Katherine Addison, came out from Tor in April 2014.

My name is David Thorpe, and I've been writing about music for more than ten years. I'm proud of my accomplishments as a writer, but I think we can all agree that it's time for me to shut up. 
If this campaign is successful, I will stop writing about music. I may stop tweeting or expressing any opinions via social media. Maybe I will stop talking about music out loud in public.
And who knows: if this thing goes through the roof, maybe I'll shut up about everything, forever.   Put Your Money Where My Mouth Is What I want is simple: to be paid to not write.   Writing is hard. I'm not very good at it. A lot of people, for a variety of really good reasons, think I should probably shut up.    The Impact If certain funding goals are reached, I will shut up in a series of escalating ways. But the bottom line is that the more money I get, the more fully I will shut up.
Imagine this:



You will not know my opinions on various developments in the music industry and the world of pop music.


If a new song comes out and I don't like it, you won't hear about that.


Maybe I won't tweet about the lost mid-80s David Lindley album ""Mr. Dave"" anymore.

I will never write a ""thinkpiece"" about anything.
If, hypothetically, I really like the new War On Drugs album, you will never even know.
I won't have to pretend to care about the latest surprise-release pop album that shakes up the music writing world for 2 hours.

The basic funding level requested ($184,000) will stop me from writing anything about music ever again, in any format.
    Risks & Challenges I'll admit that this is a strange proposition. There are several risks:  Maybe I won't make enough money and nothing will happen. Maybe I'll make a ton of money but decide that I shouldn't shut up anyway, because as a white male I have been conditioned by society to think everyone wants to hear my shitty opinions about everything.

<p></p></span></span></div>","“At its best, in [Jorge Luis]
Borges, Ray Bradbury and Edgar Allan Poe, the short story is coined from
precious metal, a glint of gold that will glow forever in the deep purse of
your imagination.”
—J. G. Ballard
WHAT IS THE MONKEY'S OTHER PAW? 
The idea behind THE MONKEY'S OTHER PAW has never been done before in an anthology format – Make a list of the greatest classic horror stories of all time and have modern authors create sequels, prequels, homages and re-imaginings. Among the stories selected are: ""The Monkey's Paw,"" H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Call of Cthulhu,"" Dylan Thomas' ghost story ""The Followers,"" E.T.A. Hoffmann's ""The Sandman,"" Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,"" and Saki's ""The Open Window."" Of course we also have Poe – in this case his unfinished story ""The Lighthouse"" is at last complete to horrific effect. We also have a graphic story letting us know what became of the Dorian Grey painting after the death of its subject.

PARTIAL TABLE OF CONTENTS:




Richard Nixon Saved From Drowning, and The Terminal Villa — Barry Malzberg (two pastiches inspired by J. G. Ballard’s “Terminal Beach”)


The Doom that Came to Devil’s Reef — Don Webb (Alternate POV story based on H.P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos)


Eddie the Great — Steve Rasnic Tem (updates Jekyll/Hyde)


The Monkey's Other Paw — Alegría Luna Luz  (gives us the aftermath of the classic horror tale)


A True Blue Bouquet — Ivan Fante (A sequel to Octavio Pax “The Blue Bouquet”)


Ghostless — Paul Di Filippo (Riffs on Dylan Thomas's ghost story “The Followers”)


The Alighted House — Alegría Luna Luz and Edgar Allan Poe (Poe’s unfinished fragment is only the beginning)


The Unheimlich Maneuver — Damien Broderick (Introduces Freud into Hoffmann’s “The Sandman”)


Footfall — Gay Partington Terry (A Kafka homage)


The Gallery of Dorian Grey — Martos


A Most Extraordinary Man — Scott Edelman  (A “switcheroo” of the plot in Saki’s “The Open Window”)











WHERE THE MONEY GOES 
We're asking for backing for THE MONKEY'S OTHER PAW to pay for prepress and production costs.  Most of the stories are already in hand. You can think of this campaign as pre-ordering the book. 
WHY PRE-ORDER?
More money goes to the creators and not to intermediates (like that gigantic mail-order retailer named after a river) that add nothing of substance to the project. We anticipate that the book will be ready to ship very soon after the completion of the fundraiser. Books will be printed in the USA.






If you can't help with funding you can still help by spreading the word. 


Alternate limited edition letterpress dust jacket for hardcover, signed by designer and editor. Exclusively for Indiegogo backers.



Limited pine box ""coffin"" edition with monkey's paw.

<p>It has always been our dream to be authors and help children throughout the world embrace who they are and become their best self. We have always been taught by our mom to love ourselves as we are and many other children do not know this value. Because we have this knowledge, we decided we want to share it!</p>
<p>Statistics in the U. S. show that 75% of boys and girls with low self-esteem are reported doing (or participating in) harmful and scary activities. </p>
<p>With your help, we can teach kids to fall in love with themselves, have self-belief, give back, take care of themselves, choose wisely for their future, and expand their growth. </p>

It has always been our dream to be authors and help children throughout the world embrace who they are and become their best self. We have always been taught by our mom to love ourselves as we are and many other children do not know this value. Because we have this knowledge, we decided we want to share it!
Statistics in the U. S. show that 75% of boys and girls with low self-esteem are reported doing (or participating in) harmful and scary activities. 
With your help, we can teach kids to fall in love with themselves, have self-belief, give back, take care of themselves, choose wisely for their future, and expand their growth. 
We have the book manuscript written and the illustrations drawn, we just need your donation to help raise our goal of $1,500 in 60 days to cover publishing costs and make our dream come true!

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have been writing songs for a very long time.  People have often asked me to share my lyrics in poetry form and it got me thinking that perhaps the poetry I write would also have some value. I would hope that my words could comfort, heal and get people thinking.  It's a collection of my life and thoughts.  I'm proud to be able to share it.  <br/></p>

<h3>The Stories We Tell: Survivor Testimonial Workshop</h3>
<p>Hi! We are Emily Bergl, Christa Desir, and Clare Gagne. We are three members of The Voices and Faces Project, a documentary project giving voice and face to survivors of sexual violence. We are looking to fund a writing workshop in New York City called ""The Stories We Tell"" for survivors of sexual violence, domestic violence, and sexual trafficking. </p>
<p><br/>This one-of-a-kind writing workshop provides survivors a two-day opportunity to learn and use the power of their own testimony to write and speak out about the violence they have lived through. <strong>Survivors pay no money for this workshop, it will be funded completely from the generosity of donors.</strong> </p>
This workshop has already travelled to more than five North American cities and many more have requested it. This workshop will cost $15,000 for twenty survivors over two full days. Those costs include workshop space, food and beverages, reading materials, and presenter travel and fees. So every $750 we receive will fully fund one participant. Again, survivor participants pay nothing. Your gift matters - sexual violence, domestic violence and trafficking are issues that affect women and men from every walk of life, and every race and creed - and often the survivors most in need of programs like ours can least afford them</div>
<p>And for every donation over $40, we will send you a CD created solely for the Voices &amp; Faces Project by artists such as Neeko Case, Joseph Arthur, &amp; The New Pornographers who care as deeply about this cause as we do. </p>
<p>We are grateful for every dollar you donate. We are equally grateful for you sharing the message about this campaign. Please let your friends and family know. And if you want to learn more about The Voices and Faces Project, you can check us out at: <a href=""http://www.voicesandfaces.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.voicesandfaces.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I thought to myself: Can I create something distinctly northern Californian?</p>
<p>Well this is it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short fiction, poetry, and nonfiction about northern California, written by northern Californians </li>
<li>This Indiegogo is to help bring the project to fruition</li>
<li>Contributing to this Indiegogo goes miles in making sure I can distribute this far and wide, and be able to represent our region with a professional publication</li>
<li>I have accepted submissions from great writers in the area, including fiction writer and professor Rob Davidson and local poet Lara Gularte</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>The money is earmarked specifically for printing and shipping</li>
<li>Our perks range from free digital and print copies to discounted ad rates</li>
<li>What we make goes to printing and shipping. In order for me (and my contributing editors) to make any money, we would have to go way over budget. This Indiegogo is for printing and publishing costs, plain and simple </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Making a contribution goes a long way in showing that I was right in thinking that northern California would like a regional, quarterly publication that features northern California writers:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think that this project has value to writers in the North State, as well as every citizen. It is a professional publication of which we can be proud </li>
<li>I have a lot of experience with publishing books, and I was the senior editor at a magazine. Putting out a quarterly anthology is something that I know will be easy for me to do</li>
<li>If you want to submit or learn about this project, please email me (Dan) at amalgamconsulting@gmail.com. I would love to hear from you!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that many people will not be able to contribute financially, but there are a number of ways that you can still help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>Let people know that we are accepting submissions for the inaugural issue until November 1st.</li>
<li>Let businesses know that we are accepting advertising to subsidize publishing and printing costs. </li>

It is a not-for-profit, cutting edge 21st century online journal encompassing all the genres of writing, and inculding spoken word, literary photography, visual arts, book history, and the occasional scholarship. MTLS was launched in 2008 to publish new, mid-career or established culturally and ethnically diverse Canadian writers and artists. It has some 10 percent international representation. MTLS began paying contributors token honoraria in 2009, but the editorial board, including myself, has been and still is made up of volunteers who have been contributing to funding the project. </p>

<li>Your support will help us in our long term goal of internationalising and enabling literary and artistic self-expression  and empathy that will contribute towards intercultural communications among peoples, groups, and cultures, and help alleviate feelings of alienation which encourages violence around the world.
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>To reach this long-term goal, we need you to help us become and remain a platform for liberal publishing of multiracial, multicultural, multi-faith, and international expressions of individual and cultural-group experiences.This is important because there is an ever increasing wave of violence in the world. Your support will help this project affect minds in a positive and compassionate manner towards mutual inter-cultural/ inter-group understanding in a world of full of variety and difference.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need an initial USD 75,000 dollatrs as endowment.</p>
<p class=""_mce_tagged_br""> </p>
<p>MTLS website must be re-developed for better navigation, a more dynamic architecture, and for increased, stable, and secure interactivity. We want to pay better honoraria to more writers and artists, to our volunteers, initiate e-commerce, and acquire stable infrastructure. In other words we need to create an arts endowment in other to ensure a sustainable operation funds and a continuous project with long-term goals and impact. We ask you to help us in our vision of increased global peace by contributing to this arts project.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We have a gift for all donors. Under a new website menu to be called the Express-for-Peace we will publish our supporters’ stories, poetry, random thoughts, artworks, video clips or inspirational writing or arts with your name and bio if you dont mind.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our dream is simple and beautiful.  For example a story, painting, spoken word by a gay male or female might begin to resonate with and allow a Muslim male or female of heterosexual orientation to understand or appreciate things from the other person’s experience of a phenomenon; or a scientific essay might be able to provide information which explains differences in sexual orientation as natural and normal. The virtual nature of these cross-cultural encounters will encourage respectful thought. We have been successful so far at a Canadian level.

 of creative speech is one of our primary focuses. Most traditional 
publishers have restrictions on content in ways that have limited the

limit content either to avoid ""offending"" potential customers or because
 of personal objections to the material. Instead of these approaches, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">
ForbiddenFiction.com</span> will use content labels (like ingredient labels on

some challenges in creating the business environment, which will not

that we will need to be ready to stand our ground if the rights of our 
authors, readers, and publishing team are challenged.<br/><br/>To
 put it simply, we need to make sure that all of the legal, bureaucratic
 and other documentation is in place if we run into a legal challenge. 
We need a lawyer who will set up our documents to avoid any loopholes 
that could be used to shut us down and be on retainer to meet any legal 
challenges. The estimated cost of the set-up paperwork alone is five to

authors, readers, and publishing team are challenged.To
 put it simply, we need to make sure that all of the legal, bureaucratic
 and other documentation is in place if we run into a legal challenge. 
We need a lawyer who will set up our documents to avoid any loopholes 
that could be used to shut us down and be on retainer to meet any legal 
challenges. The estimated cost of the set-up paperwork alone is five to 
ten thousand dollars. Then we will need all the filing fees and usual 
start up costs for a website publishing venture.What we offer:We
 will offer choices in reading and we offer choices in ways to help us. 
No matter which level of support you can offer (from a Menage a trois for $3 through the Mutual Benefits at $69 to the Noble Guardian of Free Speech
 at $2500), we have packages of perks including access to reading some 
of the most amazing erotic fiction as well as toys to play with. Thanks to our wonderful supporters at FirebirdFloggers.com.)Read through the list of perks! Check back as the campaign progresses to see what new options we come up with! If you have items you’d like to donate to make additional, let us know. Help spread the word:Whether
 you can make a financial contribution or not, we ask you to spread the

<p><em>Whippersnappers</em> is a non-profit, student-run, organization that works to bring first-rate literature to children of the Boston area. In the spring of 2012, a group of students came together with an idea to create an anthology for children, comprised of short stories, poetry, and illustrations, that they felt captured the complexity and the magic of being a child. After assembling a team and working relentlessly to market and promote the publication, the <em>Whippersnappers</em> team is proud to say we've received an overwhelming amount of support from the writing and publishing community as well as a wide collection of superb submissions. <br/><br/> The anthology will be printed by late April and distributed to as many schools, libraries, and day care centers as we possibly can reach. With the ever-continuing battle against illiteracy in the Boston area and beyond, we hope to provide a tool to instill the love of reading and learning to the young and the young-at-heart.</p>
<p>The next step is where we need YOU! In order to make this dream a reality, we need the help and support of everyone who can!<br/><br/> We want to raise at least $3,000 to cover the costs of printing our book. Every last cent you donate will go directly towards the printing process. The more money we raise, the more copies we print, and the more copies we print, the more Boston children can read these excellent stories.</p>
<p>So we are asking for your help in any way you can. Whether you have $2.50 in change on your desk or $250 you've been waiting to spend on a special project like this, please donate. We will be truly grateful.<br/><br/> If you can’t donate, there are still plenty of ways to help this great organization! Help spread the word of <em>Whippersnappers</em> in your local community.

<p><strong><br/><br/>Hi!</strong> About a year ago i started collecting cute crochet patterns on my website called <a href=""http://www.amigurumipatterns.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">amigurumipatterns.net</a>. In the past year these patterns have been consulted from all over the world and created many smiling faces, from grandchildren to colleagues, no one can resist the cuteness of amigurumi.<br/><br/>As the site kept on growing, a little idea grew along... All these designers on my website make amazing work, they're so good at what they're doing, i think they deserve to be published. And i wasn't the only one thinking this, many of you seemed to like the idea.<br/><br/>Encouraged by all of you i started collecting patterns that are irresistibly cute and unseen unique.

<p><strong>WHAT'S AMIGURUMI?</strong><br/>Amigurumi is the Japanese art of crocheting small stuffed animals. The word is derived from a combination of the Japanese words ami, meaning crocheted or knitted, and nuigurumi, meaning stuffed doll. Amigurumi must be the most fun way to use a crochet hook, with just a little practice you'll make all these amazing designs in a jiffy. If you're not familiar with the techniques, then don't worry. The book will have a few pages explaining all the basics (both in drawings and text) so you won't get lost reading your first pattern.<br/><br/><strong><img alt=""piglet and pony"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://amigurumipatterns.net/images/indiegogo3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT WILL IT LOOK LIKE?</strong><br/><strong><em>The book:</em></strong> It will be a soft cover book of 72 pages in full colour including large pictures and clear written out instructions of all the amigurumi you want to make. There will be basic crochet tutorials for those who take their first steps in amigurumi world. <br/>I've gathered 15 cute animal patterns: Levi the baby Bear, Reco the pig, Zico the Toucan, Tara the Cat, little Tiger, Leila the pony, Johnny the Monkey, Lil Quack the duck, Sartù the Lemur, Bernard the fox, Dakota the dog, Eduardo the donkey, Morton the Moose, naughty mice and Wasabi the bunny <em>(Pictures are available using the tab above)</em> <br/><br/><em><strong>e-book:</strong> </em>The e-book is included in any of the perks.

It will have a print of an alter ego of every amigurumi character in the book. The bag will be 42x38cm (16,5x15 inches) with comfortable long handles.</p>

</div></div>","Too Much Screen Time Is Impeding Childhood Development
Our children sit in front of screens all day - TV, PC, tablet or smartphone. And it affects their development.

We want to create a book and a community that will make them more active, encouraging them to enjoy the physical world. 
By helping us out, you can be a part of it too.
The Book
Written for a 4-9 year-old audience, Planet Earth Kids Club tells the story of Tom, who lives in Compupiter - a planet where life happens through the screens.  



School is virtual, friends are met via the screen, and even the museum is yet another website to visit...


One day Tom finds out about planet Earth. He then decides to start a Kids Club - with the help of his grandma - and turn Compupiter into a lively and green planet. Join Tom on his magical journey!





The Community


But reading a book is sometimes not enough - we want the kids to get up, grab mom and/or dad, and go outside. Outside the screens. So we created a community where every kid can join the club, by actually doing activities in the physical world.




In order to join the club, the kid needs to do the activities. The kids can then send us pictures of themselves doing the activities, and we will publish it on our website, including their name and the ranks they earned.




What can you get?

Besides helping us making this important movement, you could get wonderful rewards.A selection of cool rewards is available on the right section of this webpage. To name but a few:

<h2>Who doesn't love a crazy monkey?!</h2>
<p><em>Big Pulp</em> does. We love monkeys almost as much as we love a good story. A good story <em>about</em> monkeys? That's about the best thing ever! 20 of them in one book? Well, we just died and went to Heaven. </p>
<h3>About Big Pulp</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We're carving out an independent corner of the publishing world where story matters and writers get paid for their work. Got 20 bucks? You can help us out in a big way. </p>
<p>Since 2008,<em> <a href=""http://bigpulp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"" title=""Big Pulp"">Big Pulp</a> </em>has published some of the best genre fiction writers from around the world. Our zine is a modern version of the classic corner newsstand, where writers and readers could find pulp and popular fiction of all kinds - science fiction, adventure stories, horror, fantasy, jungle tales, mystery and true crime, romance, and super-hero sagas. <em>Big Pulp</em> has published long-time writers and award-winners, as well as new and emerging authors. Some of our writers have published hundreds of stories or poems, but many have received their first writing credit - and first payment - from <em>Big Pulp</em>. </p>
<div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Sales are our lifeline. Period. Without sales, we would no longer be able to pay our writers, maintain our website or continue publishing. </p>
<p>We strongly believe that <strong>writers deserve to be paid for their work</strong>. We also believe that offering payment significantly increases the quality of work that is submitted to us for publication on our site and in the magazine. </p>
<p><em>Big Pulp</em> launched online in 2008, moved into print in 2010. This year, we're adding themed anthologies to our publications. We're no fly-by-night or vanity press! We've been at this a while and want your support to keep it going! </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>$2500 buys a lot for a small press, including dozens of writer payments and a healthy print run for several books. </p>
<p>All our editorial work - site maintenance, editing and proofreading, sales &amp; events - is done <em>pro bono</em>. Every dollar raised through the campaign will go back into running the site, publishing the magazine, and paying contributors. No exceptions. </p>
<p>We're not asking for you to give something for nothing! Depending on your funding level, you net a copy of <em>Big Pulp</em>, back issues, a copy of our monkey-themed story collection <em>APESHIT</em>, an awesome hand-crafted <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/398593976840833/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Jankie</em> by Phil Good</a>, an original sketch by comic artist Ken Knudtsen (<em>Wolverine</em>, <em>My Monkey's Name is Jennifer</em>), a thorough manuscript critique by <em>Big Pulp</em> editor Bill Olver, or a massive combo pack! Trust us - they are all awesome. </p>

<p><br/><strong>The Project</strong><br/><br/>A few years back I wrote a short story, “A Puddle of Blood,” which was published in the vampire anthology <em>Evolve 2</em>. It was about Domingo and Atl, a teenager and a vampire in Mexico City. The story was reprinted <em>Imaginarium 2012: The Best Canadian Speculative Writing</em>.<br/><br/>Afterwards, I began toying with expanding it and making a YA novel out of it. Why? Isn't that what all the cool cats are doing? I want to write something that is a bit noir, a bit vampires, and a bit Mexico. </p>
<p>I decided to fund this through IndieGoGo after I applied for a small Canada Arts Grant and was denied. I also had a scary medical MRI which convinced me I don't have forever to finish stuff. Both of these events propelled me forward.<br/><br/><em>Below, Alex, illustration by <em><a href=""http://comicalchemy.blogspot.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GMB Chomichuk</a></em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been writing since 2006. My work has appeared in a bunch of anthologies from small and big publishers alike. My first collection, <em>This Strange Way of Dying</em>, is out this year from Canadian lit publisher Exile Editions. <br/><br/>I own my own micro publishing company (Innsmouth Free Press) and I figured maybe I should try to publish this by myself. Hey, why not? After all, I've edited and published other books before.</p>
<p>I intend to deliver the final novel by November 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Where is my money going to?</strong></p>
<p>Production (copy-editing and the like), <span class=""st"">commissioning</span> a cover (the artist will have to get paid), and most importantly, you buy me time to write. Without time I can't do this. This is why I had applied to a Canada Arts Grant in the first place. Time is money...well. You get the drift.</p>
<p><strong>What do I get?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your donation level anything from an e-book (no DRM), to a print (sexy paperback!) copy, to the book plus various pieces of swag.</p>
<p>If you donate $100 or more, you get a special chapbook containing four of my short stories. One of them will be completely new!</p>
<p>Or, also for $100, you get a short story critique.</p>
<p>At $150 I'll send you the book in hardcover, an exclusive IndieGoGo reward. It won't be available in this format elsewhere.</p>
<p>At $250, dinner is on me during next year's World Horror convention in Portland.</p>
<p>At $250 I'll write a story inspired by a title of your choice.</p>
<p>At $250 you can get an eerie Tentacle Stick.</p>
<p>At $350 you can have a custom ukulele.</p>
<p>At $500 purchase the Seven Snakes Guitar.</p>
<p>At $1,000 you get a Tuckerization and a secret vampiric gift.</p>

<h3>TEASER: Chapter 1</h3>
<p>Collecting garbage sharpens the senses. It allows one to notice what others do not see. Where most people spy a pile of junk, the rag-and-bone man sees treasure: empty bottles that might be taken to the recycling centre, computer innards which can be re-used, furniture in decent shape. The garbage collector is always looking. It is a profession.  </p>
<p>Domingo was always looking for garbage and he was always looking at people. It was his hobby. The people, not the garbage. He walked around Mexico City in his blue plastic jacket, head bobbed down, and while he tossed a bottle into a plastic bag he paused to observe the people eating at a restaurant. He looked at the maids as they got up early and purchased bread at the bakery. He saw the people in shiny cars zoom by and the people without any cash jump onto the back of the bus, hanging with their nails and their grit to the metallic shell of the moving vehicle.</p>
<p>Domingo had spent most of the day outside, pushing a shopping cart with his findings, and listening to his portable music player. It got dark and he bought himself dinner at a taco stand. Then it started to rain so he headed into the subway station.<br/>He spent a lot of time in the subway system. He used to sleep in the subway cars when he was a street kid making a living by washing windshields at cross streets.</p>
<p>Those days were behind. He had a place to sleep and lately he collected junk for an important rag-and-bone man, focusing on gathering used thermoplastic clothing for him. He complemented his income with other odd jobs, with the recycled bottles and the interesting items he fished from the garbage. Domingo was well-fed and he had enough money to buy tokens for the public baths once a week. <br/>He felt like he was really going places but entertainment was still out of his reach. He had his comic books and graphic novels to keep him company but most of the time, when he was bored, he watched people as they walked around the subway lines.</p>
<p>It was easy because few of them paid attention to the teenager leaning against the wall, backpack dangling from his left shoulder. He, on the other hand, paid attention to everything. He constructed lives for the people who shuffled in front of him. This one looked like a man who worked selling life insurance. That one was a secretary, but not with a good firm because her shoes looked cheap. Here came a con artist and there went a lovelorn housewife.</p>
<p>Domingo imagined names and biographies for them as he leaned against the cool wall tiles and bobbed his head to the sound of the music. It was Michael Jackson for the day.</p>
<p>After an hour of people watching, Domingo went to look at the large TV screens in the concourse. There were six of them, all showing different shows. Domingo spent fifteen minutes staring at Japanese music videos, then he switched to the news.   </p>
<p><em>Six dismembered bodies found in Ciudad Juarez. Vampire drug-wars rage on.</em></p>
<p>Domingo read the headline slowly. Images flashed on the video screen of the subway station. Cops. Long shots of the bodies. The images dissolved, showing a young woman holding a can of soda in her hands. She winked at him.</p>
<p>Domingo waited to see if the next news items would expand on the drug-war story. He was fond of yellow journalism. He also liked stories and comic books about vampires; they seemed exotic. There were no vampires in Mexico City: their kind had been a no-no for the past thirty years, around the time the Federal District became a city-state.</p>
<p>The next story was of a pop-star, the singing sensation of the month, and then there was another ad, this one for a shoulder-bag computer. Domingo sulked, changed the tune on his music player.</p>
<p>He looked at another screen with pictures of blue butterflies fluttering around. Domingo took a chocolate from his pocket and tore the wrapper.</p>
<p>He wondered if he shouldn’t head to Santino’s party. Santino lived in a vecindad downtown and though his home was a one-bedroom, they were throwing an all-night party on the roof where there was plenty of space. But Santino was friends with El Chacal and Domingo didn’t want to see that guy. Besides, he’d probably have to contribute to the beer budget. It was the end of the month. Domingo was short on cash.</p>
<p>Domingo pondered his options.</p>
<p>A woman wearing a black vinyl jacket walked by him, holding a leash. Her Doberman must have been genetically modified. The animal was huge and looked mean. <br/>Domingo recognized her. He’d seen her twice before, riding the subway late at nights, always with the dog. Heavy boots upon the white tiles, bob cut black hair, with a regal stance and a sharp, aquiline face. The way she moved, it made him think of water. Like she was sliding on water.</p>
<p>She moved her face a small fraction, glancing at him. It was nothing but a glance, but the way she did it made Domingo feel like he’d been doused with a bucket of ice water. Something bored into him, snaked around his throat, and he felt the need to follow her.</p>
<p>Domingo stuffed the remaining chocolate back in his pocket, took off his headphones and walked behind her quickly, squeezing through the doors of the subway car she was boarding.</p>
<p>He sat across from her and was able to get a better look at the woman. She was older than him, early twenties, with large eyes that gave her an air of innocence which was quickly dispelled by the stern mouth. The woman was cute, in an odd way.  </p>
<p>He noticed her gloves.  Black vinyl which matched the jacket. She wasn’t wearing a fancy outfit but there was definitely something special about it. He suspected it was more expensive that it seemed.</p>
<p>The subway car stopped and Domingo fidgeted, wondering where she was headed. The woman patted the dog’s head.</p>
<p>He was looking at her discreetly and he knew how to do discreet, so he was a bit surprised when she turned and stared right back at him.</p>
<p>Domingo froze and swallowed. He found his tongue with some effort.</p>
<p>“Hey,” he said, smiling. “How are you doing tonight?”</p>
<p>She did not smile back. Her lips were pressed together in a precise and unyielding line. He hoped she wasn’t thinking of letting the dog loose on him for staring at her.</p>
<p>The subway car was almost deserted and when she spoke her voice seemed to echo around them even though she spoke very softly.</p>
<p>“Should you be out by yourself at this time of the night?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“How old are you?”</p>
<p>“Seventeen,” he replied, lying only by two months. “It’s early. It’s just before midnight.”</p>
<p>“No curfew?”</p>
<p>“No,” he scoffed. “I live on my own.”</p>
<p>“Ah, a man about town.”</p>
<p>There was laughter in her voice even though she didn’t laugh. It made him stand up and he was ready to push his little shopping cart away, to leave her alone. She turned her head away from him and he assumed this was goodbye. Goodnight.</p>
<p>“I’m looking for a friend,” she said unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Domingo blinked. He nodded, uncertain.</p>

The ProjectA few years back I wrote a short story, “A Puddle of Blood,” which was published in the vampire anthology Evolve 2. It was about Domingo and Atl, a teenager and a vampire in Mexico City. The story was reprinted Imaginarium 2012: The Best Canadian Speculative Writing.Afterwards, I began toying with expanding it and making a YA novel out of it. Why? Isn't that what all the cool cats are doing? I want to write something that is a bit noir, a bit vampires, and a bit Mexico. 
I decided to fund this through IndieGoGo after I applied for a small Canada Arts Grant and was denied. I also had a scary medical MRI which convinced me I don't have forever to finish stuff. Both of these events propelled me forward.Below, Alex, illustration by GMB Chomichuk.

Risks and challenges
I’ve been writing since 2006. My work has appeared in a bunch of anthologies from small and big publishers alike. My first collection, This Strange Way of Dying, is out this year from Canadian lit publisher Exile Editions. I own my own micro publishing company (Innsmouth Free Press) and I figured maybe I should try to publish this by myself. Hey, why not? After all, I've edited and published other books before.
I intend to deliver the final novel by November 2014.
Where is my money going to?
Production (copy-editing and the like), commissioning a cover (the artist will have to get paid), and most importantly, you buy me time to write. Without time I can't do this. This is why I had applied to a Canada Arts Grant in the first place. Time is money...well. You get the drift.
What do I get?
Depending on your donation level anything from an e-book (no DRM), to a print (sexy paperback!) copy, to the book plus various pieces of swag.
If you donate $100 or more, you get a special chapbook containing four of my short stories. One of them will be completely new!
Or, also for $100, you get a short story critique.
At $150 I'll send you the book in hardcover, an exclusive IndieGoGo reward. It won't be available in this format elsewhere.
At $250, dinner is on me during next year's World Horror convention in Portland.
At $250 I'll write a story inspired by a title of your choice.
At $250 you can get an eerie Tentacle Stick.
At $350 you can have a custom ukulele.
At $500 purchase the Seven Snakes Guitar.
At $1,000 you get a Tuckerization and a secret vampiric gift.
Come on, support it!

TEASER: Chapter 1
Collecting garbage sharpens the senses. It allows one to notice what others do not see. Where most people spy a pile of junk, the rag-and-bone man sees treasure: empty bottles that might be taken to the recycling centre, computer innards which can be re-used, furniture in decent shape. The garbage collector is always looking. It is a profession.  
Domingo was always looking for garbage and he was always looking at people. It was his hobby. The people, not the garbage. He walked around Mexico City in his blue plastic jacket, head bobbed down, and while he tossed a bottle into a plastic bag he paused to observe the people eating at a restaurant. He looked at the maids as they got up early and purchased bread at the bakery. He saw the people in shiny cars zoom by and the people without any cash jump onto the back of the bus, hanging with their nails and their grit to the metallic shell of the moving vehicle.
Domingo had spent most of the day outside, pushing a shopping cart with his findings, and listening to his portable music player. It got dark and he bought himself dinner at a taco stand. Then it started to rain so he headed into the subway station.He spent a lot of time in the subway system. He used to sleep in the subway cars when he was a street kid making a living by washing windshields at cross streets.
Those days were behind. He had a place to sleep and lately he collected junk for an important rag-and-bone man, focusing on gathering used thermoplastic clothing for him. He complemented his income with other odd jobs, with the recycled bottles and the interesting items he fished from the garbage. Domingo was well-fed and he had enough money to buy tokens for the public baths once a week. He felt like he was really going places but entertainment was still out of his reach. He had his comic books and graphic novels to keep him company but most of the time, when he was bored, he watched people as they walked around the subway lines.
It was easy because few of them paid attention to the teenager leaning against the wall, backpack dangling from his left shoulder. He, on the other hand, paid attention to everything. He constructed lives for the people who shuffled in front of him. This one looked like a man who worked selling life insurance. That one was a secretary, but not with a good firm because her shoes looked cheap. Here came a con artist and there went a lovelorn housewife.
Domingo imagined names and biographies for them as he leaned against the cool wall tiles and bobbed his head to the sound of the music. It was Michael Jackson for the day.
After an hour of people watching, Domingo went to look at the large TV screens in the concourse. There were six of them, all showing different shows. Domingo spent fifteen minutes staring at Japanese music videos, then he switched to the news.   
Six dismembered bodies found in Ciudad Juarez. Vampire drug-wars rage on.
Domingo read the headline slowly. Images flashed on the video screen of the subway station. Cops. Long shots of the bodies. The images dissolved, showing a young woman holding a can of soda in her hands. She winked at him.
Domingo waited to see if the next news items would expand on the drug-war story. He was fond of yellow journalism. He also liked stories and comic books about vampires; they seemed exotic. There were no vampires in Mexico City: their kind had been a no-no for the past thirty years, around the time the Federal District became a city-state.
The next story was of a pop-star, the singing sensation of the month, and then there was another ad, this one for a shoulder-bag computer. Domingo sulked, changed the tune on his music player.
He looked at another screen with pictures of blue butterflies fluttering around. Domingo took a chocolate from his pocket and tore the wrapper.
He wondered if he shouldn’t head to Santino’s party. Santino lived in a vecindad downtown and though his home was a one-bedroom, they were throwing an all-night party on the roof where there was plenty of space. But Santino was friends with El Chacal and Domingo didn’t want to see that guy. Besides, he’d probably have to contribute to the beer budget. It was the end of the month. Domingo was short on cash.
Domingo pondered his options.
A woman wearing a black vinyl jacket walked by him, holding a leash. Her Doberman must have been genetically modified. The animal was huge and looked mean. Domingo recognized her. He’d seen her twice before, riding the subway late at nights, always with the dog. Heavy boots upon the white tiles, bob cut black hair, with a regal stance and a sharp, aquiline face. The way she moved, it made him think of water. Like she was sliding on water.
She moved her face a small fraction, glancing at him. It was nothing but a glance, but the way she did it made Domingo feel like he’d been doused with a bucket of ice water. Something bored into him, snaked around his throat, and he felt the need to follow her.
Domingo stuffed the remaining chocolate back in his pocket, took off his headphones and walked behind her quickly, squeezing through the doors of the subway car she was boarding.
He sat across from her and was able to get a better look at the woman. She was older than him, early twenties, with large eyes that gave her an air of innocence which was quickly dispelled by the stern mouth. The woman was cute, in an odd way.  
He noticed her gloves.  Black vinyl which matched the jacket. She wasn’t wearing a fancy outfit but there was definitely something special about it. He suspected it was more expensive that it seemed.
The subway car stopped and Domingo fidgeted, wondering where she was headed. The woman patted the dog’s head.
He was looking at her discreetly and he knew how to do discreet, so he was a bit surprised when she turned and stared right back at him.
Domingo froze and swallowed. He found his tongue with some effort.
“Hey,” he said, smiling. “How are you doing tonight?”
She did not smile back. Her lips were pressed together in a precise and unyielding line. He hoped she wasn’t thinking of letting the dog loose on him for staring at her.
The subway car was almost deserted and when she spoke her voice seemed to echo around them even though she spoke very softly.
“Should you be out by yourself at this time of the night?”
“What do you mean?”
“How old are you?”
“Seventeen,” he replied, lying only by two months. “It’s early. It’s just before midnight.”
“No curfew?”
“No,” he scoffed. “I live on my own.”
“Ah, a man about town.”
There was laughter in her voice even though she didn’t laugh. It made him stand up and he was ready to push his little shopping cart away, to leave her alone. She turned her head away from him and he assumed this was goodbye. Goodnight.
“I’m looking for a friend,” she said unexpectedly.
Domingo blinked. He nodded, uncertain.

What I Need
I need to raise $8,000 to help pay to design, edit, print and market my book. I plan to release it February of next year.

<h1>Independent Bookstores of America</h1>
<p><em>Independent Bookstores of America </em>is a coffee table book featuring locally owned, independent bookstores in cities throughout each of the contiguous 48 United States of America. The book is an attempt to chronicle a slice of American life that many people believe is in danger of disappearing. The book will feature pictures of thriving, locally owned bookstores and include a little information describing each store’s unique story.</p>
<p>This idea has evolved as a product of my passion for books, reading, and supporting locally owned businesses. In the book there will be a page filled with information about how and what each person can do to support their local independent bookstore even if they are a consumer of e-books. The use of an e-reader does not have to mean the end of the local community bookstore! Bookstores serve as an integral part of our society and have been a hub for community building for centuries. While the large chain bookstores may be facing problems, local independent stores are making a come back in many cities as we remember the value of having a bookstore where we can mix and mingle and be!</p>
<h1><strong>Why I am doing this project </strong></h1>
<p>I'm doing this project for one simple reason; I love bookstores. I also hold a bachelor's and master's degree in political science and believe in the benefits of supporting locally owned businesses. I believe bookstores are one of the few places we have left that can promote civic engagement and community building. But most importantly, I am doing this because project because of what bookstores have meant to me over the years. </p>
<p>This is a project of passion for me. I moved around a lot as a child, and bookstores were my constant refuge. The first thing I did when I moved to a new place was to seek out the closet bookstore. My hope is that this book will capture the feeling all book lovers get when they first walk into a store.</p>
<h1>Why I am the best possible person to write and produce this book</h1>
<div>
<p>If there’s one thing people who know me can tell you, it’s that I love books. There are many things in life that I may be undecided about, but the one thing that always remains constant about me is that I am an avid supporter and encourager of reading. I don’t care if you read the most erudite books or the trashiest of trash – all reading has benefits, and I support all of it! This is also why I started a website [<a href=""http://bookprescriber.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bookprescriber.org</a>] with the goal of helping people find books they will love  -- I believe non-readers are only a book away from becoming book lovers.</p>
<p>So, practically? I have spent the last six months planning the logistics needed to make this book happen. I have chosen stores in each state (most from local recommendations) along with backups in case of an unforeseen problem with the first chosen store. I have mapped routes, chosen cameras, software, and have other materials in place to start production on the book itself after returning from the stores. I have also worked with a really great lawyer to prepare a release for the stores to sign and have contingency plans in place for any problems I may run into while creating this book.</p>
<p>I estimate it will take nearly two months of traveling across America to complete this book. The money I raise will go to supporting travel, photography, interviews, writing, book design, proofreading, and ultimately, publishing the book both digitally and in hardcopy.</p>
<h1>What's next?</h1>
<div>
<p>There will be full transparency in the creation of this book because I will be keeping a blog as I travel to all the stores. You'll get updates, previews of material that will be in the book, and be able to keep tabs on where I am in the United States.</p>
<p>Another way to help out and support this project whether or not you can donate right now is to spread the word via Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, and your other social networks.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id=""risks"">
<p>One of the biggest challenges of this project is managing the logistics involved to get to each bookstore and be able to work with someone from each store. Since I am aware of the possible challenges, most of which can be overcome with more time, I am scheduling enough time and flexibility into my research to accommodate any unforeseen issues.</p>
<p>This book project is a dream of mine. It will be a once in a lifetime experience to pursue and create something I am personally very passionate about. I am determined to overcome any obstacles that may arise to complete this book!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support!!</p>

<h3>A Space Opera Classic in the Making</h3>
<p>Hey, my name is Dominic. I've written a space opera military action novel called <strong>SACRIFICE</strong>. It's the first in a trilogy of novels I've planned that show David Stern's journey from an eager upstart in the military to the greatest war hero of his time. It will be a long ride, but it's one you will enjoy.</p>
<p>In 2694, the human world is on the verge of great change. On the outskirts of the civilzed universe, a lonely patrol discovers a race of spacefaring aliens that leave many in the military fearing for the safety of the human race, but the aliens aren't the only thing that concerns the Human Defence League.</p>
<p>A dangerous terrorist known as Zeus has escaped from prison and ignited a revolution that left unchecked will spread into a civil war. With a potential threat from without and a very real threat from within, the League sends David Stern undercover to bring Zeus in: dead or alive.</p>
<p>David's been waiting his whole life for a mission like this, but his opponent is two steps ahead of him and slowly but surely pushing the galaxy into a war that only David can prevent.</p>
<p>David and his comrades race to track down and assassinate Zeus. The stakes are high and only getting higher and David has to choose what rules he must break in order to level the playing field and get the job done.</p>
<p>What will he sacrifice for the sake of his objective?</p>

</div></div>","A Space Opera Classic in the Making
Hey, my name is Dominic. I've written a space opera military action novel called SACRIFICE. It's the first in a trilogy of novels I've planned that show David Stern's journey from an eager upstart in the military to the greatest war hero of his time. It will be a long ride, but it's one you will enjoy.
In 2694, the human world is on the verge of great change. On the outskirts of the civilzed universe, a lonely patrol discovers a race of spacefaring aliens that leave many in the military fearing for the safety of the human race, but the aliens aren't the only thing that concerns the Human Defence League.
A dangerous terrorist known as Zeus has escaped from prison and ignited a revolution that left unchecked will spread into a civil war. With a potential threat from without and a very real threat from within, the League sends David Stern undercover to bring Zeus in: dead or alive.
David's been waiting his whole life for a mission like this, but his opponent is two steps ahead of him and slowly but surely pushing the galaxy into a war that only David can prevent.
David and his comrades race to track down and assassinate Zeus. The stakes are high and only getting higher and David has to choose what rules he must break in order to level the playing field and get the job done.
What will he sacrifice for the sake of his objective?
Download the first SEVEN CHAPTERS of Sacrifice here.
Give the preview a read and decide for yourself if this is a book you'd like to see spread to the world. I intend to embrace the ebook revolution and release Sacrifice as an ebook available at all major retailers including Apple, Amazon, Kobo, Sony, and Nook as well as in PDF.


What I Need & What You Get
This is a list of how I plan to use the money. My goal is based on quotes and projected rates that I've added up

Indiegogo fees + printing fees for the perks (about 30% of funds raised or $2100 based on the project meeting its goal)
Professional content editing and formatting ($1500)
Professional promotional art ($1000 - $1500)
Obtaining professional advance reviews (e.g. Kirkus, $850)
Copyright registration ($50)
Postage & supplies necessary to mail everything
Advertising, primarily using Facebook and Goodreads ($500)

If I don't reach my entire goal, I will use whatever I raise and put it towards the items of most pressing importance. I've listed them according to my priority level. I am already putting my own money into the project, and if I do not reach my goal I will just be delayed and have to spend more. However, I won't give up under any circumstance.
If I exceed my goal, the extra funds will be put into more advertising or art.
To help encourage your donations, I've included great rewards to go with every donation over 10 dollars. Of course, these perks have added significant costs to my fundraising goal, but I think it’s worth it to show the early adopters that your contributions matter and that your money will not only help me, but also get you something in return.

<p>My name is Crash Barry and I write about the seamy side of life in Maine. Perhaps you’re familiar with my rollicking novel <strong><em>Sex, Drugs and Blueberries</em></strong> or my gritty memoir <strong><em>Tough Island</em></strong>. Maybe you’ve read my column <em><strong>One Maniac’s Meat</strong></em> or my other work in <em><strong>the Bollard</strong></em> or you enjoyed the short-lived <em><strong>Crash Report </strong></em>in the <em><strong>Portland Daily Sun</strong></em>. Or maybe you just stumbled across this project because you liked the name <em><strong>Marijuana Valley</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I think we're curretly living in the best time in the history of the printed word to be an indie writer like myself. While some authors bemoan the collapse of the publishing industry, I think that in the Internet era, the future looks brightest for writers who embrace the new paradigm.</p>
<p>And one of the wonderful things about the new paradigm is the relationship between author and reader. Thanks to social media, email, blogs and my books and newspaper work, I feel I have a real relationship with the folks who read my what I write. And it’s been a great year traveling and meeting people at library and bookstore events across Maine as part of my <em><strong>Tough Island: Live</strong> </em>tour.</p>
<p>Which has given me the confidence to attempt to raise the money necessary to successfully print and promote my new book <em><strong>Marijuana Valley, Maine</strong></em> via crowdfunding and Indiegogo. The $12,000, or more,  that I hope to raise will be spent on the business side of publishing. While I'm very appreciative and proud of the sales of my first two books, it was a difficult struggle to find the cash to actually get the titles in print. Editing, design, advertizing, public relations and mailing all cost a lot of money. And by pre-selling copies of <strong><em>Marijuana Valley</em></strong>, I'll be able to handle the costs without much stress, thanks to my loyal readers.</p>
<p>In the forthcoming <strong><em>Marijuana Valley,</em></strong><em> </em>which I expect will be out around the start of 2013,<strong><em> </em></strong>I detail the trials and tribulations of several people –all who happened to live on the same road in rural Maine – as they grew medical marijuana, legally, during the summer of 2010. <strong><em>Marijuana Valley</em></strong> is a vivid, behind-the-scenes look at a tiny slice of the secretive subculture involved with Maine’s most valuable agricultural product.</p>
<p>For the duration of the campaign, I'll be regularly posting updates and special tips and tales related to marijuana and the cannabis subculture, much of which I learned during the last 18-months I've spent researching the topic of marijuana.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll tune in and I hope you'll support this project. And even if you can't help out financially, I'd really appreciate you sharing this details of this project -- and the accompanying film -- with friends and aquaintenances.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>The Caring Computer is a book on modern, everyday technologies that act as doctors combating the scariness of dementia, falling, heart failure, and other issues within seniors. This book explores the intersections of innovative healthy aging prototypes, entrepreneurial caregiving, and the presence of artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector.<br/><br/>My name is Martha Gizaw, and I am the author of The Caring Computer: Today’s Technologies that Serve as Doctors for the Aging Globe. I wrote this book because I believe a variety of technologies can help senior adults live up to their healthy lifestyles in the household. Families fear for the predictable, rapidly-growing “silver tsunami,” and they should consider our current technologies as modern-day solutions to the burdens of caring for their older relatives.<br/><br/>The Caring Computer is a non-fiction book that speaks to caregivers, engineers, and physicians who are looking at aging innovation and technological developments for the first time.<br/><br/>I hope that, in reading this book, you will discover the possibility of closing the gaps between bio-medicine and computing by improving seniors’ health and independence via technological innovation and entrepreneurship. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for aging innovation and technological developments in you. Ultimately, I want people to see this book as a tool to help us seek creative alternative ways to make a difference in the healthcare, research, and geriatric career sectors.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll learn about the accounts ranging from the significance and benefits of interdisciplinary thinking to the ability of voice-first devices to help users “age in place.” You’ll hear:</p>
<ul>
<li>How startups and organizations are working to bridge the separate worlds of science and technology;</li>
<li>What technical approaches are available to help relieve the symptoms of dementia and other problems associated with aging; and</li>
<li>How solutions leading to healthier aging can benefit future generations of seniors.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you have an innovative mindset and an interest in enacting positive change in the lives of others.</p>

<h3>The Book - <i>The Caring Computer: Today’s Technologies that Serve as Doctors for the Aging Globe</i>
</h3>
<p>The book contains three parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 “Battle of the Sciences” </strong>begins with a personal struggle to choose a career path based on either passion or marketability. More specifically, this part deals with comparisons between biomedical science and computing regarding learning preferences and career outlook, and how bridging the two subjects can give way to technologies that help make a difference in a global aging society.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 “Innovating for Dementia” </strong>covers stories that explain the technologies and scientific advancements currently available for entrepreneurial caregivers to look for symptoms and changes in memory and daily routines among dementia patients.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 “Tech-Savvy Attempts to Conquer Aging” </strong>features stories that promote the creation of devices and platforms, from gene-editing tools to mobile apps to AI analysis, that could assist seniors with activities of daily living. The book will then come to an exciting ending with voice-first robots that underwent beta testing on seniors, courtesy of Intuition Robotics and the Front Porch Center for Innovation and Wellbeing.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Martha Gizaw is a graduating student at the College of William &amp; Mary studying biomedical engineering and computer science. She is among a crowd of people from underrepresented backgrounds who hope to begin a STEM career after graduating college. Given that she was diagnosed with multiple disabilities, settling on a college major and career path was extremely difficult for her compared to other students. Originally a natural science enthusiast, Gizaw began taking computer science courses at age 20. With initial plans on studying neuroscience, she faced mixed reactions from family members and professors that urged her to step outside the comfort zone and solve challenging problems beyond her imagination.<br/><br/>Gizaw wrote this book because she has had a curiosity for science and an aptitude for technology and mathematics. While working hard on projects that combine those disciplines, she hopes to make a difference in others’ lives. Chatbots, mobile apps, smart homes, computer vision, and hardware electronics are currently in the market for people from newborns to super-centenarians. Gizaw also considers herself a techie with a dream of becoming a researcher or data scientist in the engineering industry to shape humanity with innovation and insightful statistics.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
By contributing according the perks on the top-right, you'll get the books you want to get. Everything is already included: shipping, handling, and extra care.

Risks & Challenges
I live in Russia. We love books here, and that's why I've started this in first place. But, as Russia is currently not at best terms with the rest of the world, a lot of organization-related things have been very hard to make right. Right now, I hope that we'll be able to make it. (Don't worry, there will be no issues with shipping.)

Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't want the book yourself, maybe you know someone else who does! Please share information about this campaign with anyone who will love a great read and a fancy piece of community memorabilia. Together, we will accomplish anything.
And that's all there is to it. If you have questions that haven't been answered here, I can be found on Discord: https://discord.gg/YzbVSKs

Modern Real Estate Valuation -  Guide to Real  Estate Appraisal
 
Trillions of dollars are invested in commercial real estate, such as office buildings, retail centers, hotels, and multi-unit apartment buildings.  Billions are invested in residential properties, such as homes and condominiums.   Individuals and businesses, both micro and conglomerate organizations, invest in commercial and residential real estate.   
 
Real estate holdings have climbed to new heights through the balancing of macro-economic policy, mortgage rates, and elusive market dynamics.
 
However, fortunes have ruptured through economic periods, such as the Real Estate Bubble of 2008, and the Stock Market Crash of 1929.  Individuals have experienced homelessness, unemployment, and financial disasters through these events. Organizations have filed Chapter 7, 11, and 13 dissolving the businesses which they established, abandoning the employees, and the financial structures which they built through  years of toil and sweat equity.
 

 
Modern Real  Estate Valuation – Guide to Real Estate Appraisal  represents a vast corpus of practical knowledge, invaluable insights, and analytical tools of real estate valuation, and informs and demonstrates dynamic developments transforming real estate and valuation, for now and beyond.  These developments impact individual and organizational financial liquidity and health.

I’m a graphic designer for Minnesota State University, Mankato and I love to write, paint and draw. I’ve written and illustrated five books, mostly for children and young adults. I’ve also auctioned my works off for charity in the past, most notably the <i>Howlween Creature Feature</i> event (2012 and 2014), which benefited the local pet shelter.</p><p>It’s been a tough year for everyone, especially for families that rely on food banks to make ends meet.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Take It: Genesis Mortalis</i> is a book about British teenage twins, who are anything but alike. When Madisyn Montevega creates the Unorthodox Capitalists Organized Crime Association (UCOCA), she begins to find meaning in her previously mundane lifestyle as a well-behaved heiress. Together Madisyn, her twin Marcie, and their best friend Robbie go on a series of missions to hunt down some of the most wealthy and corrupt businessmen and criminals around the world. But while this dangerous pastime might seem to be all fun and games in the beginning, it begins to threaten all of their lives in a way they would never have imagined. This new vigilante life creates further tension between the girls in vices of both power and sex, and even dares to ruin their family’s reputation, already on shaky ground as newfound magnates among old English money.<br/><br/>My name is Ashlea Hearn and I am the author of<i> Take It: Genesis Mortalis</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to create an escape for myself from a boring reality back in high school -- I daydreamed a lot in class! I would often imagine what I could do with the power to control my environment. That power mainly stemmed from a great deal of wealth and influence: two elements of control that come with more responsibility than meets the eye. I wanted to explore the dynamics of using money and power in a twisted definition of “good,” while also showing how if you’re not careful, they can turn into something evil and all-consuming. We see these instances quite often on television and in movies, and I couldn’t help but wonder just what kind of mischief people with unlimited resources were capable of getting into.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what it’s like to live in a world where wealth - while it may provide unlimited access and open doors of opportunity that would normally not exist - doesn’t always determine happiness, and that greed will eventually come to humble even the most ambitious souls. I want readers to see this book as an opportunity to explore themes of power, greed, and competition in a manner that allows the characters (and the reader) to still have fun. </p>
<h3>The Book Synopsis</h3>
<p>Sick of following orders and being her parents’ source of entertainment at lavish dinner parties, a gutsy eleven-year-old heiress from London brews up a plan to create the vigilante organization, Unorthodox Capitalists Organized Crime Association (UCOCA). With the best homeschool education and access to all the resources money can buy, Madisyn Montevega establishes her secret group all over the world, building headquarters under her billionaire mother’s luxury car dealerships. Now sixteen, Madisyn finds herself leading mission after mission with her twin, Marcelle, and their best friend, Robbie Ancens.</p>
<p><br/>Having found a most interesting target for their next mission, Madisyn calls a meeting to gather their agents of UCOCA-London. She informs them of a secret society of wealthy men led by two U.S. senators, who host a gruesome game of Russian roulette, where they convince vulnerable and desperate citizens to be their players. Their common incentive: ten million dollars. With help from UCOCA-Seattle, they must track down the next game in Los Angeles, intercept it, and steal the money before any of the innocent players get killed. </p>
<p><br/>Later on, the twins and Robbie are surprised when their tutor of ten years, Valentina Dementieva, reveals her true purpose for coming into their lives to raise them. Valentina needs their help to rescue her brother Lukas, who is trapped in the Russian boarding school she had been raised in -- the same school she escaped eleven years ago to flee the wickedness lurking behind its walls. Appealing to Madisyn’s weakness for always accepting a challenge, she insists they save Lukas, though this proves difficult when they discover his reluctance to be saved. They’ll need the help of UCOCA-Ukraine to devise a plan to get inside the fortress and live to tell the tale. </p>
<p><br/>All the while, UCOCA has an enemy brewing unknown to them: a detective who has been watching closely and finds a way to track the girls’ every move. In comparison to living above the law, handling normal teenage drama is no easy feat for the twins and Robbie, who find themselves wrapped up in a complicated love triangle that two of them will have to bury before it destroys them all. That is, unless their lives as self-proclaimed vigilantes doesn’t destroy them first.</p>
<h3>You Will Love This Book...</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you enjoy espionage and crime thrillers like James Bond, Mission: Impossible, &amp; Ocean’s 11</li>
<li>You like international adventures that explore and dive into different worlds and cultures</li>
<li>You daydream about what life could be like with no financial boundaries</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Take It: Genesis Mortalis</i> speaks to action lovers and feminists alike who want to grapple with organized crime and vigilantism in a new way.</p>
<p><br/>Ultimately, I hope that this book inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can too much competition fully turn us against the people we love and trust the most, like our family?</li>
<li>Just how long can a power-hungry boss stay in power over their “partners” and organization before either being overthrown or taking themselves out of the game?</li>
<li>What happens to those who let wealth rotten their minds since greed is such a terrible vice?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing power, competition, and greed will change us all for the better. </p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Ashlea Hearn is a Marketing Coordinator at an amazing personal injury law firm in Seattle, WA and a Logistics Lieutenant/platoon leader in the Army Reserve. She has always loved to write stories and daydream about living a more adventurous life, something she hopes to make into a reality one day at a time! She is a lover of all things creative, and has even dabbled in filmmaking and directing in college. She ultimately decided her passion was to stick with writing and becoming a published author -- her dream is to eventually have some of her books turned into movies. <br/><br/>Ashlea wrote this book as a way to more deeply explore some of her daydreams, knowing that the world she could see herself in was a fascinating one that others might want to see for themselves. These were often worlds of espionage and danger, where characters would go on missions around the world, and feel empowered by the ability to not only kill someone whose death would make the world a better place, but to also revel in their riches well after. While adventures like this do seem like all fun and games, Ashlea realized how there is responsibility that comes with these actions — like remaining humble and not allowing power and greed to consume you. These are all elements she wanted to explore in her novel as one of the main characters begins to let this new power of hers take over in completely destructive ways, showing the reality of what these vices can do to a person if they’re not careful.<br/><br/>Music has always been a big part of Ashlea’s life, which you’ll find in her book as several references are made to songs and orchestral pieces. Ashlea enjoys composing music for piano and orchestra as a hobby. She has played piano since she was 9 and violin since 11 years old, performing on stage as part of her school orchestra even throughout college as a violinist in the University Philharmonic Orchestra at Mizzou. She is an avid golfer, and has played since she was 11, though only for fun nowadays. <br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Ashlea Hearn via email at aehearn1@cougars.ccis.edu, on Instagram at @angel_ashlea, or on LinkedIn at <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ashlea-hearn-35a20a185"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.linkedin.com/in/ashlea-hearn-35a20a185</a>.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Do No Harm: Fatphobia &amp; The Medical Industry,</i> debunks the myth of weight loss within the medical space, examines how fatphobia hurts patients’ health, and explores sustainable ways to improve patients’ health without weight stigma and discrimination. Do No Harm is a great resource for patients in bigger bodies who want to advocate for themselves in the doctor’s office but don’t know how to. If you’re interested in learning about how you can take fatphobia out of your healthcare, whether you’re a patient, provider, or loved one looking to support someone, this is for you.<br/><br/>My name is Hannah Hawkins and I am the author of <i>Do No Harm: Fatphobia &amp; The Medical Industry.</i> I wrote this book because I’m tired of seeing body size discrimination impact healthcare. I know too many loved ones who’ve been misdiagnosed, mistreated, or have vowed to stay away from healthcare because of the weight stigma they experience. Everybody should experience the same level of care, no matter their size.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the antiquated systems in our healthcare need to change. Weight is not an indicator of health, and it shouldn’t be a hurdle in seeking equal treatment. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for eliminating fatphobia in the medical space, and in life, in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you advocate for yourself, offer weight inclusive care if you're a provider, or help support a loved one in their efforts to manage the fatphobia they experience on a daily basis.</p>
<p><br/>In this book, you'll learn about fatphobia and why it has no place in healthcare. Below are some topics covered in the book:</p>
<p>Diet Culture’s Heavy Hand in Healthcare</p>
<p>Racism and Fatphobia</p>
<p>Fatphobia and late diagnoses</p>
<p>Fatphobia and healthcare avoidance</p>
<p>The Health at Every Size approach to holistic health</p>
<p>How to advocate for yourself at the doctor</p>
<p>How providers can offer weight inclusive care</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are passionate about social justice issues, such as weight discrimination, are a healthcare provider who’s at their wits’ end on figuring out how to treat clients in bigger bodies without suggesting weight loss, or are a person in a bigger body who wants to learn how to advocate for yourself, and know that you’re not alone in your experiences.<br/><br/><i>Do No Harm: Fatphobia &amp; The Medical Industry</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to providers and patients who are looking at fatphobia in healthcare for the first time.</p>

<h2>The Book - <i>Do No Harm: Fatphobia &amp; The Medical Industry</i>
</h2>
<h3>
<br/>The book is written in 3 Parts....</h3>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>explores the history behind fatphobia and how our society became obsessed with thinness, which eventually bled into the healthcare system. The racist roots of fatphobia and the “obesity epidemic” are revealed, and the efficacy of weight loss is debunked. Antiquated systems’ efficacy, such as the Body Mass Index, are called into question.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> discusses the harm fatphobia inflicts on marginalized bodies. You’ll see first hand stories from people’s experiences in doctors’ offices, and will learn how weight stigma impacts diagnoses, insurance coverage, treatment options, and overall physical and mental health.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains ways patients and providers can advocate for and practice weight inclusive care. Lindo Bacon, PhD, and Evelyn Tribole, MS, RDN, CEDRD-S share insights on Health at Every Size and Intuitive Eating approaches.

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p><br/>Hannah Hawkins is a financial analyst and first-time author of Do No Harm: Fatphobia &amp; The Medical Industry. Her experience with battling an eating disorder that went undiagnosed for 6 years inspired her to research fatphobia and weight bias in healthcare. After discovering the stark disparities in treatment between people in thinner bodies versus people in bigger bodies, Hannah felt compelled to find a way to address this issue that impacts millions of people every year. Hannah is a firm believer that weight is not an indicator of health, and hopes that one day our medical system will throw out the old, inaccurate weight loss paradigm that keeps people from receiving adequate treatment.<br/><br/>Hannah spent seven months in three different treatment facilities for eating disorders and saw first hand how internalized fatphobia affects people in all bodies. In her past life, she taught group fitness classes at four gyms and ran a personal training business that perpetuated fatphobia.... up until she realized that not only was she hurting people, she was wasting her life away trying to attain a body ideal that will never be attainable.<br/><br/>What was eventually diagnosed in Hannah as a disorder is what’s being prescribed for people in bigger bodies, despite the fact that weight loss has about a 95% failure rate. This discrepancy is keeping fat patients from accessing proper healthcare; no one should be written off at the doctor based off of appearance. Hannah believes that once weight is taken out of the equation, people will better their relationships with themselves, with their health, and with providers.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Hannah at hannahhawkins32@gmail.com and on Facebook and Instagram, @hannah_hawkins_.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>The <i>Full Severity of Our Connection</i> gives voice to some of the untold stories and forgotten communities of the Jewish Diaspora. It recounts the year that I lived in Jerusalem (2017-2018) and traveled to Jewish communities across Western and Central Europe, North Africa, India, and the Balkans. It recounts my adventures, the lessons I gleaned, the interviews I conducted, and the joys (and concomitant pains) of Jerusalem. <br/><br/>My name is Kayla Cohen, and I wrote <i>The Full Severity of Our Connection</i> because my traveling experiences raised seismic questions that ruptured basic conceptions of history, collective memory, and identity.<br/><br/>This book will be of interest to those seeking an adventure/travel thrill (and from the luxury of their quarantine couch!), those curious about cultural healing and recovery from our divisive, politically-polarized current moment, and those interested in questions about Diaspora identity and selfhood. <br/><br/>My experience of leaving and returning to Jerusalem throughout my gap year held great symbolic gravity. Many of the Diaspora communities I visited had only wished, pre-1948, to have their prayers for redemption and an end to 2,000+ years of <i>Galut</i> answered. At the same time, the idea of a Jewish center and, more importantly, of a single and perfectly preserved people unaffected by the intellectual and cultural currents of majority culture began to dissolve as the meaning of a Jewish essence was constantly defined and redefined in the different communities I visited. <br/><br/>This book seeks to articulate the full thrust of unique tensions, vulnerabilities, and experiences associated with Diaspora identity for Jewish and non-Jewish readers. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>my interviews with the Chief Rabbi of Greece and Spain’s first Spanish-born Rabbi since the 1492 Spanish Inquisition, both of which offer interesting meditations on how Hellenism and Spanish culture have respectively affected their communities.</li>
<li>my successful search to find and meet the last Jew living in the Moroccan port town of Essaouira.</li>
<li>my gap year program’s meeting with His Holiness the Dali Lama in Dharamshala, India, and his speech to the Jewish community about the future of Israel/Palestine as a Tibetan exile.</li>
<li>my collection of observations from visiting different sections of the fragmented Palestinian territories and East Jerusalem.</li>
<li>my gap year program’s meeting with an Israeli-Arab Druze Holocaust curriculum creator in Berlin, who sees untapped potential for communication between Jews and Arab refugees in the former capitol of the Third Reich.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The Full Severity of Our Connection</i> challenges our fundamental understandings of identification and belonging. It ruptures our basic conceptions of self and the legacies to which we belong. It offers a moment for introspection, cultural reckoning, and healing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts:</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 </strong> is dedicated to telling the stories of the different Diaspora communities that I visited in 2017 and 2018, including Spain, Greece, Morocco, Germany, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and India. Each chapter is dedicated to one country and shares related personal anecdotes, vignettes and interviews.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 </strong>recounts my experiences of living in Jerusalem and traveling to Palestinian neighborhoods and territories before and after I started college.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>contextualizes the academic and political world of Berkeley, California (and my own college experience at UC Berkeley) within the complicated framework of Jewish history and identity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Within the Jewish community, I hope the book and its honest reckoning with the Diaspora’s legacies will push Jewish institutions to include more robust curricula on the Diaspora itself. Recognition of its enduring intellectual and cultural influences -- and its history of interaction and exchange -- could have seismic effects on Jewish education, relations to the Palestinian Diaspora, and Jewish relations to the outside world.<br/><br/>As for the book’s non-Jewish audience, I hope this book better articulates the complexity, vulnerability, and slight precariousness of Jewish identity and Jewish experience, past and present.</p>
<p>Embedded within the book’s stories is an imperative to create more robust lines of communication between Jewish and non-Jewish communities. This book can start those necessary conversations -- and from a starting point that completely reworks our basic conceptions of ""self"" and ""other.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>*Why I need your help: </h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers<i> </i>to help cover the costs for publishing my book: when I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook; when I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition; when I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.

Embedded within the book’s stories is an imperative to create more robust lines of communication between Jewish and non-Jewish communities. This book can start those necessary conversations -- and from a starting point that completely reworks our basic conceptions of ""self"" and ""other.""

About the Author
Kayla Cohen is a student at the University of California, Berkeley, where she studies Comparative Literature (English and Hebrew literature and Arabic language). This is Kayla’s first book, which is dedicated in memory of her grandfather, Dr. Rahim Cohen, a well-respected physician, journalist, humanitarian, and leader in the Iranian-Jewish community. He inspired Kayla's early love for the forces of language.
Kayla hopes to fuse her passion for writing with her interests in conflict resolution in the future. When not studying or journaling furiously, she can be found embracing the upset that is gluten-free baking and using consenting housemates as lab rats to test her grandma's Persian recipes.

I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our goals
  I want to publish this book to
inform and entertain our readers, and assist
victims of a ruthless sex trafficking industry that thrives virtually unchecked on our country’s borders.
  I want to raise awareness of the
damage caused by illegal immigration and

Because I can't do that! If you want to buy a book from me, I'd be happy to sign it with an appreciative note and ship it to you.
Dinner ideas: I can make a good lasagna, quiche, pot pie, cajun pasta, spaghetti & meatballs, french dip sandwiches. You can choose any of those, if you'd like.
Your meal may not be hot when it's delivered. Thank god for microwaves, right?
don't fund this, that's okay too.I probably haven't funded your projects in the past. That's because I'm usually just trying to make the bills. And if you find yourself in the same boat, maybe you could just share this page on your own various pages?In closing, thank you from the bottom of my heart. My gratitude is deeper than my obscenely huge stock pot. Many, many thanks!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Perks make the crowdfunding world go round. I don't know about you, but the bright, shiny things that can be acquired draw my attention to a campaign almost as much as the ultimate goal. It's in the extras a lot of the time.</div>
<div>Because of my situation, I don't have a lot of extra money to create really cool extras, but I do have a few things I <i>can</i> do... and I'm quite excited about it!</div>

<p><b>Kill a Character:</b></p>
<p>So, you want to live forever in a novel, do you? Now is your chance... sort of. I will kill a character of your creation and naming, in one of the upcoming Witch &amp; Wolf novels. Pick your perk wisely... and be prepared to be murdered in a gruesomely creative fashion.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I will send each contributor of this perk level a template for information relating to the character being killed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Note: Due to legalities, it will be necessary for each contributor of the kill-a-character perks to sign a very easy-to-decipher document stating I can use the character and name without risk of legal persecution.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is to protect both of us.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Noooo, I want to survive!</b></p>

<div>
<h3>The backstory...</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>In June 2014, the sewage line to my house blocked up. It resulted in a flood of horrible nastiness in my basement. Almost everything I owned down there has been ruined. A few items were salvaged, and have been carted away for cleaning, but a huge chunk of my material possessions have gone the way of the dinosaurs. This was once a tiled, fully-furnished basement. Now it's a literal cesspit. (Fortunately, the cleaning company has come and dismantled the basement, removing two feet of studs, all of the floors, and so on!)</div>
<div>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Until this point, I have been paying for a great deal of my production fees through working as a developmental editor. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But life has happened, and because of the sewage flood, I have to replace things -- things not covered by insurance. My electric box has to be brought back up to code. There's almost $2,000 right there. I have to pay for all of the plumbing... it's bad enough the insurance company hasn't told me the total cost of that nightmare yet.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This has eaten away at my production budget for my novels. I have had to choose between my career and my home, and my home has won.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I don't want to give up my career (or significantly delay it!) because of life. Writing is what I love, and I want to give my fans the best books possible.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Insurance is going to help transform the below nightmare into living space again -- living space I can comfortably write my books in. It won't pay for the new computer I desperately need, and was going to get for Christmas, but there is always next year or the year after. My computer still functions, albeit poorly.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Note: Everything photographed was destroyed due to sewage contamination, and this is after the first industrial-sized rubbish bin was filled and carted away... ouch.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/697951/files/20140706160847-Basement_Destruction.jpg?1404688127"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

I'll be able to publish the next three books of the series, all of which are planned out and in progress. I'll be able to give these novels the chance they deserve, and continue pursuing my beloved writing career.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With all novels, a notable challenge is knowing when the books will be ready. How do you know I'll complete this work? You don't. You have to take my word on it. That level of trust is something very difficult to earn, and I do not want to take it for granted.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, I'm going to be as honest and upfront as I can be. Here is a list of all of the projects I currently have underway, where I'm at with them, and the <i>estimated</i> completion times. I try to stick to my deadlines, but I am the type of author who <i>will</i> delay a release by a month in order to produce a better book. I have no shame in admitting that.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My fans deserve the best I can give them, even if it means a bit of a delay. Originally, I was going to release Storm Surge and Royal Slaves next, but because of so much interest in the Witch &amp; Wolf series, and my intense love of these books, I'm taking my time with these two novels. I'm also letting myself write longer, more thorough books, which do take longer. I'll be working on Storm Surge, Royal Slaves, and City of Clocks for month or two month long periods between each of the Witch &amp; Wolf novels.</p>

Murder, magic, and mayhem: The world of the Inquisition is our own, touched by the secrets of the paranormal and the supernatural. Underneath the thin veneer of modern comfort and security is a violent society of men, women, witches, and werewolves, as well as those who go bump in the night.

Some are the hunters.

Some are the hunted.

All of them have been touched by the Inquisition.

NEWS: 


Winter Wolf cover art has been updated.


If this campaign reaches goal, all perks having things mailed will also include 1 copy of the Winter Wolf cover art as a print. 


All perks $10 or more include a ecopy of Inquisitor. If you already have Inquisitor, you can contact me with info on who to send your extra copy to.

Deposits for Blood Diamond and Silver Bullet cover arts has been paid.
Sumi-e painting perk added!




My name is RJ Blain, and I am the author of Inquisitor, the first Witch & Wolf novel. I'm a bit of a cracked nut, with a fondness for MMOs, gaming, dice, art, and (most importantly) writing. I am also known for my addiction to moleskine journals, as well as my growing fondness for Levenger's circa journals. I'm owned by four cats.

If it's paper or pen, I probably love it.

You can read a sample of Inquisitor here. An unedited sample of Witch & Wolf 2, Winter Wolf, can be read here


UPDATE: All $10+ perks will include an ecopy of Inquisitor.


Due to life, sewage floods, and everything, I need your help...

With your aid, I will be able to pay my editors, my cover artist, the promotional fees to help make others aware of my novels, the copyright fees, and all of the other little things that go into turning a book into a professional product.
 Here is the breakdown of the costs to produce the next three novels of the Witch & Wolf series:

I have already paid for the cover art for Winter Wolf, which is the next novel to be released. I am covering the copyright fee for Winter Wolf on my own as well. My editorial fees, for each book, pay the minimum fee for both of my editors. I try to tip my editors with royalty money as well, as they have both been so generous to give me such a great fee for their hard, stellar work.Here is an early version of the Winter Wolf cover for your viewing pleasure:



What do you get? Perks! Perks! Perks!

Perks make the crowdfunding world go round. I don't know about you, but the bright, shiny things that can be acquired draw my attention to a campaign almost as much as the ultimate goal. It's in the extras a lot of the time.
Because of my situation, I don't have a lot of extra money to create really cool extras, but I do have a few things I can do... and I'm quite excited about it!

Note: All books are ebooks (epub, mobi, or pdf) unless specified as paperbacks.

Fun & Games



Tea Party: I will take a picture of a cup of tea I have brewed just for you. Each contributor will receive a unique photograph of a cup of tea with their name photoshopped onto the image. Then I will drink the tea and enjoy it. 

Deluxe Tea Party: I will draw a doodle on a dry-erase board and pose the cup of tea in front of it, handwriting your name for the image. Then I will drink the tea and enjoy it.


All tea party images will be showcased in a gallery on my blog, with a list of contributors.


Buy RJ a Cup of Tea: You don't want anything beyond the satisfaction of encouraging RJ's shameless addiction to tea. Thanks!

My Cats will Acknowledge You: I will take a photograph of one of my cats, being a cat, with a photoshopped acknowledgement of your support! My cats are jerks, so don't be surprised if jokes are cracked at the expense of all man kind.

I have four cats, but two are terrified of the camera, so they will not be making an appearance. Meet Princess and Tia! These two lovely ladies will mock, cajole, tease, and work their ways into your hearts. Tia is the one wearing the red collar.


Montreal Botanical Gardens Selfie Photo Walk: I will go spend a day in Montreal botanical gardens with my bestie, where photographing shenanigans will happen. I will take pictures of myself doing goofy things, or have my friend take pictures of me doing goofy things. Each contributor will get their name photoshopped onto an image.



Appear in the Novel!


Kill a Character:
So, you want to live forever in a novel, do you? Now is your chance... sort of. I will kill a character of your creation and naming, in one of the upcoming Witch & Wolf novels. Pick your perk wisely... and be prepared to be murdered in a gruesomely creative fashion.

I will send each contributor of this perk level a template for information relating to the character being killed.

Note: Due to legalities, it will be necessary for each contributor of the kill-a-character perks to sign a very easy-to-decipher document stating I can use the character and name without risk of legal persecution.

This is to protect both of us.

Noooo, I want to survive!

Dying in fun, humorous, or gruesome fashions isn't for everyone. Here's your chance to have a character named by you for inclusion in one of the upcoming Witch & Wolf novels. You'll get to survive the events of the novel... and the character named by you will get at least one speaking line.

Once again, due to legalities, you'll have to sign a little piece of paper to cover both of our asses from legal nastiness.

Note: If you want to name your character after a real person, that person will need to give their permission.

Due to how the novels are written, there is limited space for character creation.



Signed book plates:


Due to shipping limitations and costs, I won't be doing signed paperbacks in bulk. However, I will be doing signed art book plates. These are signed stickers you put in your copy of your books, or on your laptop -- anywhere you want! Each bookplate will have a different design for each novel, including Inquisitor!

Create a deity -- Claimed! 

Other Goodies!

Sumi-e Paintings
Contributors of this perk level will receive a sumi-e painting by RJ Blain. Each painting will be unique, and will likely feature spring blooms and branches.





Art Prints


Some of us love art a lot, and my cover artist makes fantastic art. I will have perks dedicated to the cover art from the Witch & Wolf series, for those who want something a little more physical.

Advanced Copies

Can't wait for the official release date? This perk will let you get an ecopy of the book at the same time the advanced reviewers do... without being required to provide a review.




The backstory...



In June 2014, the sewage line to my house blocked up. It resulted in a flood of horrible nastiness in my basement. Almost everything I owned down there has been ruined. A few items were salvaged, and have been carted away for cleaning, but a huge chunk of my material possessions have gone the way of the dinosaurs. This was once a tiled, fully-furnished basement. Now it's a literal cesspit. (Fortunately, the cleaning company has come and dismantled the basement, removing two feet of studs, all of the floors, and so on!)


Until this point, I have been paying for a great deal of my production fees through working as a developmental editor. 

But life has happened, and because of the sewage flood, I have to replace things -- things not covered by insurance. My electric box has to be brought back up to code. There's almost $2,000 right there. I have to pay for all of the plumbing... it's bad enough the insurance company hasn't told me the total cost of that nightmare yet.

This has eaten away at my production budget for my novels. I have had to choose between my career and my home, and my home has won.

I don't want to give up my career (or significantly delay it!) because of life. Writing is what I love, and I want to give my fans the best books possible.

Insurance is going to help transform the below nightmare into living space again -- living space I can comfortably write my books in. It won't pay for the new computer I desperately need, and was going to get for Christmas, but there is always next year or the year after. My computer still functions, albeit poorly.

Note: Everything photographed was destroyed due to sewage contamination, and this is after the first industrial-sized rubbish bin was filled and carted away... ouch.







Risks & Challenges

Let's face it: Writing a novel is hard work. No author can ever be certain of the success of a novel project. However, the vast majority of my fans love the Witch & Wolf series the most. I love writing them. They're fun, they're exciting.


But they aren't easy to write, and there is no guarantee of success. With your help, I'll be able to do what I love doing most: Writing. I'll be able to publish the next three books of the series, all of which are planned out and in progress.

<i><b>Send Yocheved to electrology school</b>, so she can provide no to low cost electrolysis to Trans folks across the country!</i><br/><br/>Hi! I'm Yocheved. I'm a working class trans woman of color living in Florida. I have a couple of problems I'm working to solve in one fell swoop and I want your help.<br/><br/><b>Number one</b>: trans women are overwhelmingly poor, broke, unemployed, underemployed or otherwise strapped. Everywhere. Almost always. And in a country with a heterocentric medical industry, none of our basic care gets covered. One of the simplest things we need for our emotional health and physical safety is often one of the first people notice: we need to afford hair removal, especially on our faces. <br/><br/>Electrolysis is the most versatile, most permanent hair removal solution available and costs $65-$125 per hour on average (and can take between 100 and 400 hours of treatment time for a trans woman's full face). There are a very small handful of low-rate, trans-safe/friendly electrologists scattered across the country.<br/><br/><b>Number two</b>: I am poor. Fun as it sounds, working in coffee shops the rest of my life probably won't leave me in particularly good health by the time I'm older. I'm willing to tug my own bootstraps, but the laws of physics don't support the likelihood of me lifting myself all the way up. I'm asking for a boost.<br/><br/>Receiving training as a licensed electrologist will provide me a career that could last a lifetime. This is a gateway to a much more stable life for me. I currently have no way to afford this on my own and FAFSA sure doesn't cover electrolysis school. I will be thrilled to give back to the communities of which I am a part.<br/><br/><i>So help me swoop both these the problems right into yesteryear by helping me build a carreer providing low- to no-cost electrolysis to my many trans communities!</i><br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Deal</h3>
<p><i>Let me break down this request, because $10,000 ain't pocket change:</i></p>
<p>Tuition at [tk school name]: $5,000</p>
<p>Dectro Apilus Senior 3G electrolysis machine: $4,000</p>
<p>Board Exam for license: $305</p>
<p>Electrolysis needles for use during schooling: $100</p>
<p>Total: $9,804 plus sales tax on the machine and needles</p>
<p>As part of my commitment to ethical crowdfunding, a ledger of my costs and expenditures will be available openly online at: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vmodTgVgVbz9_nEKWE-6yv96ka6R4CJVG_PqCYX35e0/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vmodTgVgVbz9_nEKWE-6yv96ka6R4CJVG_PqCYX35e0/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p><b>Furthermore</b></p>
<p><b></b>I feel strongly committed to maximizing the usefulness of this fundraiser--your donations will benefit myself, rural and poor trans communities across the South, and Wild Iris.</p>
<p>For the first year, I want to pledge 15% of profits to <a href=""http://shop.wildirisbooks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wild Iris</a>

</div></div>","Send Yocheved to electrology school, so she can provide no to low cost electrolysis to Trans folks across the country!Hi! I'm Yocheved. I'm a working class trans woman of color living in Florida. I have a couple of problems I'm working to solve in one fell swoop and I want your help.Number one: trans women are overwhelmingly poor, broke, unemployed, underemployed or otherwise strapped. Everywhere. Almost always. And in a country with a heterocentric medical industry, none of our basic care gets covered. One of the simplest things we need for our emotional health and physical safety is often one of the first people notice: we need to afford hair removal, especially on our faces. Electrolysis is the most versatile, most permanent hair removal solution available and costs $65-$125 per hour on average (and can take between 100 and 400 hours of treatment time for a trans woman's full face). There are a very small handful of low-rate, trans-safe/friendly electrologists scattered across the country.Number two: I am poor. Fun as it sounds, working in coffee shops the rest of my life probably won't leave me in particularly good health by the time I'm older. I'm willing to tug my own bootstraps, but the laws of physics don't support the likelihood of me lifting myself all the way up. I'm asking for a boost.Receiving training as a licensed electrologist will provide me a career that could last a lifetime. This is a gateway to a much more stable life for me. I currently have no way to afford this on my own and FAFSA sure doesn't cover electrolysis school. I will be thrilled to give back to the communities of which I am a part.So help me swoop both these the problems right into yesteryear by helping me build a carreer providing low- to no-cost electrolysis to my many trans communities!
  The Deal
Let me break down this request, because $10,000 ain't pocket change:
Tuition at [tk school name]: $5,000
Dectro Apilus Senior 3G electrolysis machine: $4,000
Board Exam for license: $305
Electrolysis needles for use during schooling: $100
Total: $9,804 plus sales tax on the machine and needles
As part of my commitment to ethical crowdfunding, a ledger of my costs and expenditures will be available openly online at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vmodTgVgVbz9_nEKWE-6yv96ka6R4CJVG_PqCYX35e0/edit?usp=sharing
Furthermore
I feel strongly committed to maximizing the usefulness of this fundraiser--your donations will benefit myself, rural and poor trans communities across the South, and Wild Iris.
For the first year, I want to pledge 15% of profits to Wild Iris
 and 15% to a Trans Affairs account to fund medical transitions, 
charging a sliding scale of $0 to $140  for trans people. I'll lug my 
set-up to queer gatherings/conferences and attempt to tour lgbtq centers
 in an attempt to really share this resource as far and wide as 
possible.
This may sound cosmetic, but the impact will be much more than skin deep.

<h3><font>The Backstory of Ottiya: how it all began </font></h3>
<p>As a former teacher, curriculum designer, and education policy researcher, Rufina, the Founder of Ottiya, looked around the world of education policy and research and thought, ""Where are the children's voices? Why isn't there a platform to give a stronger voice to educators, students, parents, and the diverse people working in the field of education? Couldn't there be a better way to encourage more cross-sectoral collaboration for education?"" </p>
<p><b>The Problem: Top-Down Educational Transformations Led by Standardized Data</b></p>
<p>In the world of global education policy, it often seems like a small group of decision makers and influencers get to shape the conversation about what is good for our children and schools. With the absence of a proper forum for interaction of all stakeholders of education--the ones who really matter such as students, educators, and parents--are often left out of the conversation. Families and teachers are often too busy adapting to changes in the curriculum that they do not have enough time to reflect and think about what they think about what matters in teaching and learning.</p>
<p>While we are not discounting the work of the decision makers and influencers, our concern is that what we believe to be good and necessary in education seems to increasingly depend on standardized datasets and generalizations that do not tell the full story. For instance, certain countries are deemed to have superior schools, curriculum, and teachers. Also, particular skills, subjects, and standards are said to be more valuable and necessary than others. </p>
<p><b>What Could Be: Grassroots Educational Transformations Driven by Diverse Stories</b></p>
<p>We at Ottiya<strong> </strong>want to help give a voice to students, educators, and parents and seek-out thought-provoking and creative ideas from everyone who has a passion for education. We want to give a platform where diverse peoples can come to share stories about what teaching and learning is like in their individual school, what the unique challenges they faced in their communities, and how the overcame those hurdles. In the process, we believe that we can nurture a grassroots movement to improve education. </p>
<p>We want to hear from Laura and Mathilde, two students from Denmark who want to tell us how they learn about kindness in their schools; from Sam, a first grade teacher in Somerville, Massachusetts who invited her students to reflect on their hopes and dreams at the beginning of the school year; and from Jero and Bego, two architects with a big heart for education who explored how IDEO redesigned the school cafeterias in the San Francisco Unified School District. </p>
<p><b>Our Philosophy: Ottiya as a Community Garden for Learning &amp; Education </b></p>
<p>Our Indiegogo campaign centers on the launch of the Ottiya Magazine. But, we like to think of Ottiya as more than just a publication. It is a microphone for students, teachers, parents, and diverse people with a passion for education. It is a platform for storytelling and knowledge sharing about meaningful, creative, and fun learning and education. Metaphorically, we like to think of Ottiya as a kind of community garden where we welcome gardners young and old, expert and amateur to come together to think about the seeds we want to sow and the tools we want to use to help nurture a garden dedicated to learning and education. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Interview with the Founder </h3>
<p>Rufina K. Park is the Founder and Creative/Editorial Director of Ottiya. She started this project in August 2016 after she realized that more needs to be done to (1) integrate the thoughts and opinions of the real stakeholders of education (young people, parents, and educators) into mainstream conversations, (2) to make academic research more readable, usable, and applicable to families and educators, and (3) to bring together people from diverse sectors with a common passion for youth and education.</p>

<ul>
<li>What does Ottiya mean?<i> :) Thanks for your question! Well, I love otters because they hold hands when they sleep to prevent each other from drifting away. Otter moms and cubs are especially cudly. I wanted Ottiya to embody the loving sense of family and community that otters display. So I took 'Ott' from otter and 'ya' from the Korean word which is kind of like 'hi!' and created the word Ottiya--it's kind of like hi otter!  </i>

<h3>Funding Details </h3>
<p><b>How will the funding be used? </b></p>
<ul></ul>
<ul><li>Most of the funds will be used to meet the production costs (printing, shipping, and handling), offset marketing costs, website maintenance costs,  and to ensure the production of <a href=""http://ottiya.com/submissions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ottiya Magazine Volume 2: Play. </a>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>What are the risks and challenges? </strong></p>
<ul><li>Ottiya is a licensed publishing company and we have experience printing, publishing, and distributing publications and notebooks--in fact our activity book is already being sold in Kyobo, which is the largest bookstore chain in South Korea. However, we are expecting this (Indiegogo campaign) will be our biggest undertaking of self-distributing a publication to date. While it might be challenging, we have already overcome enormous hurdles getting this far and assure you that our in-house publication team and volunteers will be working very hard to make sure you get your magazines and books! </li></ul>

In the world of global education policy, it often seems like a small group of decision makers and influencers get to shape the conversation about what is good for our children and schools. With the absence of a proper forum for interaction of all stakeholders of education--the ones who really matter such as students, educators, and parents--are often left out of the conversation. Families and teachers are often too busy adapting to changes in the curriculum that they do not have enough time to reflect and think about what they think about what matters in teaching and learning.
While we are not discounting the work of the decision makers and influencers, our concern is that what we believe to be good and necessary in education seems to increasingly depend on standardized datasets and generalizations that do not tell the full story. For instance, certain countries are deemed to have superior schools, curriculum, and teachers. Also, particular skills, subjects, and standards are said to be more valuable and necessary than others. 
What Could Be: Grassroots Educational Transformations Driven by Diverse Stories
We at Ottiya want to help give a voice to students, educators, and parents and seek-out thought-provoking and creative ideas from everyone who has a passion for education. We want to give a platform where diverse peoples can come to share stories about what teaching and learning is like in their individual school, what the unique challenges they faced in their communities, and how the overcame those hurdles. In the process, we believe that we can nurture a grassroots movement to improve education. 
We want to hear from Laura and Mathilde, two students from Denmark who want to tell us how they learn about kindness in their schools; from Sam, a first grade teacher in Somerville, Massachusetts who invited her students to reflect on their hopes and dreams at the beginning of the school year; and from Jero and Bego, two architects with a big heart for education who explored how IDEO redesigned the school cafeterias in the San Francisco Unified School District. 
Our Philosophy: Ottiya as a Community Garden for Learning & Education 
Our Indiegogo campaign centers on the launch of the Ottiya Magazine. But, we like to think of Ottiya as more than just a publication. It is a microphone for students, teachers, parents, and diverse people with a passion for education. It is a platform for storytelling and knowledge sharing about meaningful, creative, and fun learning and education. Metaphorically, we like to think of Ottiya as a kind of community garden where we welcome gardners young and old, expert and amateur to come together to think about the seeds we want to sow and the tools we want to use to help nurture a garden dedicated to learning and education. 
 
Interview with the Founder 
Rufina K. Park is the Founder and Creative/Editorial Director of Ottiya. She started this project in August 2016 after she realized that more needs to be done to (1) integrate the thoughts and opinions of the real stakeholders of education (young people, parents, and educators) into mainstream conversations, (2) to make academic research more readable, usable, and applicable to families and educators, and (3) to bring together people from diverse sectors with a common passion for youth and education.


What does Ottiya mean? :) Thanks for your question! Well, I love otters because they hold hands when they sleep to prevent each other from drifting away. Otter moms and cubs are especially cudly. I wanted Ottiya to embody the loving sense of family and community that otters display. So I took 'Ott' from otter and 'ya' from the Korean word which is kind of like 'hi!' and created the word Ottiya--it's kind of like hi otter!  

What are you covering in your next issue? Ahh, it's a top secret..! haha no, we are going to be covering 'Play' in the next issue. We would love for you to contribute in some way. Please find out more details here. If you're interested in advertising in the next issue about play, please contact us using our advertising form here.

Funding Details 
How will the funding be used? 

Most of the funds will be used to meet the production costs (printing, shipping, and handling), offset marketing costs, website maintenance costs,  and to ensure the production of Ottiya Magazine Volume 2: Play. 

What are the risks and challenges? 
Ottiya is a licensed publishing company and we have experience printing, publishing, and distributing publications and notebooks--in fact our activity book is already being sold in Kyobo, which is the largest bookstore chain in South Korea. However, we are expecting this (Indiegogo campaign) will be our biggest undertaking of self-distributing a publication to date. While it might be challenging, we have already overcome enormous hurdles getting this far and assure you that our in-house publication team and volunteers will be working very hard to make sure you get your magazines and books!",26.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>Perfectly, Imperfect</i>. My book is about my journey through mental illness, and the rollercoaster that is recovery. I include stories from other people who have faced different mental health problems in hope that it will shed light on mental illness and let others know they aren’t alone.</p>
<p>My name is Tesa Drew and I am the author of Perfectly, Imperfect. I wrote this book because I wanted others to know that they aren’t alone, and to show people that recovery is possible from mental illness. I want people to be more comfortable talking about mental illness and seeking help.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that many people struggle with mental illness and it does get better.

Perfectly, Imperfect. My book is about my journey through mental illness, and the rollercoaster that is recovery. I include stories from other people who have faced different mental health problems in hope that it will shed light on mental illness and let others know they aren’t alone.
My name is Tesa Drew and I am the author of Perfectly, Imperfect. I wrote this book because I wanted others to know that they aren’t alone, and to show people that recovery is possible from mental illness. I want people to be more comfortable talking about mental illness and seeking help.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that many people struggle with mental illness and it does get better. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn more about different mental health problems and to be able to talk more openly about mental health. Escape from your everyday life and learn alongside me as we navigate this world of recovery!
In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of perfectionism and mental health and the struggles of navigating through recovery from an eating disorder through narratives like:

The time I woke up in solitary confinement in a psychiatric ward in the hospital. I wanted to end my life, I was in such a dark place, and I was saved by a paramedic.
How I let my Eating Disorder control me and my life for so long, and how I finally managed to take back the power my eating disorder had.
 How prevalent perfectionism is in everyday life, and how it affects people differently.
Different healthy coping mechanisms I have learned to use instead of relying on unhealthy coping mechanisms.

You will love this book if you have struggled with your mental health or know someone who is struggling.
Perfectly, Imperfect speaks to anyone who has struggled with their mental health and family members or friends of someone who has struggled with mental health problems who want to grapple with mental illness and learn more in a new way.
Ultimately, I hope that Perfectly, Imperfect inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

Do we have enough adequate treatment centers for mental illnesses?
Is there enough support out there for those struggling with mental Illness?
Are people comfortable speaking up about their mental illnesses and seeking help?

I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing mental health.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Mítica Navidad</strong> nos ofrece una revisión del mito navideño, de la naturaleza belicosa de un Santa Claus irreconocible, de unos elfos que reparten su tiempo entre envolver regalos y salvar al mundo de trols y ogros...</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ipsy Dipsy es un joven elfo que vive en la villa navidad, y él, al igual que sus antepasados, heredará la tarea de cuidar uno de los grandes tesoros del mundo mágico: La bolsa de Santa Claus. Sin embargo, Ipsy no quiere eso; él desea ser parte de los guerreros del Polo Norte que combaten contra troles de las nieves y ogros blancos. Y sobre todo, su gran sueño es volverse parte de las siete espadas del invierno, los soldados de élite.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Junto a su amigo, Elont, Ipsy viajará dentro de la bolsa de Santa Claus buscando encontrar su camino para convertirse en quien puede ser. Llegando así a la ciudad del alba, donde viven los elfos del verano, unos pocos del otoño y algún que otro Nibelungo... y seguirá hasta el mismo fondo de la bolsa, donde algo muy poderoso y peligroso aguarda. </p>

Sin ninguno bello o cabello. Carentes de ropa y todos ellos hechos de la sustancia oscura como el alquitrán, que se veía pegajosa y en extremo caliente. Con vientres abultados y brazos algo largos. Con cabezas redondas sin ojos, nariz u orejas, pero sí con grandes bocas de las cuales se asomaban sus blancos dientes, con solo muelas con las que mordisqueaban todo el tiempo aunque no tuvieran bocado.<br/>          Fue el viejo Trombo que gritó con desesperación:<br/>          —¡Todos huyan de aquí! Vayan a la casa de Santa.<br/>          —Viejo —dijo Ipsy asustado, aún tomando la mano de Trombo mientras todos corrían.<br/>          —Ipsy, también debes irte. No podré protegerte si te quedas. Tal vez no parezcan temibles esas cosas. Pero créeme, son peor que los troles.

<h3>My work as an animal communicator is the most powerful, most enjoyable and deeply fulfilling work I have ever done.  After an intense near-death experience, I was given psychic abilities,  such as mediumship, seeing people at a distance, hearing from those who are silenced by alzheimers and strokes, babies in embryo and one of most thrilling of all:  animal communication.</h3>
<p>When people find out I communicate directly with animals they<br/>always ask: if they’re talking to you, what do they say?’. And<br/>this book was born. I am writing to present what the animals see,<br/>feel and communicate which is generally very soulful, heartfelt<br/>and often very funny and revealing.<br/>Also in this book I share my experiences communicating with<br/>those who have Autism, Alzheimers, stroke patients, babies in<br/>utero and infants.</p>
<p>I am taking this book to an “indie” publisher.</p>
<p>Publication/distribution costs with Conscious Shift Publishing<br/>come to $3700.

<h3>En el día de ayer 20 de agosto del 2013 un desastre natural tormento parte de la comunidad trabajadora de Villa España. El mogote que colinda con la comunidad se desplomo causando la destrucción de mas de cuatro hogares de familias trabajadoras y dejando decenas de familias sin acceso a su hogar.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>I am Mary Ellen Lapsansky, co-founder of the Perfumed Plume Awards™ for Fragrance Journalism and scent aficionado. With deep connections in the fragrance industry – most recently as Vice President of The Fragrance Foundation - I have transitioned to become a resource for luxury brands and startup companies. My skills and expertise in developing innovative programs and event platforms led me to start my own consultancy.</p>
<p>I am Lyn Leigh, co-founder of the Perfumed Plume Awards™ for Fragrance Journalism and scent aficionado. As a former Vice President, Global Communications at The Estèe Lauder Companies and former Consultant for The Fragrance Foundation, I have the experience and respect as a communications specialist with a successful track record. As a PR consultant, I now develop highly visible campaigns for luxury fragrance and cosmetic clients. </p>
<p>About the Perfumed Plume Awards(TM) for Fragrance Journalism.</p>
<p>Launched in 2015, the Perfumed Plume Awards™ is unique. It is entirely focused on recognizing and celebrating one art form writing about another art form. There is NO other all-inclusive awards program in the U.S. that specifically targets creative fragrance writing. The awards provide a showcase for writers whose published editorials or books provide a broader awareness and appreciation for fragrance through informative and entertaining “scent-centric” stories about the craft, the inspiration, the emotion and the sensory journey that are at the heart of fragrance creation.</p>
<p>While the awards recognize creativity, there is also a financial reward: each of the six winners is presented with a check for $1,000.00 and a symbolic, elegant writing instrument.</p>
<p>A milestone has already been achieved with the first Awards Ceremony held on April 8, 2016 at Rizzoli Bookstore in New York City.  The initiative has been well-received and enjoyed great success in its first year.</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>In this ever-changing and uncertain world, the one thing that offers an escape from the craziness around us is ‘art.’ There are many art forms that enrapture us and appeal to each of our senses.  The art and craft of fragrance appeals to our most primal sense – the sense of smell. It connects us to memories of our past and helps to make future memories.  It can relax, calm, invigorate, rejuvenate, and uplift the mind, body and soul. There is a never-ending well of creative fragrance stories waiting to be written.</p>
<p>Contributors will help the Perfumed Plume encourage writers to delve a little deeper, search a little further, reveal a little more about the intricate, intimate, complex art of creating fragrance.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>All contributors will be added to the Perfumed Plume Awards™ database and listed on the website with your approval of course.  Will also share with you the very special scent stories before they are posted to the website and keep you in the loop about any newly published fragrance books or exhibits.</p>
<p>We need funding of $20,000 to allow us to move forward on the following:</p>
<p>·       Enhancement of website content, i.e., collection of the very special scent stories from the many niche fragrance brands on the market, from a historical, cultural or personal point of view.  This will provide a great resource for fragrance writers as well as a point of interest for consumers. Perfumed Plume will need to enlist an assistant to help with this project.</p>
<p>·       Focus on creative fragrance writing through the organization of special events (2 to 3 a year) – book readings, writing forums, panel discussions on creative fragrance writing, Q&amp;A with fragrance book authors.</p>
<p>·       Establish a student merit award for fragrance journalism with a local college.  Merit award to be in the range of $5,000 to $10,000.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, the funds collected will go toward one or two of the three initiatives listed.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We faced many challenges in establishing this initiative but kept on going.  With the input and support of the Perfumed Plume Awards™ Consulting Committee and the commitment from several companies who believed in what we were doing, we made the Perfumed Plume a reality in a short amount of time. We are so grateful to the companies who have offered their support, but as you can imagine it is not enough to go forward with establishing and building this wonderful initiative celebrating creative fragrance writing. And as you know, support is never a given from one year to the next.</p>
<p>The Perfumed Plume can continue as it started out, but without additional contributions and support it can never grow into the all-encompassing independent recognition of creative storytelling that we set out to establish.</p>
<p>The positions we have held within the fragrance industry have afforded us the opportunity to develop and implement many successful initiatives and events over the years, large and small that have benefitted the industry and mostly the consumer and have garnered support from both.  Many of these initiatives and events are still in place.</p>
<p>We are confident that we can establish the Perfumed Plume Awards™ as an iconic symbol of excellence for fragrance journalists. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Get the word out to any beauty writers you know.  Connect with the Perfumed Plume Awards on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest.  Ask any of your friends who are fragrance enthusiasts to do the same.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<p>""I sought clarity."" So begins <em>The Edge: Life Lessons from a Martial Arts Master</em>, a new book I have co-authored with martial arts teacher Ray Fisher.

But <em>The Edge </em>is also the story of my slow and sometimes painful transition from being ""a man forever seated, bathed in the flickering glow of a monitor"" into a more fully integrated human being: someone in whom the physical (which had always been given short shrift) can now take its place alongside, and perhaps even reign in, the cerebral.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I
have a pinched nerve in my neck and I’m going to get a spinal fusion
operation in September to fix it. My insurance will not cover the whole thing
so I have turned to author friends to put together a dark fantasy fiction anthology
called </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Cadaver Bone</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. Each author is donating a brand new story and the proceeds
will go to paying my medical bills. I’m going to have cadaver bone in my neck;
you should get </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Cadaver Bone</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> for your favorite e-reader!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Confirmed authors for the <b>Cadaver Bone</b> anthology are: <span style=""font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45em;"">Cecil Castellucci, </span><span style=""font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45em;"">Christopher Robert Cargill, </span><span style=""font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45em;"">Richard Dansky, </span><span style=""font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45em;"">Ed Greenwood, </span><span style=""font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45em;"">Matt Forbeck, </span><span style=""font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45em;"">David Gaider, </span><span style=""font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45em;"">Steve Kenson, </span><span style=""font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45em;"">John Kovalic, </span><span style=""font-style: italic; line-height: 1.45em;"">Robin D.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><h3>Update: Stretch Goals!</h3>We have reached my initial funding goal and for that I am so grateful. With drugs, physical therapy, new x-rays, and follow-up visits, however, I can easily put to use any extra funds we generate. Plus, the book itself is going to be awesome and I'd love as many people as possible to check it out. </span><p></p>
<p>But wait, it's about to get even more awesome! When this campaign was announced, more author friends came forward to volunteer their talents and you know what that means? Stretch goals! You can read more about the new volunteers in the <b>Meet the Authors</b> section below. </p>
<p><b>$14,500: </b>At this level I'll add a story by <b>Aaron Dembski-Bowden</b> to Cadaver Bone! </p>
<p><b>$16,000: </b>At this level I'll add a story by <b><b>Erik Scott de Bie</b></b> to Cadaver Bone! <br/></p>
<p><b>$17,500: </b>At this level I'll add a story by <b><b>Greg Stolze</b></b> to Cadaver Bone! </p>
<p><b>$20,000: </b>At this level I'll give a little back to my talented friends by <b>paying the authors</b> $75 each for their stories. I really appreciate their help in my hour of need so it'd be great to at least give them an honorarium. </p>
<p>At I write this there are 5 days left in the campaign. Let's get out there and smash some stretch goals!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since April I have tried a variety of treatments, including physical therapy, drugs, and even a spinal injection. While I have had relief from the worst pain, none of these things provided a remedy for what ails me. I have a pinched nerve between my 5th and 6th vertebrae and I need surgery to correct it.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The doctor will put in a titanium clamp in my neck to keep the vertebrae from compressing my nerves. The procedure involves the use of cadaver bone to help fuse everything together. That means I get titanium and the bones of a dead guy in my neck! Fingers crossed for superpowers. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The procedure costs $60,000 at base. Thankfully, even my crappy insurance is OK for something like this, so my out of pocket expenses will be roughly $10,000. That, naturally enough, is my goal. That will cover the surgery itself and some of the drugs and physical </span>therapy<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> required afterwards. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What do you get? An awesome anthology of dark fantasy fiction from an all-star lineup of writers. I must say, I have awesome friends. When I first had the idea to put this benefit together, I wasn't sure if it would fly. Enormous thanks to my friends who responded so quickly and in such numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">There are to things to note about <b>Cadaver Bone</b>. First, this campaign is just for electronic versions of the book (PDF, epub, and mobi; you get the them all). Since I am running this campaign myself and I have recovery ahead of me, I didn't want to get into printing and shipping physical books. However, I will likely offer a Print on Demand version after the project is finished, and if so, backers will get a discount on that. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Second, I've kept this campaign simple. There are not a whole ton of perks full of novelty items and the like. Again, this is to make Cadaver Bone easy to </span>fulfill<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These last four months have impacted my work and life dramatically. There was a point at which I could not sit at a computer for longer than 15 minutes at a time. The spinal clinic and a neurosurgeon both recommended I get this surgery to fix the problem. <br/></p>
<p>If you'd like to read the nitty gritty of my situation, I <a href=""http://www.chrispramas.com/2013/07/11/why-i-probably-owe-you-an-email-or-something/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote about it on my blog back in July</a>. You'll note that at the time I hoped the the steroid shot in my neck would fix the problem. Obviously, it did not. </p>
<p>We've got a lot of plans at <a href=""http://greenronin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Green Ronin Publishing </a>and I want to get in good health to see them through. If you back this project, you'll be making that happen. </p>

Would you like 17 short stories from award-winning writers of novels, games, comics, TV shows, and movies? And would you like to help me pay for spinal surgery? Read on!
My name is Chris Pramas and I've been working as a game designer, writer, and publisher for the past 20 years. I am the founder and president of Green Ronin Publishing, and you may have enjoyed games of ours like Mutants & Masterminds, Dragon Age, A Song of Ice and Fire, and DC Adventures. I need an operation and my insurance is not going to cover all the expenses. 
I
have a pinched nerve in my neck and I’m going to get a spinal fusion
operation in September to fix it. My insurance will not cover the whole thing
so I have turned to author friends to put together a dark fantasy fiction anthology
called Cadaver Bone. Each author is donating a brand new story and the proceeds
will go to paying my medical bills. I’m going to have cadaver bone in my neck;
you should get Cadaver Bone for your favorite e-reader!



Confirmed authors for the Cadaver Bone anthology are: Cecil Castellucci, Christopher Robert Cargill, Richard Dansky, Ed Greenwood, Matt Forbeck, David Gaider, Steve Kenson, John Kovalic, Robin D. Laws, Jess Lebow, Colin McComb, Chris Pramas, John Rogers, Lucien Soulban, Melinda Thielbar, John Scott Tynes, and James Wallis. See below for bios of all the authors. They are a talented bunch and I am so grateful for their help. 
Update: Stretch Goals!We have reached my initial funding goal and for that I am so grateful. With drugs, physical therapy, new x-rays, and follow-up visits, however, I can easily put to use any extra funds we generate. Plus, the book itself is going to be awesome and I'd love as many people as possible to check it out. 
But wait, it's about to get even more awesome! When this campaign was announced, more author friends came forward to volunteer their talents and you know what that means? Stretch goals! You can read more about the new volunteers in the Meet the Authors section below. 
$14,500: At this level I'll add a story by Aaron Dembski-Bowden to Cadaver Bone! 
$16,000: At this level I'll add a story by Erik Scott de Bie to Cadaver Bone! 
$17,500: At this level I'll add a story by Greg Stolze to Cadaver Bone! 
$20,000: At this level I'll give a little back to my talented friends by paying the authors $75 each for their stories. I really appreciate their help in my hour of need so it'd be great to at least give them an honorarium. 
At I write this there are 5 days left in the campaign. Let's get out there and smash some stretch goals!



What I Need & What You Get
Since April I have tried a variety of treatments, including physical therapy, drugs, and even a spinal injection. While I have had relief from the worst pain, none of these things provided a remedy for what ails me. I have a pinched nerve between my 5th and 6th vertebrae and I need surgery to correct it.
The doctor will put in a titanium clamp in my neck to keep the vertebrae from compressing my nerves. The procedure involves the use of cadaver bone to help fuse everything together. That means I get titanium and the bones of a dead guy in my neck! Fingers crossed for superpowers. 
The procedure costs $60,000 at base. Thankfully, even my crappy insurance is OK for something like this, so my out of pocket expenses will be roughly $10,000. That, naturally enough, is my goal. That will cover the surgery itself and some of the drugs and physical therapy required afterwards. 
What do you get? An awesome anthology of dark fantasy fiction from an all-star lineup of writers. I must say, I have awesome friends. When I first had the idea to put this benefit together, I wasn't sure if it would fly. Enormous thanks to my friends who responded so quickly and in such numbers. 
There are to things to note about Cadaver Bone. First, this campaign is just for electronic versions of the book (PDF, epub, and mobi; you get the them all). Since I am running this campaign myself and I have recovery ahead of me, I didn't want to get into printing and shipping physical books. However, I will likely offer a Print on Demand version after the project is finished, and if so, backers will get a discount on that. 
Second, I've kept this campaign simple. There are not a whole ton of perks full of novelty items and the like. Again, this is to make Cadaver Bone easy to fulfill. 


The Impact
These last four months have impacted my work and life dramatically. There was a point at which I could not sit at a computer for longer than 15 minutes at a time. The spinal clinic and a neurosurgeon both recommended I get this surgery to fix the problem. 
If you'd like to read the nitty gritty of my situation, I wrote about it on my blog back in July. You'll note that at the time I hoped the the steroid shot in my neck would fix the problem. Obviously, it did not. 
We've got a lot of plans at Green Ronin Publishing and I want to get in good health to see them through. If you back this project, you'll be making that happen.

Other Ways You Can Help
First, you can spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, message boards, etc. That's always important in a crowd funding campaign. 
If you'd like to help more indirectly, you can always buy something from Green Ronin Publishing. That money doesn't go to me, but anything that makes GR healthier is appreciated too. 
I will need one or more editors down the road. If you have experience and would like to help out with that, drop me a line here on IndieGoGo.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

A third counted down.""Three . . . two . . . one . . . go!""The two horses burst into motion. Ari Ara clutched fistfuls of Zyrh's ivory mane. The horse morphed into a mass of muscle and thundering energy. He moved in long, leaping strides. The ground beneath her blurred. Gorlion's stallion sprinted, lithe and swift. The desert youth rode well, tucked low to his horse's back. As they pulled ahead and left her in the dust, he ducked his head under his elbow and laughed mockingly.""Go,"" Ari Ara urged her horse, refusing to give up.Zyrh bolted forward, doubling the length of his stride. Ari Ara clutched the band of muscle at the arch of his neck and clenched her legs tight around the horse's torso. His legs stretched forever as they flew across the sand. The shore of the lake sped past. Despite her white-knuckled grip, a surge of thrilled excitement whipped through her. She let out a whoop of exhilaration. Zyrh sensed her enthusiasm, lengthened his neck, and exploded. Ari Ara's eyes widened. The golden horse galloped as if he was made of wind. They gained on Gorlion. They caught up to the stallion. Then they passed the other horse and pulled ahead. The sound of the competing racer's hoof beats fell back. Ari Ara cheered as Zyrh reached the end of the lake yards ahead of the other horse.And then the horse kept on running. Read the rest by supporting the Community Publishing Campaign.

This novel is a suspense/thriller with a faith based message.  It opens new doors in the literary world by combining mainstream fiction with a christian theme in a Native American setting.  The author, a member of the Wichita Tribe of Oklahoma, believes this novel will create more opportunities for Native American writers and open the door for broader understanding of the world of Native America.</p>
<p>This story is based upon a native teen’s search for spiritual direction in his young life.  The character lives in a reservation village which is dominated by ancient traditional practices and beliefs.  Two years earlier he loses his mother and sister in a violent attack by spiritual leaders.  Although he has grown up with his father’s influence of the traditional ways he now reflects upon his mother’s teachings of the christian faith.  After discovering true faith he battles pursecution and hightened spiritual visions of his people’s dark mysticism.  The main character quickly grows in his new found faith as the shamen and leaders close in around him.  This story has many twists and turns and is extremely riviting to the point of exciting the reader to desire more.  This novel is the first installment of a trilogy.</p>
<p>You can share in bringing this inspirational suspense novel to readers around the world.  This story has also been developed as a screenplay.  This opportunity is monumental for hope and growth of Native people across America.  Donors of $40 or more, will receive an autographed copy of the novel.

Hi Indiegogo Friends! We are Claire and Joy, the Grateful Chics.  After so many customer requests and a lot of research and development, we are very excited to be able to present our next dream to you today - a fresh and unique spin on a proven favorite!
""Live a Grateful Life"" Interactive Gratitude Journal Set with App, E-Book, printed journal & bookmark! 
Thank you for viewing our project! Here is what's on this page:
_________________________________

Our company started when Joy received the very first Grateful Bead as a thank-you gift (see full details below in #3). This strand of ten simple and meaningful beads sparked a passion to share the concept of Living a Grateful Life with the world and Grateful Chics became a reality. 
Now, three years later, the wide variety of Grateful Chics Grateful Gift Products are available online and in retail stores all over the US and Canada. Claire, another Momtrepreneur joined this year. This dynamic duo of creative energy is a catalyst for bringing more Peace, Love and Joy through Gratitude. Read more about us in our bio or online...
_________________________________

There is great demand from our existing customers and retail store buyers for Grateful Chics Grateful Journal Sets.  Each comes with a printed journal, Grateful Bead Bookmark, E-Book and App codes for Smart Phones. These additional features in the set make it super cool and unique over all other gratitude journals. A soon as this Indiegogo campaign is fully funded we are ready to push the ""Go"" button for all production and finalization.  Our goal is that this set will be ready for shoppers by Holiday 2012!!

App and written journal prototypes (To enlarge images press CTRL+)
It's widely recommended by some of the most inspirational leaders and teachers to keep a gratitude journal as one of the best ways to stay positive.  Dr. Oz just interviewed Dr. Andrew Weil in July 2012 on the show talking about the power of gratitude journals!  Dr. Weil said, about writing in a gratitude journal, ""doing this for one week has been shown to boost mood for as long as 6 months"". We say, ""Count 10 blessings a day to keep the worries away!""

Inside pages with quotes and watermark. Page count is 200.
In addition to the roll-out of the Grateful Journal Sets that will be sold for $25 ($38 value) on our site, in retail stores in the US and Canada, and on Amazon, we will sell the App and E-Book separately for those who just want their journals ""On the Go"" (no pun intended).  This creates a unique marketing tool to introduce more people to our brand and products. Occasionally, we will GIFT the App code or E-Book to customers for promotions. So you see, this Indiegogo project is something that will move our business forward in many strategic ways once fully funded with your keen business sense and generous contributions!Really, our customers have been begging us for Grateful Journals! This is where YOU, our Indiegogo contributors, come in! We’re asking for $10,000 for this Campaign. This covers all expenses for the initial Grateful Journal Sets: design, printing, binding, shipping and distribution, marketing; App and E-Book design, production and registration, and production of the Grateful Bead Bookmarks, which come standard with EVERY journal set...yes, you read right!

App icon, Welcome Page and Journal Page (to decrease page size press CTRL - )
The Grateful on the Go App will be available for Android and ios (iPhone and iPad) user interfaces (UI).  After clicking on the GC App icon the user is directed to a Welcome Page.  There the user can click to write in their own journal pages and be inspired by fun and chicy inspirational quotes.  These journal pages from the App can be shared on Facebook and Twitter and saved for referring back. The E-Book version of the ""Live A Grateful Life Journal"" is for Kindle and as a simple download that can be printed for less than half the cost of the journal set. We have sourced the development of the techy versions of our project and for us to be able to afford the highest level of quality for our App & E-Book, we have been quoted a minimum of $3000.
_________________________________

A Grateful Bead Strand is a meditation, mala or prayer strand to help remember all the blessings, BIG and little, that you’re thankful for each and every day!  Prayer beads have been around for thousands of years. Ours are for ANYONE that wants to generate more good in their life no matter their faith practice.  Plus, the owner decides what the beads represent each time they are used making them unique to each person.

Visual reminders throughout the day.


The LARGE bead is for the Creator.  We're all wonderfully and miraculously made.


The three MEDIUM beads are to remind us of people in our lives.  Three people (or groups of people) that touch our lives in any way.  


The six SMALL beads are to remind us of things, places, events, happenings, little or big - all you’re grateful for each day.

Each Grateful Bead comes with a Grateful Chics signature charm and easily attaches to whatever you want. This Indiegogo Project will fund the initial roll-out of the Grateful Journal Sets which includes the printed Gratitude Journal, Grateful Bead Bookmark, plus the promo code for the App/E-Book free with each set.  See how this makes it a truly unique and very modern Journal for anyone?
This dream will become a reality with your contributions of $10,000 or more.

<p>My name is actually Daniel A. Roberts, that's not some pen name. I'm a relatively unknown author who's published five full length novels as of this time. With <em>Heroes of Valinthia</em> releasing in December of 2012, I'd like to give this series a powerful shove in the right direction. </p>
<p>My novels go before volunteer beta readers before they're published. I use their feedback to make sure my story is at its best level of entertainment. My work is edited and a I get an excellent cover artist.  </p>
<p>What I'm running short on is the marketing, trailer production and advertising spots in places where people who love to read science fiction and fantasy lurk, live and play. Obscurity is a difficult wall to break down; it takes a little more money than I currently have to give this series the shot it truly deserves.</p>
<p>I don't believe in getting something for nothing. Every reward I listed is tiered. You get the previous perks added up to the point of your generosity, so the third Perk is built upon Perk One and Perk Two, plus something extra as an example. </p>
<p>$750 is the bare minimum I need to get the ball rolling in the right direction. If I exceed my goals, then I'll be able to do so much more. I can extend promotion times, print more copies for those reviewers who want the physical novels in their hands. With enough, I would even be able to afford the digital assets for a graphics program called Daz Studio 4.5 to make my own covers for future novels. </p>
<p>If I don't meet my goals, I will fulfill all of the Perks claimed, and work from the bottom up, using whatever is there to fund promotions and advertising spots. However, I'm a born optimist. I have a feeling that when you know what kind of fun series this is, you'll be happy to be a part of helping it get discovered. Maybe we can get it on a best-seller list somewhere, when people discover its existence with your help. That one day in the future, you might be sitting down to watch a new film based upon my novel. (Oh what a dream that is for me!) Then you can turn to your date/spouse/friend and proudly say, ""I helped to make this possible."" </p>

<p><em>*Please note that each link below is to an example of the novel itself.  I linked to Amazon because you can 'peek' inside to get an idea of the actual product.  I will not be ordering the novels for you from Amazon, I'll be getting them directly from the printing press and shipping to you from my house after they're signed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Digital Valinthia - $5:</strong> You state the format, you'll get both ebook editions of Defenders of Valinthia and Rulers of Valinthia. Both ebooks retail for $2.99 each, so you're saving a few pennies on this one! </p>
<p><strong>From Earth - $10:</strong> In addition to getting the $5 perk, you'll have your name mentioned in the back of the novel, in both ebook and paperback formats, in a section titled: ""People From Earth Who Made This Possible"" So your name gets immortalized with my fun fiction, inside a real novel that will be fore sale worldwide when it's released. </p>
<p><strong>Defenders of Valinthia - $25:</strong> You get the $5 and $10 perk along with a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Defenders-Valinthia-Volume-Daniel-Roberts/dp/1470179350/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">physical trade paperback copy of the novel Defenders of Valinthia</a>, to the address you specify. It will be signed by a real live pen, no ink signature stamps are allowed for my readers! (Outside of the United States? Please add $10 for International Shipping.) </p>
<p><strong>Rulers of Valinthia - $40:</strong> You get the $5, 10$ and $25 perk, plus the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rulers-Valinthia-Volume-Daniel-Roberts/dp/1478173661/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">physical trade paperback copy of the novel Rulers of Valinthia</a>, sent to the address you specify.

<p><strong>Plus 3 More - $100:</strong> At this level of help, you're getting more than just my finished Valinthia series. You get THREE more paperback novels from my Passion Trilogy. Every novel sent out will be brand spanking new. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Different-Trilogy-Book/dp/1456549723/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Passion of the Different</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Same-Trilogy-Book/dp/1460915151/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Passion of the Same</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Passion-The-Unknown-Daniel-Roberts/dp/1461145201/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Passion of the Unknown</a>. All 5 novels will be signed by me, shipped to the address you provide. (International Shipping is already covered in this donation level.) </p>
<p><strong>Money Nuke - $1500:</strong> Just do it already, Daniel. I'm loaded with cash, this is an awesome idea, now everyone who donates at the lower perks gets the maximum rewards. Why? Because I'm wicked cool like that. You will thank me profusely on your Facebook page, Blog and Twitter. You will also write me in as a Hero/Villain in your very next novel. You will use my eye color, hair color, gender, and make me the coolest thing to cross the written page, or the most diabolical evil being to make the world tremble, my choice of course, to be either the hero or villain. This will also get me all the Perks previously mentioned. Oh yeah, don't forget, Daniel... I also get 10 free copies of that future novel, signed by you, to give away to whomever I wish for ultimate bragging rights! </p>
<h2>Funding Goals Surpassed Rewards! </h2>
<p>If you help me reach my goals, beautiful! I couldn't ask for more. In the case you think 'more is good', well partner, I agree with you 100%! So I am willing to go an extra mile for you with these goal markers in mind. </p>
<p><strong>$1000 Reached:</strong> Everyone in the $100 level gets a physical copy of ""Heroes of Valinthia"", author signed, when it's released in December of 2012. All other Perk levels get the ebook version in whatever format they've previously chosen sent in an email.  </p>

This collection is created with the intention of promoting and paying BIPoC-identifying poets and artists to create artistic-presence-as-resistance to an antiquated system of publication that appears more and more to favour white writers, and merely tokenize BIPoC writers to pay lip service to inclusivity. As we believe in supporting artists, this project will always be more about artistic fecundity and fostering community than financial success. VISIBILITY, INCLUSION & ANTI-OPPRESSION:The publication's main mission is to provide a platform for black, indigenous, and people of colour (BIPoC) from across (Colonially Known As) ""Canada"" to speak about the social impact of mental health through the lens of racialized experiences.The project originally comes from a need to highlight more BIPoC artists and writers in the predominantly-white ""Canadian"" spoken word scene (especially wimmin, femmes, and folks outside the binary), as well as the social and psychological impact of mental health narratives long dominated by white supremacy.Although explicitly titled and focused for BIPoC, this project also recognizes the need for welcomed inclusion LGBTQQIP2SAA, queer, genderqueer, trans, non-binary, bigender and agender representation, visibility for disabled individuals, and across intersections of all social marginalization.   There will be no consideration for any material embodying or representing the same hateful, discriminatory, and oppressive systems which currently exist as the object of our resistance.  This includes (but is not limited to): anti-blackness, homophobia, ableism, Islamophobia, misogyny, misogynoir, cis-sexism, transphobia, anti-Semitism, serophobia, classism, etc. Kyriarchy is a Rubik's cube of various systems we can unlock and break down with time, patience, energy, care (for self and community), and most importantly, love as radical justice.For the time being, the first edition will highlight and showcase contributions from (Colonially Known As) ""Canada"". If successful, future editions will be open to folks of other geographic locations.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

This masterly tarot shines into the hidden heart of all life, revealing the mysteries!'</p><p>___________________________Caitlín Matthews, author of <i>Untold Tarot, Lost Book of the Grail,</i> and <i>Singing the Soul Back Home</i>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></p><p>            The Raziel Tarot is a deck co-created by writer Rachel Pollack and artist Robert M. Place.  Based on thousands of years of Jewish lore, teachings, Kabbalah, magical practices, and the vast treasure house of <i>stories</i>, inspired by the Bible but going far beyond it, it nevertheless is solidly rooted in Tarot tradition.  The cards are drawn in the sensual Jewish Art Nouveau style created by E M Lilien in the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, but they are also inspired by the classic <i>Waite-Smith Tarot</i>, often with an extra layer.  For example, Strength shows a woman with a lion, but now the woman is the Queen of Sheba, the mysterious figure who comes to test King Solomon, and was probably the female lover in the Song of Songs.  Solomon himself is the Magician, his posture subtly recalling the Waite Smith Magician.</p><p style=""text-align:

title comes from a medieval Jewish myth that an angel named Raziel (“God is my secret”) gave a book to Adam and Eve that contained all the mysteries of existence <i>and</i> could predict all future events.  This is exactly the myth that has dominated the Tarot for the past 250 years—the idea that the structure of the Tarot contains the Hermetic secrets of the universe, but when we mix the cards and set them in a spread they can predict the future.  Raziel himself appears in The Lovers, one of the cards directly inspired by The Rider-Waite-Smith.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470703990/tx201vy20cdjysuymoiv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>            The card most connected to the Waite-Smith deck is the High Priestess, where we see a seated woman between black and white pillars of a temple.  This is no accident, for Waite refers to the woman as “the Shekinah,”  a term which he does not bother to explain.  In the Raziel Tarot the Shekinah becomes central, reappearing in various cards, and we learn that She is the female aspect of God—the male is the Holy One.  This idea, that god is both male and female, seems radical and modern, but in fact goes back at least two thousand years.  It also sets up the all-important theme of exile and return.  In Jewish myth, the Shekinah has gone into exile with humanity, and cannot be re-united with the Holy One until human beings re-discover their true selves.  This too is a major theme of the Raziel Tarot.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470704017/qtyvvenofqtsnhs56oyu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>            The deck also contains two extra major arcana cards: The Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life.  Despite all these levels and extra cards, the divinatory interpretations for the deck are straightforward, combining traditional meanings with some of the implications of the pictures.</p><p>            Special note: while the Book of Raziel began as a myth people  have actually created magical texts with that name, in particular a full-length book published in 1701, in Hebrew, in Amsterdam.  It is said that if you have a copy of The Book of Raziel in your home it will never burn down.  We cannot promise you that having The Raziel Tarot will allow you to cancel your fire insurance, but it can’t hurt!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img

secret traditions have been a way to experience the mysteries of life brought into a practical reality.  Oracles, omens, and tools of divination are as old as humanity.</p><p>            Here is Robert on how he came to his life’s work:</p><p> </p><p>            As long as I can remember, I have always looked to my dreams as a source of guidance. I have even had dreams that have predicted the future. So I can see now that my dreams were a natural form of divination, similar to the experience of shamans in many different cultures.</p><p> </p><p>In 1982, I dreamed that I received a phone call from a law firm in England. The phone was a symbol to indicate that the communication was coming from outside of my consciousness, and I was aware of that in the dream, thinking, “how can someone call you in a dream?  I didn’t know that that could happen.”  The dream told me that I had an inheritance coming from an ancestor in England.  The object I was inheriting had great power and I had to use it wisely.  It was called “the key,” and I was told that I would recognize it when I saw it.  Within a few days, a friend brought his new <i>Waite-Smith Tarot</i> Deck to show me.  I immediately recognized it as my inheritance.  In another day or so, another friend spontaneously gave me a <i>Tarot of Marseilles</i> deck and later I bought a Waite-Smith deck for myself. Because of the way I was introduced to the cards, I usually say that I did not entirely choose to become involved in the Tarot.  It seems more like the Tarot chose to become involved with me.</p><p> </p><p>Since then, cards and divination have become the focus of my life, a satisfying subject for my artistic abilities and for my interests in history, philosophy, symbolism, and mysticism.  All of these fuse into one thing in my decks, and the practice of divination with the decks makes them relevant in the lives of the reader and the client.  </p><p> </p><p>            And Rachel:</p><p> </p><p>Like Robert, I’ve often said that I did not discover Tarot, Tarot discovered me.  I have loved myth and tales of magic all my life.  Then, in early Spring of 1970, a friend read my cards and I was amazed at these images that were like doors into other worlds.  They seemed like frozen moments in a story, or a dream.  At the same time, they meant something, there were meanings, and ideas, and even history attached to them.  They could speak to us, and make statements about people’s lives.   Over time, I discovered that Tarot was only one expression of a vast world of oracular traditions.  I worked on different decks, designing some with artists, and drawing my own.  Twice I visited Delphi, the site of the most famous oracular temple of all, and known to the ancients as “The center of the world.”  I’ve used cards for magic, and for storytelling, and to help people—myself included— make difficult decisions, or understand relationships, or recover from trauma, or talk to the gods.  Once, Wald Amberstone, co-director of the Readers Studio, interviewed me and asked if there was a thread that connected all the different kinds of work I’ve done, the divination texts, the art, the novels and poetry and translation.  And because I’ve also written comics he asked if I had a secret identity.  I told him I considered myself a Knight of the Imagination.</p><p> </p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfXPynV5te0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p style=""text-align: center;"">Angelo Nasios interviews Rachel and Robert about <i>The Raziel Tarot</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><strong>THE TWENTY-FOUR CARDS</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470699195/i3z7u87slyyh2jcrnghc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470699249/tgp1fjycsh4ysdgkqoas.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470699290/ueurbmcjcemwqyfttnvs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470699337/prbs8mx4jqorgcptumxc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470699384/vsop3glzfwc0r4anb7e7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470699497/vkq1soo4ibo6cnkpiuo8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p><br/>THE FIRST REVIEW</p><p>The Raziel Tarot is a stunning presentation of significant mystical narratives bound within the tarot deck. In the precise artwork of Robert Place, Rachel Pollack has re-told the tales of spiritual ascent and glorious unification, through the lens of Judaic myth. In doing so, these cards provide us an illustrated architecture of paradise through which we may ascend and descend in our own life story through every shuffle and spread.</p><p> </p><p>Rachel writes that the deck deals with the “great theme” of genuine reunification and liberation; and also the <i>Shekinah</i>, the presence of god most often depicted as feminine. The leading Kabbalistic scholar Moshe Idel in his ‘Ascensions on High in Jewish Mysticism’ explores the process of reunification through spiritual ascent and this deck provides us a means of realising that ascent; it is indeed a “palace built for her [the divine spirit of Shekinah], namely a sanctuary for her holiness, sanctified and inscribed with all the inscriptions of the supernal sanctuary” (Sepher ha-Temunah).</p><p> </p><p>Should a tarot deck work with Jewish themes? None other than the great Kabbalist and mystic Abulafia wrote “know that most of the visions of which Raziel saw are based on the Name of God and its gnosis” and scholar Gershom Scholem continues, “the identity of prophecy with the love of God also finds its proof in the mysticism of numbers” (Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, p. 138). Rachel points out that divination does indeed come from the divine, and prophecy is an essential if occluded element of Jewish myth.</p><p> </p><p>The story-telling element of both Judaism and the tarot is merged together and emphasized in Rachel’s text accompanying the deck. This provides ample opportunity for the reader to explore the <i>midrash</i>, or narrative, of the process of spiritual development through the kabbalistic framework naturally underpinning the deck. This kabbalah is woven lightly but powerfully through Robert’s illustrations and is an ideal gateway into the avenues and orchards of that profound subject.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470704052/cldtcoj8ptwnyifjhllq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>A final note that Robert’s artwork again meets the challenge of presenting the most enigmatic of concepts in the most accessible manner; his World card, illustrating not only the “Bride of the Earth” but also “the King” with whom she is united, is a triumph of illustration.</p><p> </p><p>Marcus Katz &amp; Tali Goodwin</p><p>Authors; <i>The Magister</i>, <i>The Magician’s Kabbalah, Secrets of the Waite-Smith Tarot, Abiding in the Sanctuary.</i></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</p><p>            The deck and book set are designed and written and ready for the printer</p><p>                                   </p><p>            And this is where we need your help, to raise the $6000 necessary to make this happen.  Of course, we are not just asking you to contribute.  Every level of participation brings its own reward.</p><p><strong>Here is a list of the amounts and perks:</strong></p><p>One Raziel Tarot Set shipped in the USA $40 plus $7 shipping</p><p>One Raziel Tarot Set shipped International $40 plus $35 shipping</p><p>Two Raziel Tarot Sets shipped in the USA $80 plus $7 shipping</p><p>Two Raziel Tarot Sets shipped International $80 plus $35 shipping</p><p>Three Raziel Tarot Sets shipped in the USA $120 plus $7 shipping</p><p>Three Raziel Tarot Sets shipped International $120 plus $35 shipping</p><p>Ten Raziel Tarot Sets shipped in the USA $320 plus $15 shipping</p><p>Ten Raziel Tarot Sets shipped International $320 plus $75 shipping</p><p>           </p><p> </p><p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP </strong></p><p><strong>            Finally, we ask your help to spread the word.

Because of the way I was introduced to the cards, I usually say that I did not entirely choose to become involved in the Tarot.  It seems more like the Tarot chose to become involved with me. Since then, cards and divination have become the focus of my life, a satisfying subject for my artistic abilities and for my interests in history, philosophy, symbolism, and mysticism.  All of these fuse into one thing in my decks, and the practice of divination with the decks makes them relevant in the lives of the reader and the client.               And Rachel: Like Robert, I’ve often said that I did not discover Tarot, Tarot discovered me.  I have loved myth and tales of magic all my life.  Then, in early Spring of 1970, a friend read my cards and I was amazed at these images that were like doors into other worlds.  They seemed like frozen moments in a story, or a dream.  At the same time, they meant something, there were meanings, and ideas, and even history attached to them.  They could speak to us, and make statements about people’s lives.   Over time, I discovered that Tarot was only one expression of a vast world of oracular traditions.  I worked on different decks, designing some with artists, and drawing my own.  Twice I visited Delphi, the site of the most famous oracular temple of all, and known to the ancients as “The center of the world.”  I’ve used cards for magic, and for storytelling, and to help people—myself included— make difficult decisions, or understand relationships, or recover from trauma, or talk to the gods.  Once, Wald Amberstone, co-director of the Readers Studio, interviewed me and asked if there was a thread that connected all the different kinds of work I’ve done, the divination texts, the art, the novels and poetry and translation.  And because I’ve also written comics he asked if I had a secret identity.  I told him I considered myself a Knight of the Imagination. Angelo Nasios interviews Rachel and Robert about The Raziel Tarot THE TWENTY-FOUR CARDSTHE FIRST REVIEWThe Raziel Tarot is a stunning presentation of significant mystical narratives bound within the tarot deck. In the precise artwork of Robert Place, Rachel Pollack has re-told the tales of spiritual ascent and glorious unification, through the lens of Judaic myth. In doing so, these cards provide us an illustrated architecture of paradise through which we may ascend and descend in our own life story through every shuffle and spread. Rachel writes that the deck deals with the “great theme” of genuine reunification and liberation; and also the Shekinah, the presence of god most often depicted as feminine. The leading Kabbalistic scholar Moshe Idel in his ‘Ascensions on High in Jewish Mysticism’ explores the process of reunification through spiritual ascent and this deck provides us a means of realising that ascent; it is indeed a “palace built for her [the divine spirit of Shekinah], namely a sanctuary for her holiness, sanctified and inscribed with all the inscriptions of the supernal sanctuary” (Sepher ha-Temunah). Should a tarot deck work with Jewish themes? None other than the great Kabbalist and mystic Abulafia wrote “know that most of the visions of which Raziel saw are based on the Name of God and its gnosis” and scholar Gershom Scholem continues, “the identity of prophecy with the love of God also finds its proof in the mysticism of numbers” (Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, p. 138). Rachel points out that divination does indeed come from the divine, and prophecy is an essential if occluded element of Jewish myth. The story-telling element of both Judaism and the tarot is merged together and emphasized in Rachel’s text accompanying the deck. This provides ample opportunity for the reader to explore the midrash, or narrative, of the process of spiritual development through the kabbalistic framework naturally underpinning the deck. This kabbalah is woven lightly but powerfully through Robert’s illustrations and is an ideal gateway into the avenues and orchards of that profound subject.A final note that Robert’s artwork again meets the challenge of presenting the most enigmatic of concepts in the most accessible manner; his World card, illustrating not only the “Bride of the Earth” but also “the King” with whom she is united, is a triumph of illustration. Marcus Katz & Tali GoodwinAuthors; The Magister, The Magician’s Kabbalah, Secrets of the Waite-Smith Tarot, Abiding in the Sanctuary.  WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET            The deck and book set are designed and written and ready for the printer                                               And this is where we need your help, to raise the $6000 necessary to make this happen.  Of course, we are not just asking you to contribute.  Every level of participation brings its own reward.Here is a list of the amounts and perks:One Raziel Tarot Set shipped in the USA $40 plus $7 shippingOne Raziel Tarot Set shipped International $40 plus $35 shippingTwo Raziel Tarot Sets shipped in the USA $80 plus $7 shippingTwo Raziel Tarot Sets shipped International $80 plus $35 shippingThree Raziel Tarot Sets shipped in the USA $120 plus $7 shippingThree Raziel Tarot Sets shipped International $120 plus $35 shippingTen Raziel Tarot Sets shipped in the USA $320 plus $15 shippingTen Raziel Tarot Sets shipped International $320 plus $75 shipping            OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP             Finally, we ask your help to spread the word.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Short Summary</span><br/>
</h3> <p>Hello. My name is Robert Wood. As some of you may know, I have been writing in one form or another for most of the last five years or so. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I found my muse when I tapped into my seemingly endless well of emotions. It began with two incidents that felt more bothersome than productive: A series of irate emails sent to my health insurance company, and an angry letter addressed to a local politician, within weeks of each other. </p>
<p>When writing these diatribes, I quickly realized that when I was drawing on my feelings, my writing was clear, concise and passionate. </p>
<p>And it wasn't half bad either. </p>
<p>I soon launched my own sports blog called Sportaholics Anonymous, which I then parlayed into a freelance writing gig with the national sports website Bleacher Report. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">After an unsuccessful foray into the sports writing industry. I took a step back from writing while I sought gainful employment. </span></p>
<p>But that break from writing only lasted so long. </p>
<p>In fact, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I currently have four active writing projects, with three at or near the finish line. The most complete is a collection of poems that has been accepted by Dorrance Publishing (see YouTube video). </span></p>
<p>Writing this poetry allowed me to release a lot of thoughts and feelings I had been holding in over the years on a myriad of topics. Not surprisingly, the collection is titled ""Catharsis: A Poetic Purge."" </p>
<p>Since I am a first-time author, Dorrance (along with the other publishers I spoke to) was only willing to offer a self-publishing option. This allows me to keep a percentage of the royalties while also retaining the rights to the work itself. </p>
<p>The catch? <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I need to provide an investment. Up front. </span></p>
<p>That's where you come in.</p>
<p>At this time, I cannot provide the necessary investment on my own. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Therefore, I need financial assistance to fund this project. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Here are the particulars: </span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Publisher requires an initial investment of $500.00. </li>
<li>Publisher requires three (3) successive payments of $500.00, to occur every 60 days. </li>
<li>Total investment will equal $2,000.00</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> It sounds like a lot. And it is. Hence the request for assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">But like I said, I am in line to keep a portion of the proceeds from the book. More precisely, Dorrance will pay me 20% of the proceeds from each book sold via retail transaction and 30% of the proceeds from each book sold via Direct to Consumer purchase. For the record, I submitted my poetry to multiple publishers and these royalty percentages are competitive. More importantly, Dorrance Publishing is legit. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Now, if you are interested in contributing, here are the details of the crowdfunding campaign: </span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Campaign lasts 60 days from the day it is launched. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Initial campaign goal is $500 (equal to the first payment due to Dorrance). </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If monetary goal is reached, the campaign will continue as an ""InDemand"" campaign, and can continue raising money until the 60-day deadline. This allows me to raise money not only towards the initial payment, but towards the successive payments as well. </span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If either or both goals are not reached, the monetary contributions will still be put towards the paying of the installments. The more money raised the better, but every little bit helps.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p>So, what do you get if you contribute?</p><p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">$10 Contribution: A thank you. It may seem trivial, but you deserve my gratitude. </span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">$25 Contribution: A copy of the work once it is published. Seems like a fair reward for your contribution. </span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">$100 Contribution: A copy of the book along with a Direct to Consumer postcard, to use for future purchases or to pass on to another interested party if you choose. Plus, a reservation at an author's appearance in the future. </span></li>
</ul><div>But what it really comes down to is the ""Why?"" Why should you contribute to this particular campaign? </div><div>I know, I already said that I don't have the funds to get this work published. But beyond the financial reasons: Why should you help get this work of literature get published?</div>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">First of all, because it would mean something to me. I have put an immense amount of time, effort and energy into completing this work, and I want nothing more than to see it published. </span></p><p>Second of all, and more importantly, because it would mean something to those who are able to read my poems once they are published. My poems are about a wide array of topics -  love, loss, birth, death, addiction, depression, and the search for meaning in the world, to name a few - and they seem to strike a chord. One poem in the collection - about addiction - was actually read in a Narcotics Anonymous meeting by a former classmate who saw me post the poem on Facebook.

 Hello. My name is Robert Wood. As some of you may know, I have been writing in one form or another for most of the last five years or so. 

I found my muse when I tapped into my seemingly endless well of emotions. It began with two incidents that felt more bothersome than productive: A series of irate emails sent to my health insurance company, and an angry letter addressed to a local politician, within weeks of each other. 
When writing these diatribes, I quickly realized that when I was drawing on my feelings, my writing was clear, concise and passionate. 
And it wasn't half bad either. 
I soon launched my own sports blog called Sportaholics Anonymous, which I then parlayed into a freelance writing gig with the national sports website Bleacher Report. After an unsuccessful foray into the sports writing industry. I took a step back from writing while I sought gainful employment. 
But that break from writing only lasted so long. 
In fact, I currently have four active writing projects, with three at or near the finish line. The most complete is a collection of poems that has been accepted by Dorrance Publishing (see YouTube video). 
Writing this poetry allowed me to release a lot of thoughts and feelings I had been holding in over the years on a myriad of topics. Not surprisingly, the collection is titled ""Catharsis: A Poetic Purge."" 
Since I am a first-time author, Dorrance (along with the other publishers I spoke to) was only willing to offer a self-publishing option. This allows me to keep a percentage of the royalties while also retaining the rights to the work itself. 
The catch? I need to provide an investment. Up front. 
That's where you come in.
At this time, I cannot provide the necessary investment on my own. Therefore, I need financial assistance to fund this project. 
Here are the particulars: 


Publisher requires an initial investment of $500.00. 
Publisher requires three (3) successive payments of $500.00, to occur every 60 days. 
Total investment will equal $2,000.00

 It sounds like a lot. And it is. Hence the request for assistance. 
But like I said, I am in line to keep a portion of the proceeds from the book. More precisely, Dorrance will pay me 20% of the proceeds from each book sold via retail transaction and 30% of the proceeds from each book sold via Direct to Consumer purchase. For the record, I submitted my poetry to multiple publishers and these royalty percentages are competitive. More importantly, Dorrance Publishing is legit. 
Now, if you are interested in contributing, here are the details of the crowdfunding campaign: 


Campaign lasts 60 days from the day it is launched. 

Initial campaign goal is $500 (equal to the first payment due to Dorrance). 

If monetary goal is reached, the campaign will continue as an ""InDemand"" campaign, and can continue raising money until the 60-day deadline. This allows me to raise money not only towards the initial payment, but towards the successive payments as well. 
If either or both goals are not reached, the monetary contributions will still be put towards the paying of the installments. The more money raised the better, but every little bit helps.  

So, what do you get if you contribute?
$10 Contribution: A thank you. It may seem trivial, but you deserve my gratitude. 
$25 Contribution: A copy of the work once it is published. Seems like a fair reward for your contribution. 
$100 Contribution: A copy of the book along with a Direct to Consumer postcard, to use for future purchases or to pass on to another interested party if you choose. Plus, a reservation at an author's appearance in the future. 
But what it really comes down to is the ""Why?"" Why should you contribute to this particular campaign? I know, I already said that I don't have the funds to get this work published. But beyond the financial reasons: Why should you help get this work of literature get published?
First of all, because it would mean something to me. I have put an immense amount of time, effort and energy into completing this work, and I want nothing more than to see it published. Second of all, and more importantly, because it would mean something to those who are able to read my poems once they are published. My poems are about a wide array of topics -  love, loss, birth, death, addiction, depression, and the search for meaning in the world, to name a few - and they seem to strike a chord. One poem in the collection - about addiction - was actually read in a Narcotics Anonymous meeting by a former classmate who saw me post the poem on Facebook. He later said it really helped him as well as those who heard it. It may help that I tend to explore the topics I wrote about more deeply than my readers are accustomed to, forcing them to explore these ideas and concepts in their own lives. If my poems weren't deep, then they wouldn't be worth writing, let alone publishing. At this point, I think I've generated enough pixels on my own behalf. I would again ask you to please contribute to my campaign to help me publish my work of poetry. But at the very least, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration. -Robert Wood",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Particularly for disengaged young adults.<br/><br/>My name is Carlos Carpizo and I am the author of At Risk of Greatness. I wrote this book because I’ve experienced the challenges faced by young adults up-close and personal.

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Shoshanah graduated as an Occupational Therapist (OT) in 1990 and has worked in 4 countries and in several different types of facilities. She has been published in a professional publication, a magazine, on websites and blogs. Her first book ""Tuvia Finds His Freedom"" was written and photographed with her husband Rabbi Eliyahu Shear.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge in OT that Shoshanah has encountered, is a lack of adequate knowledge or recognition of the profession. This results in poor or limited referrals with many clients having to wait months or years for an appropriate referral, if it happens at all. It does not have to be this way if only the profession would be well understood. </p>
<p>A number of her patients and their families requested that Shoshanah write a book to help to promote this important profession. This book has taken many years to reach the stage that it is nearly ready to be made available to the public. Your help is needed to help to get the book to its final goal, i.e. to be well marketed and known by all those who could benefit from reading the book </p>
<p><strong>Why Self-Publishing?</strong></p>
<p>Along the journey in writing this book, Shoshanah consulted with the American Occupational Therapy Association who encouraged her to self-publish so as to reach as wide a readership as possible. Self-publishing also gives her more control over content, layout, how and where to market and promote the book.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The amount requested will be used to cover:</p>
<p>- Editing, including being able to convert this book into audio for the visually impaired: $4000</p>
<p>- Cover Design: $2000</p>
<p>- Marketing and Promotion including paid adverts, printing items for marketing, giving out copies to obtain book reviews etc: $10 000</p>
<p>- Book Launch: $2000</p>
<p>- Interior book design, layout and finishing touches, including purchasing certain stock photographs which would enhance the book : $5000</p>
<p>- Printing: $10 000</p>
<p>- Upgrading our website, software and equipment: $4000</p>
<p>- If sufficient funds come in, Shoshanah would love to have the book translated into Hebrew too.  Confirmation as to cost involved is still required.</p>
<p>For those who contribute, copies can only be ordered once Shoshanah has received the funds Following this, 1 - 3 weeks needs to be given for shipping of books. All those who donate will be notified as to when the book launch will take place and will be invited to join the book launch, provided that a minimum amount is received to bring the book to the stage of a book launch. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The lack of sufficient recognition of the profession leads to a reduction in appropriate referrals. To illustrate, when networking to obtain letters to support this book, Shoshanah approached several doctors, among them a family doctor (G.P.) The family doctor, upon reading the title of the book, was convinced that OT is involved in using sport in therapy and had no idea what OT actually is. She grappled to understand that activity can be more than just sport. Further in the discussion it transpired that the doctor does not refer to OT at all, due to lack of understanding as to what OT can offer her patients. She is one of many medical practitioners who are not referring to OT. In addition, their patients suffer through not receiving the intervention they require. </p>
<p>The potential impact can best be described through the following excerpts from letters to support the book that have been obtained thus far. I am working on obtaining further letters.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts from Letters to Support the Book:</strong></p>
<p>1) ""... This book will be read with interest by patient's families, all health care students, medical practitioners, who will be enlightened further, and gain significant understanding of patient care."" ~ Emeritus Professor Tuviah Zabow</p>
<p>2) ""... Undoubtedly you are performing a wonderful service by helping us all, not only in the medical profession, but in the general public, to be more aware of what occupational therapy can offer."" ~ Norman Samuels, M.D., Medical Director and Retired Obesity Surgeon</p>
<p>3) ""... I love it so much ... It applies to so many audiences..., patients, caregivers, parents, professionals, etc..."" ~ Amanda, Beta Reader and mother of a child who received OT</p>
<p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p>
<p>As indicated in the excerpts above, the target audience includes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>lay people (i.e. potential clients and their families), the medical team especially doctors, all students in fields related to healthcare and education, professionals, secretaries of organizations / healthcare facilities. business consultants. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Considerable time has already gone into writing this book in order to get it ready for publishing. The book shown in the video and photograph is the 3rd proof copy that has been ordered and is currently being proof read, edited and revised. Your help is needed to help reach this final goal of making the book available to the public and working to promote it effectively. We would love to bring out this book in the next few weeks. The biggest risk to not receiving the necessary funds will be that those who could benefit from the book will not know that it exists. </p>

Gaining Ground tells a different story. This is the story of how a small, volunteer-based organization –Mano a Mano International Partners – has steadily and dramatically improved the health and economic well-being in one of the poorest corners of the world, Bolivia.</i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> -Christine Ver Ploeg (From the Introduction of </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Gaining Ground</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">)</span></p><p></p><p></p><h1>The Book</h1><p><i>Gaining Ground: The Creation and Evolution of a Private International Aid Organization</i> is written by Joan Velasquez, co-founder of Mano a Mano International Partners. It describes how, in just twenty years, this private, largely volunteer, humanitarian aid organization has dramatically improved the health and economic well-being of rural villagers in Bolivia. Joan has written this book to respond to many requests from international humanitarian non-profits and non-governmental organizations for guidance regarding their own efforts to alleviate the worst effects of world poverty. <i>Gaining Ground </i>describes in detail a unique model that has been amazingly effective. It also tells the compelling story of a husband and wife who made a dinner table vision come to life. That vision has resulted in an organization that in just two decades has provided over one hundred Bolivian villages with medical clinics, school buildings, teacher housing, sanitation facilities, roads, landing strips, agricultural programs and water.</p><p>Twenty years after its modest starting point, Mano a Mano finds itself uniquely situated to offer counsel and encouragement. Its experiences in Bolivia have differed markedly from those of many other non-profits with similar humanitarian objectives. This book is offered as an account of one organization’s humble beginnings and how it grew into an international aid organization that has made such a dramatic difference in a developing country. The hope is that others will take the best of the Mano a Mano experience, shape it to meet their own needs, and then tackle the challenges of acute poverty in their own corners of the world.</p><p><i>Gaining Ground</i> has now been written and is currently undergoing a final edit. We now turn to YOU for financial support to publish it. When published all sales proceeds will go to Mano a Mano. This organization has been built on principles of stewardship, frugality, tens of thousands of volunteer hours and private donations. This means that nearly 100% of all donations go to support the projects in Bolivia. Your financial support will make <i>Gaining Ground </i>a reality without diverting limited funds that are already committed to projects that literally mean the difference between life and death in Bolivia. For examples, see <a href=""http://www.manoamano.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.manoamano.org</a> </p><p>Please help support our vision, so that together we can help eliminate poverty around the globe.</p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Mano a Mano International Partners</p><h1>Our Model</h1><p>Mano a Mano’s successful model, participatory development, is not a product of conventional international development literature or research or US based non-profit practices. Instead the organization has disregarded preconceived notions of how things are supposed to be done and focused on what makes sense and how to make things happen. The Mano a Mano community-based model rejects conventional top down approaches in favor of trust and reliance on grassroots expertise and reflects what the organization has always seen as its greatest strengths: integrity, frugality, commitment, ingenuity and nimbleness.

Gaining Ground tells a different story. This is the story of how a small, volunteer-based organization –Mano a Mano International Partners – has steadily and dramatically improved the health and economic well-being in one of the poorest corners of the world, Bolivia. -Christine Ver Ploeg (From the Introduction of Gaining Ground)The BookGaining Ground: The Creation and Evolution of a Private International Aid Organization is written by Joan Velasquez, co-founder of Mano a Mano International Partners. It describes how, in just twenty years, this private, largely volunteer, humanitarian aid organization has dramatically improved the health and economic well-being of rural villagers in Bolivia. Joan has written this book to respond to many requests from international humanitarian non-profits and non-governmental organizations for guidance regarding their own efforts to alleviate the worst effects of world poverty. Gaining Ground describes in detail a unique model that has been amazingly effective. It also tells the compelling story of a husband and wife who made a dinner table vision come to life. That vision has resulted in an organization that in just two decades has provided over one hundred Bolivian villages with medical clinics, school buildings, teacher housing, sanitation facilities, roads, landing strips, agricultural programs and water.Twenty years after its modest starting point, Mano a Mano finds itself uniquely situated to offer counsel and encouragement. Its experiences in Bolivia have differed markedly from those of many other non-profits with similar humanitarian objectives. This book is offered as an account of one organization’s humble beginnings and how it grew into an international aid organization that has made such a dramatic difference in a developing country. The hope is that others will take the best of the Mano a Mano experience, shape it to meet their own needs, and then tackle the challenges of acute poverty in their own corners of the world.Gaining Ground has now been written and is currently undergoing a final edit. We now turn to YOU for financial support to publish it. When published all sales proceeds will go to Mano a Mano. This organization has been built on principles of stewardship, frugality, tens of thousands of volunteer hours and private donations. This means that nearly 100% of all donations go to support the projects in Bolivia. Your financial support will make Gaining Ground a reality without diverting limited funds that are already committed to projects that literally mean the difference between life and death in Bolivia. For examples, see www.manoamano.org Please help support our vision, so that together we can help eliminate poverty around the globe.Thank you, Mano a Mano International PartnersOur ModelMano a Mano’s successful model, participatory development, is not a product of conventional international development literature or research or US based non-profit practices. Instead the organization has disregarded preconceived notions of how things are supposed to be done and focused on what makes sense and how to make things happen. The Mano a Mano community-based model rejects conventional top down approaches in favor of trust and reliance on grassroots expertise and reflects what the organization has always seen as its greatest strengths: integrity, frugality, commitment, ingenuity and nimbleness. The dramatic difference Mano a Mano has made to the lives of hundreds of thousands of Bolivian paisanos in just twenty years affirms the efficacy of that model. Every Mano a Mano project is or soon will be self sustaining. For further details please see www.manoamano.orgOur ResultsSince its humble beginnings in 1994, Mano a Mano has: Shipped 3.5 million pounds of medical, school and construction supplies to BoliviaBuilt 144 clinics to provide health care access to over 700,000 Bolivians  Constructed 1400 kilometers in roads, helping isolated communities gain access to markets Constructed 6 large agricultural reservoirs and 153 water ponds, improving the crop yields, nutrition and income for thousands of familiesBuilt 49 schools, with teacher housing and community bathrooms And provided air rescue to 2,000+ patientsHowever, NONE of this would have been possible without both the hard work and community support of the Bolivian people, and financial support of people like YOU. RewardsAll backers will receive a 501(c)(3) receipt, making your Indiegogo contribution tax deductible. 2014 Calendars, written in Spanish and English, are available at the $25+ level and include pictures of many of the great things Mano a Mano has done over the past year. Hand woven coin purses and oven mitts are available at the $100+ level. These handcrafts help support both the rural Bolivian families who make them and Mano a Mano's work within their communities. Hand woven Alpaca Scarfs are available at the $500+ level.  Handmade Bolivian purses/bags are available at the $1000+ level.  We are only able to ship rewards to US addresses.

<div>It's the most diverse and comprehensive local mushroom cookbook ever published. Its focus is on west coast mushrooms, but many species are found globally, and across the U.S. If you love mushrooms, but don't eat wild ones, you can adapt many of our recipes to store-bought mushrooms.</div>
<div>Alison has been mushrooming for 44 years, and cooking for 42 years. She's had a number of jobs as prep cook and cook in restaurants, and has also done catering. She's teacher-aided for college level mushroom identification courses, and leads mushroom walks and tours.</div>
