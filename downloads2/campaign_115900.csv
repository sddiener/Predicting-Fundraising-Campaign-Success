<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Tamara Shiloh and I'm really very excited about this series of children's books. Black History is American/U.S. History and my books will assist teachers with incorporating Black History into their social studies, American history and/or U.S. History curriculum without having to change anything.</p>

<p>I think it's unfair that children aren't learning a more complete version of American history. Black children need to learn more about their history to provide them with options for careers and positive role models.</p>
<p>Black History children's books open up students to different experiences and perspectives so they can share with one another. It gives them a better sense of how America came to be.</p>
<p>Remember, helping me helps kids. I'd like to get these books into as many children's hands and libraries across the nation that I can.</p>
<p>These books will undeniably benefit all students through the inclusion of voices that rarely make the curricular cut.</p>
<p>Remember, children are not born racists, it's a learned behavior. The more they know, they more they grow.</p>

<h3>It all began as a simple art project.....</h3>
<p>I began the Zodiac Mandala project as a way of combining my love for art and astrology. I decided to create one new mandala each zodiac season that would embody the nature of the that sign. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517258153/nrbhafvmm2szhorokjsy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>""The longest journey is the journey inwards of him who has chosen his destiny."" </i></strong><strong><i>~ Dag Hammarskjold</i></strong></p>
<p>The project was truly life changing for me. I had no idea what it would turn into when I started it. Working through the pattern of the zodiac in alignment with nature and in a self reflective manner was incredibly profound. Not only did I learn about myself and my own internal cyclical patterns, I also learned so much more about the language of astrology than any book could've taught me. My teacher always told me that the best way to learn about astrology is by observing nature. So by observing both the outside world around me and my own internal world, I came to a deeper understanding of the language of astrology and my relationship to it.</p>
<p>After one year I had an entire mandala representation of the zodiac. But the project did not feel complete. It wasn't enough to just keep these drawings and all their lessons to myself. I realized I needed to be able to share this experience with others in order to share the wisdom and healing that working through the zodiac cycle offers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517258310/xvplbyie9e1wxuqfhnyi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>I created this book to take you on a self reflective journey to guide you back into your heart and your unique creative power. It begins in a space of prayerful intention setting and then you begin to take movement, traveling through the growth cycle of the zodiac wheel. </p>
<p>The book is divided into twelve sections, one for for each zodiac sign. Within each section, you'll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writings on the teachings that each sign brings and why it operates in the way it does based on its placement in the cycle.</li>
<li>Examples of different ways the energy manifests in nature and our lives.</li>
<li>Ways to integrate the lessons of the sign and work with them in your life.</li>
<li>Reflection questions aimed to turn your attention inward so you can feel how you embody the energy of the sign. Questions to help you determine what your relationship is like with this astrological force and to help you work through the development and manifestation of your intention at each specific stage of the growth cycle.</li>
<li>Mantras that invoke the energy of the sign within you.</li>
<li>The blank mandala representing the energy of the sign for you to color while you are reflecting on the questions.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>""We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us."" ~ Proust​</strong></i></p>
<p>This book is a reflection of how I work with the zodiac signs and their evolutionary pattern. By working through this cycle with intention in a creative and reflective way, I have come to find so much healing for myself. Learning the language of astrology has helped me heal and mend old thought patterns and karmic stories, understand my complex emotional cycles, gain new insight and perspective on my true path I am meant to walk, and develop a better understanding of the people in my life, ultimately nurturing healthier relationships. It has changed my life in such a positive and drastic way that I want to share the teachings with others who wish to embark down their own healing path.</p>
<h3>Everything we need to get this Project moving forward:</h3>
<p>The book is complete and is going through the final stages of editing. This is where your contributions come in! In order for me to get the book published I need to have a certain number of books printed and stored, and I also need to set up a system for global distribution and selling online. Here is a breakdown of what I need the funds for:</p>
<ul>
<li>$200 for ISBN and copyrights</li>
<li>$1600 for global distribution (this allows me to get my book on Amazon and in retail stores all over the world!)</li>
<li>$600 for a ""Buy direct from the author"" website </li>
<li>$5000 for 500 copies of the book to be printed and stored in a warehouse (that is the minimum amount of books I can order at a time)</li>
<li>$400 for the shipping of 500 books to warehouse</li>
<li>$200 Indiegogo fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Any amount (even if I don't reach my goal) helps tremendously and will be put towards the publishing of this book. Any money raised that exceeds my goal will go towards printing more copies of the book and publishing more of my mandala art with the world. It will also go towards the production of the next reflective mandala book I want to create (a book with mandalas representing each of the planets in astrology and reflecting on their teachings!)</p>
<h3>The Perks!</h3>
<p>To thank you for your donations, I've put together some awesome perks. Included in the donations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A digital download of a zodiac mandala of your choice to print and color</li>
<li>Up to 8 copies of the book when it is printed</li>
<li>Astrological Advice: You get the opportunity to ask me anything you need clarity or insight on in your life right now and I will take a look at your chart and give you some insightful astrological advice to help guide you</li>
<li>Up to two 2 Hour long Astrology Consultations with me</li>
<li>Custom zodiac mandala mugs and shirts</li>
<li>Extra digital downloads of non zodiac mandalas that I have already created for you to print out and color</li>
<li>A brand new, original mandala art piece created and framed just for you</li>
<li>A year long Astrological Coaching session</li>
</ul>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What are you contributing to?</h3>
<p>My hope is to spread the healing power of astrology to as many people as possible and your donation is contributing directly to that healing. </p>
<p>I believe that at this point in time there is a lot of healing that needs to happen in our world. As a species we've become disconnected from the Earth and by doing that, we've become disconnected from ourselves. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>""But, young friend (and no matter your age, to me you are young), of all the days I have witnessed, today -- your day -- is the most unhappy. I see it in the faces I meet on sidewalks and in the voices I hear in your cities. Mother Earth has never been more crowded, yet her inhabitants have never been more lonely."" ~ The Seven Paths</i></strong></p>
<p>The only way to heal the world around us is by healing ourselves. We need to bring our awareness back down into our hearts. We need to connect into our spiritual truth and our life's purpose. We need to find harmony within ourselves and our relationship to all of inhabitants we share this life with. What that healing will ultimately look like is going to be different for everyone! </p>
<p>That's why I love astrology. Because there are so many different truths out there, so many different manifestations of love and finding harmony. And all those differences are what make life so beautiful! But when you take away the layers, underneath you'll find that they all stem from the same places. They all share the same themes. Astrology gives us the underlying framework for all of life. It connects us to those deeper and universal themes that we all share. In that way, when we begin to cultivate a relationship with these common themes we can develop a better sense of connection to others and the world around us. But we also can choose from an infinite amount of possibilities for how we want those universal themes to show up in our own life! I absolutely love seeing all the different ways these teachings and themes manifest themselves through different people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>“Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.” ~ Pablo Picasso</i></strong></p>
<p>At my core I consider my self an artist. Ever since I began studying astrology three and a half years ago, I have come to discover what a beautiful art form astrology really is. It shifts your lens of perception and opens your eyes to all of the beauty and magic that this life has to offer. It allows you to see the connectedness in all of Nature and shows you how all of life moves,as it dances through cyclical patterns.</p>
<p>I believe art is such a powerful tool for healing and an essential part of our human life. And we are all artists. By tapping into our creativity we tap into our heart. And we are meant to be creative with our lives and with ourselves! We are the artists and our lives are the canvas. </p>
<p>We all have a direct relationship with the forces that are at play within our lives. We all have the power to create and manifest the life we want to live and the person we want to become. By understanding our direct and unique relationship with the astrological forces within our lives, we can work with them and color them however we wish to see them!</p>

Short Summary
 As the host of MrExcel.com, I've written a lot of books about Excel. I like to have fun with my books, often with unusual titles and covers.
As I was growing up in the 70's and 80's, there were plenty of examples of books, films, and record albums coming out with Roman numerals: Led Zeppelin II, Chicago III, Rocky IV, Star Wars Episode V.
I am about to write my 40th Excel book. About a year ago, it struck me that the Roman numeral for 40 is XL. My books are about Excel. XL. Excel. Get it? I thought it would be funny if my 40th Excel book was titled MrExcel XL ...as in =ROMAN(40). In honor of my XLth book - I am collaborating with the original Indiegogo supporters to come up with the 40 (XL) greatest Excel tips. 
As this idea coalesced, I wanted a full-color glossy book. Well illustrated with custom artwork. Something fun and short. I've written plenty of 5 pound books and books with 512 (DXII?) Excel tips. This book will feature the 40 (XL!) best Excel tips. Something you can flip through in less than an hour (LX Minutes) and something that will save you XL hours a year.
The Impact You can help me create a really useful and fun Excel book. White collar productivity could skyrocket using the tips in this book.  You can help fund the extra cost to do the book in color. Crowd-sourcing which tips make the cut for the 40 best Excel tips will provide a book that appeals to a wider range of people. I've published a lot of books before. I can get this done, but your help will make it a stellar book.    Risks & Challenges

<p>Women in Voice started its journey with an intimate concert in an alternative café in West End in 1993.</p>
<p>Now, twenty-two years later, it is arguably the longest constantly running local production in Brisbane’s history and a much-loved feature of our music and theatre landscape.

<p>WIV's success lies in its focus on the support of each artist’s unique work. It does not just create an opportunity for an artist to share their voice, it encourages them to find their unique voice. The power of Women In Voice lies in embracing unity through diversity.</p>
<p>WIV ignores preconceived structures and conventions for women performing artists and creates its own. It rejoices in saying: Yes, Christine Johnston, dressing in an icecream cone and singing a black Sabbath song is a great idea. Yes, Kate Miller Heidke, singing your original song about how everyone keeps telling you, you should go on bloody Australian Idol is fantastic. Yes, Alison St Ledger, you’d make a great Elvis impersonator. Yes, Chrissy Amphlett, singing new songs that are worlds away from your famous rock hits is a great idea. Yes, Katie Noonan, singing duets with your mum would be awesome. Yes, Carita Farrer Spencer using puppet pets to sniff your crotch as you sing cabaret would really work! Yes, Pearly Black, everyone will love Bulgarian folk songs once they’ve heard them sung by you.

ephemera, letters and diary inside h<span>ad fallen</span> prey to mice, moths, and time, they were intriguing and
shrouded in mystery. They made me wonder where Dad had been during the war and
how each piece of this discovery fit into his past. As I began to research his
collection and more facts of Dad’s life emerged­—that he and his buddy had a
photo-printing shack on base on Corsica, that between 1943 and 1945 he survived
59 B-25 bomber missions as a tail gunner—I kept feeling his spirit near me.
Even my little nephew insisted that he saw “Bumpa” standing by the apple tree. From
all that, an idea began to form—what if ghosts could transfer memories to the
living? How would that happen? In pursuit of this idea, and the desire to make
sense of my father’s unspoken past, the supernatural novel THE TAIL GUNNER was
born. </p>

shrouded in mystery. They made me wonder where Dad had been during the war and
how each piece of this discovery fit into his past. As I began to research his
collection and more facts of Dad’s life emerged­—that he and his buddy had a
photo-printing shack on base on Corsica, that between 1943 and 1945 he survived
59 B-25 bomber missions as a tail gunner—I kept feeling his spirit near me.
Even my little nephew insisted that he saw “Bumpa” standing by the apple tree. From
all that, an idea began to form—what if ghosts could transfer memories to the
living? How would that happen? In pursuit of this idea, and the desire to make
sense of my father’s unspoken past, the supernatural novel THE TAIL GUNNER was
born.

</div></div>","This book is about a project and the project is all about a brand new method of generating pollution-free energy, and yet both the project and the book turned out to be much more than expected.  
 
It all began as nothing more than a challenge to a teenager who did what his dad taught him and used his head.  The challenge became a concept, and the concept evolved over decades and then became a project.  A machine was built, and then another and another.  Hundreds of configurations, thousands of tests … and it all became reality!  
 
There are many parts to the story that are astounding but the best news of all is that we now have the solution to the world’s energy problems.  That last sentence felt a little too subtle as I was writing it.  Let me say this again with a bit more umph, and whether or not you’ve heard of it already, please pay close attention:    we now have a brand new method of producing all of the pollution-free energy that we will ever need and unlike all the well-known alternatives, this method does not rely on any outside source of power:  it is fully sustainable, totally green, and very cost effective.  The list of advantages and applications can go on and on but for now . . . back to the book.

The Beaten Path, was published in 2010, but the project wasn’t quite finished yet and neither was the book.  If you are not into sciency stuff then I recommend skimming through towards the latter part of the book, but if you even have a minimal interest in the sciences, get ready for an introduction to a brand new scientific paradigm, then follow the author as he examines the Laws of Thermodynamics and even the Laws of Conservation and meets them head on!  Of course, a new scientific paradigm has to include at least a new formula or two so checking this out is a must!  If you like talking, writing, and reading between the lines as I do, you might really get a kick out of this book and here is your first hint:

The Real Future of Green Energy

 
It is no big surprise that energy is one of the hottest topics on the planet today. You don’t have to look far to find opinions, insight, and a boatload of comments about what’s good, what’s bad, and what many think we really should be doing.  What we don’t see, read, or hear about, however, is the real solution.  If I surprise only a few people here it will still put a big grin on my face, but I hope to surprise many of you by finally revealing the answer to the world’s energy problem(s).

 
First . . . we are going to get rid of a buzz word and add another, and then another.  We nix Alternative and add Primary.  Renewable is the ultimate answer so the new buzz phrase is Independently Renewable.  Our wonderful new solution to the energy challenge does not involve fossil fuels, wind power, solar panels, batteries, garbage, corn, or algae.  Since this brand new primary source of energy is independently renewable, we can build it where the wind doesn’t blow and put it where the sun doesn’t shine . . . and it’s also relatively inexpensive on a larger scale so we can retrofit existing power plants, build new ones, and eventually get rid of all the old, unsightly transmission lines.  
If this all sounds too good, it’s actually even better.  Not only is it real and coming soon to the air near you,  it will someday mean no more gas for your car and no more diesel for your truck or cargo ship.  I can’t say much about the mechanics of this process or even the new scientific paradigm, but a few of the carefully selected professors, engineers, and physicists who have already been involved are scratching their heads at how easy it turned out to be.  

 
For those who might still be a little skeptical . . .  well, we’ve heard from you before and we all know what a van Gogh is going for these days, so I suggest you use caution in your comments and hold tight.  Once the word is out, some will be quite disappointed that they missed the obvious and others will wish they had thought of it first.  What really matters, however, is that the solution is finally here and that we field this kicker technology as soon as possible!  The ball is already rolling and you can soon expect to breathe a little easier, so start getting ready for the real future of green energy.

Our Story
My grandmother loves to tell stories and she has a lot of them. As a retired nurse, her stories can range from funny to sad. A few years ago, she started writing the story of her father who worked as a sharecropper in South Carolina, took the midnight train to NYC, worked as a janitor in Manhattan for years and finally moved his family of 9 children and his wife to their very own home in Brooklyn.

After spending days typing it out on her typewriter, she has been asking for the last three years to have it compiled the way she wrote it into book form. I have been saying forever that I would get it done. Now is the time.


The Impact
The publication of this book will greatly affect my family and the larger community as a whole.

1) My grandmother is getting up in years and I would love to surprise her with real copies of her book for her to cherish for the rest of her days. It would also be of great importance to have the story of my great grandfather passed down for generations to come.

2)Though this is a personal story of one man, it represents the wider, less told story of black Americans moving from the bottoms of the South to make a way for themselves by capturing the American Dream in the North, known as the Great Migration. This movement helped determine the make up of modern cities and suburbs. I will be donating copies of the book to libraries for the community to enjoy and gain awareness.


What We Need & What You Get
I have decided against entering the world of publishing by choosing a self-publishing service. As much as I would love to get this book printed on my own, I do not have the editing skills nor the funds to make this book a reality in the near future. 

This is where you come in. With your contributions, I can obtain professional help from start to finish, including:


Cover Design

Formatting

Editing

100 paperback and 25 hardcover copies to start with

The ability to create an ebook version, obtain an ISBN, and sell the book on sites like amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com




The cost of this service is $5,000.

Help this dream become a reality in the next two months. 

If we do not receive all the funds needed to obtain these professional services, the amount received will go toward publishing on a lower level. Meaning, we will still publish this book but the time factor will push the production back considerably.

If we raise more than the $5,000 needed, we will purchase more copies of the books and mail them out to libraries and other interested parties all over the country. The extra funds will cover the cost of production and mailing services.

As a sponsor of this project, you will receive perks. Please check out the list to your right and choose your gift amount today.

<p>The funding, Indiegogo’s minimum $500 campaign, will go toward covering some of the costs connected with my becoming a professional novelist:  membership in a professional writer’s association and submission costs (associated with  submitting  work to writers’ contests as well as prospective  agents and publishers).  Additional funds raised, if any, will go toward continuing education to develop my fiction-writing skills, the assistance of a professional editor to help me sharpen my writing even more, the creation of an author website, the purchase of a new computer (I'm on a hand-me-down computer six years old with a host of ... let’s call them ‘quirks’), and the publication of new books.<br/><br/><br/>Why Help?</p>
<p>We Angel Ladies have done a lot of writing.  We’ve written articles for the Toronto Star, local newspapers and magazines, webzines, and our own free ezine and newsletter.  We’ve written two books for the Dundurn Group (Angels Help Us: Discovering Divine Guidance, and Psychics and Mediums in Canada).   Although I've dedicated myself to the spiritual and uplifting work of the Angel Ladies, helping people find and live their dreams, I have the heart of a storyteller.<br/><br/>Almost year ago,  we realized that part of my life purpose was to write the stories that came to me - funny stories, touching stories, stories that entertained and uplifted at the same time.  I have a novel I've been developing in my head for more than ten years; I began  writing it.  Now, over one hundred thousand words later, the first draft is finished.  <br/><br/>I've been writing all my life.  English teachers loved me - telling me I was talented, that my work showed a spark that was  impossible to teach.  My friends were eager to read the latest  works.  In university, my writing professors praised my work enthusiastically.<br/><br/>As an Angel Lady, I wrote to assist people to find greater joy and satisfaction in life. I counseled them, helping them to find their own life purposes, knowing that living one’s life purpose  brings joy and spiritual centeredness.  Always, my stories lived in my head and I promised them that one day, I’d give them life.<br/><br/>That time is now.  It’s my turn to live my own dream. My  story is written, ready to begin its journey to publication as a  book–if I can find the resources to do so.<br/><br/>At this point, I need the help of professionals to edit and  ready my work for commercial publishers.  If I choose to self-publish my work, it would be even more important to enlist the help of editors and graphic designers to prepare my work, publishing costs for hard  copies, and web assistance to format my work for e-readers.  <br/><br/>That will take more money than the I can afford, and so we  have begun this campaign to help me realize a dream of my own: to be a published novelist, the author of novels that  entertain and delight readers, novels that feature women who are not only strong but wise and kind, novels that bring more fun and happiness into the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thank You!</p>

<h3>About this project</h3>
<p class=""Body"">This translation project of 12 short stories from Cambodian to English is organized by the  <a href=""http://www.nouhachjournal.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Nou Hach Journal"">Nou Hach Literary Association</a> in Phnom Penh, which  was started in 2002 with the intent to support writers and literary publishing in Cambodia.  During 1975-79 over 90 percent of writers and intellectuals were killed by the Khmer Rouge or died from starvation and exposure.   Writers still struggle to publish  in Cambodia due to publishing costs and the pirating of creative work in the unregulated market here.  They also struggle with one of the highest rates of illiteracy in Asia and a language yet to be significantly modernized making it more challenging to read. </p>
<p class=""Body"">As a founding member of the association, I have assisted in the development of Cambodian literature with Khmer writers since 2002.  I am part of the Nou Hach translation team and travel to Cambodia for several months every summer to help organize the annual writers conference and smaller  writers workshops with our Asialink writers-in-residence interns from Australia.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Cambodia lags behind the rest of Asia in translations of Khmer fiction and poetry. In fact, ""Just a Human Being..."" will be the first collection of short fiction in English translation from Cambodia. The stories in this collection include tales of poverty, social injustice, political corruption and the triumph of karma and compassion. The twelve stories in ""Just a Human Being..."" represent the best work of contemporary Cambodian writers in the genre of serious fiction.</p>
<p>There are no creative writing programs in Cambodia.  The language still exhibits strong influence from Pali and Sanskrit, meaning that one “idea” can be an entire paragraph without a stop indicating our period.  There are still problems with  standardized spelling.  In any case, the young writers in this collection are not only the most creative writers in Cambodia today, they are also associated with a clarity of Khmer writing and editing.  This collection of their work in translation will bring attention to the importance of new writing in Cambodia.</p>
<p>As the project director for the Nou Hach Literary Association, I have facilitated the publication of six Nou Hach journal volumes.  My own publications include ""Virtual Lotus: Modern Fiction of Southeast Asia"" (University of Michigan Press, 2002) and ""Modern Short Fiction of Southeast Asia: A Literary History"" (Association for Asian Studies, 2009).  I am deeply invested in the development of modern literature in Cambodia.</p>

I did most of my reading on a fishing boat in Alaska; Ken Kesey, Charles Bukowski, John Fante,  Kirk Vonnegut were my favorites.  

WRITING A BOOK, HIPPIE? IS COMPLETE, EDITED, ENDORSED AND READY FOR MARKET
 Below is a synopsis of the completed work which has been endorsed with a 'thumbs up' by a well known published American writer and a friend.  


Bryan Conley
showcases bitter-sweet prose
in his first
literary work â€œWriting a Book, Hippie?â€ 
The story tells a true and adventurous journey
of a young manâ€™s
trek to Alaskaâ€™s Inside Passage.
 
The completed inspiration
derives itself 
some 20 years
later after recent, less fortunate
adventures
occur, for which Conley provides his 
audience a sense
of time travel by using dream
 states referred to as â€˜series of million year napsâ€™.
 
While the story
builds, fragile social angles attach 
themselves with
unequalled imagination for
 the reader. 
The apparent suggestions and looks 
provide a
personal understanding of a larger picture. 
 
His contemporary
insight into tragedy, kindness,
and the
undeniable over analysis featured front 
to back deliver this
unique take on contemplating 
the human
condition in a traditional beat poet style.

 Funding for this project will support the much needed marketing expansion.  All sales proceeds will further encourage my goals for the consecutive publications in this 3 book seriesHERE'S AN EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK:

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>I launched my debut YA fantasy novel, Chasing Fae, with a presale campaign on IndieGoGo, ending with its publication in August 2020. Grace Richardson’s journey to uncover the secrets of her older brother’s death in the Fae world started off with a bang. Readers have been hooked on her honest, impulsive nature and the twists and turns that I set up for her in the debut. Now I am ready to continue that journey with a whole new volume. </p>
<p>From the second I finished the first draft of Chasing Fae in 2018, I was ready to write Chasing War. As a sequel, I knew I had to make the story something special. To me, sequels need to not just carry on from the first book, but bring new layers to the characters and the world. There should also be something unexpected, something that jolts the reader and makes them read furiously to see how it all plays out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - Chasing War</h3>
<p>Chasing War picks up right where Chasing Fae left off with Grace taking her new place in the Upper Realm. Spoilers from here on in. When Grace arrives at the House of the Evening, she is instantly thrust into the world of the nobility. As the heir to a throne she didn’t even realize was hers, she has to navigate magical education, dangerous politics, and a stepfamily she never asked for. With her tutor, Talon, and Aiden by her side, Grace steps out into the Upper Realm only to find a war exploding under her gaze led by the House of Darkness. She and Aiden must quickly strategize against the invaders while searching in earnest for the remaining six prophecy members. As the war rages on and more pieces of the puzzle fall into place, Grace must make a decision about who to trust and how to lead.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is my first book that I am publishing entirely by myself without the aid of a small press. I set up the preorder tiers to help cover the costs for publishing and its many facets. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copyeditor: To help me refine the story to its best form</li>
<li>A proofreader: To polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>A cover designer: The mockups you are seeing are a placeholder! I will need a fantastic fantasy cover for both the ebook and paperback forms of Chasing War. </li>
<li>A formatter: To create the interior formatting for the book</li>
<li>ISBNs: I need a batch of ISBN numbers in order to get this book distributed widely. </li>
<li>Book Printing and Shipping: To send all of your books out to you!</li>
</ul>
<p>I need 127 copies sold in order to launch this book fully. </p>
<p>I am offering some exclusive rewards for people who preorder my book NOW to help it launch:</p>

<p>Cady loves to create stories that take people away from the world for a while.

It also touches on subjects about drug addiction, loneliness, and how ALL lives truly matter. <br/><br/>Part 5 contains interviews conducted with dozens of people, their perspective on the subjects introduced in the chapters beforehand, and differing opinions to see what the world has to say about motivation and inspiration and it’s impact on their life. </p><p>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</p><p><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

I wrote this book because I wanted to leave this world a little bit better than I found it.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what it means to live a life of meaning and to stand for something. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for YOUR LIFE . And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you take back control of your life and see the little things, for that is what makes life meaningful.In this book, you'll learn about Motivation and Inspiration through:Personal accounts of people with near death experiences and their takeaway from itWhat it means to truly live life to the fullest, each and every day!!What it really takes to survive in this brave new world, how to thrive and go about each day like it’s your lastI can’t promise you’ll love this book, hell even like this book. I can promise that there will be many things you can take away from it to help you in the long run of your life. You will learn things you never knew, see things you’ve never seen, and do things you’ve never done just because you read this book and you took action in your life. So what are you waiting for? The Fire to Inspire is a non-fiction book that speaks to everyone and anyone who is looking at their life and may be happy or unhappy. While this book won’t solve every problem, it will help you see the world differently and realize that not everything is as it seems and show you that life really is simple. Just like Florida Georgia Line says. The Book - “The Fire to Inspire”The book is written in 5 Parts....Part 1 starts off with the introduction and explains what motivation and inspiration can do for you, my definition of it, and a little bit about me, my past, and my future. Part 2 contains stories about using motivation to your advantage, creating an impact on this world and really making a difference in not only your life, but the lives of those around you. Part 3 talks about how to lead in this crazy world we find ourselves in, using empathy and perspective to create balance in the workplace, living a life worth living, and many, many other things. Part 4 introduces the educational system, it’s ups and downs, and some fixes on how to help struggling kids. It also touches on subjects about drug addiction, loneliness, and how ALL lives truly matter. Part 5 contains interviews conducted with dozens of people, their perspective on the subjects introduced in the chapters beforehand, and differing opinions to see what the world has to say about motivation and inspiration and it’s impact on their life. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following: The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December, 2020The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publicationThe Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this December!!! HOAHHHHWhen I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook. So let’s get crack-a-lackin and read read read, (Spoiler, it may be addicting)I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:A personally signed copy of my book when I publishA personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my bookYour Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)Early access to the Introduction of my Book and some additional sections of my manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedbackThe opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my coverI will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my bookWhoever pre-orders the book will be entered in a contest where three (3) will be randomly selected to be able to interview me.Everyone that pre-orders the book will be entered to win a $50 gift card to a restaurant of their choice, and if they want I’ll take them out to eat.

Firstly, it demonstrated on-time delivery of a Kickstarter, which is an increasingly rare treat in this day and age. Secondly, it established a standard of quality. Hard bound editions of Part 1 of <em><strong>Through the Moongate</strong></em>, were packaged in custom fitted mailers and shrink wrapped before shipping, ensuring backers received exactly what they paid for.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The risk is very low. Through the Moongate, Part 2 is already completely written in Italian, and the editing and the translation into English are underway. After that, all that is left to do is printing the book and shipping it to our backers.</p>
<p>Through the Moongate, Part 1 has been successfully kickstarted in October 2018 and was shipped in the promised timeframe.</p>
<p>As a proof of the quality of Andrea's work, we decided to show a full chapter as a preview, so that you can evaluate yourself if it's worth your time and money.</p>
</div></div>","This is the follow up of the Kickstarter campaign. Funds collected on Kickstarter will be added to those collected on IndieGogo In-demand to reach all available stretch goals.Greetings, traveller!If you’ve ever played a computer role-playing game (CRPG), chances are that Ultima played a part in its inspiration. Created by visionary Richard Garriott, and produced by his company Origin Systems, Inc., Ultima is one of the most important and influential CRPG series in the world. Through the Moongate illuminates the path of the Ultima games' history and the creative people behind this landmark series. It also covers some of Origin's other games, especially Wing Commander, and touches on several contemporary titles you may have missed. Many of these exciting tales have never before been told. If that intrigues you, then won’t you step with me...The ProjectThrough the Moongate is the ambitious two-volume comprehensive history of the Ultima series, Lord British, and Origin Systems at-large. Part I was successfully Kickstarted on October 16th, 2018 and covered Richard Garriott’s humble beginnings up through Ultima VI. Part II covers Ultima VII to Portalarium and includes Wing Commander and other important Origin titles.You can find the complete index for both Part 1 and Part 2 here as well as more information on the project as a whole.Why Kickstarter and IndieGogo?This crowdfunding is to fund the translation and printing of Part II, which is already finished in Italian and ready to go. For more information about the campaign, read on!Through the Moongate aims to be a more complete account of Origin's history than has ever been presented before. Parts of Origin and Richard Garriott's story have been included in other works such as The Official Book of Ultima by Shay Addams and Garriott's own memoir, Explore/Create, but this book is a comprehensive work of new research. In the process, I interviewed dozens of people who were crucial to Origin's success and given them a voice. While many of these contributors worked directly for Origin, NCSoft, and Portalarium, others influenced the world of Ultima and Origin Systems in other creative ways. These developers, artists, and others have helped to shed new light on Origin's fascinating story and I’m excited to share it with you.As I traced the paths of the Ultima games and those who worked for Origin Systems, I began to realize the multitude of games that would not be possible without the influence of Richard Garriott, Origin Systems, and the Ultima series. To ensure their place in history, I've also included special coverage of the Wing Commander and Ultima Underworld series, plus other significant video games of the era. CRPGs, action, adventure, and strategy games such as Space Rogue, Wolfenstein 3D, Deathlord, 7th guest, Jane's Combat series, OMEGA, MUD1, Meridian 59, Lineage, and Tabula Rasa. I’ve also included a special look at cancelled titles such as Times of Lore 2 and Fire Horse.Through the Moongate: Part 1 - From Akalabeth to Ultima VI was successfully funded through Kickstarter in October 2018 and shipped on time in July 2019.Part 1 set several important precedents. Firstly, it demonstrated on-time delivery of a Kickstarter, which is an increasingly rare treat in this day and age. Secondly, it established a standard of quality. Hard bound editions of Part 1 of Through the Moongate, were packaged in custom fitted mailers and shrink wrapped before shipping, ensuring backers received exactly what they paid for. Several unboxing videos and posts reveal delight in how well everything fits, especially those backers who opted for the magnetically closing black box.If you missed the Kickstarter for Part 1, don’t fret! You can opt for a tier with both books or write an email to me, the author, to get the first book as soon as possible and read it to decide if you wish to support Part 2. I sincerely hope that you will! This campaign's aim is to translate, edit, and print Through the Moongate: Part 2 - From Wing Commander and Ultima VII to Portalarium. Part 2 will bring you the same quality you’ve come to expect from Part 1 with some additional improvements including native English copy editing and exciting new backer rewards.Part 2 of Through the Moongate will be available in three different editions: Digital, Soft Cover, and Hard Cover. The hardbound edition, the flagship edition of this Kickstarter, will feature photographs from Richard Garriott's personal archive and Enrico Ricciardi's collection of Ultima games. Additionally, it will showcase brand new commissioned artwork by ex-Originite, Manda on the rear cover and a stunning new moongate image by Enrico Ricciardi for the front cover to match Part I!We decided to print it here in Italy to ensure that the overall quality of the printing process would be easy for us to control directly. We care deeply about the special editions and we want it to be of the very highest, impeccable quality. The softcover edition will be available in two languages: English and Italian. Both versions will be printed in Italy and shipped to the backers. At the end of the Kickstarter, you'll receive a survey request and you'll be able to select the language of the book. The hardbound edition will be printed only in English.Shipping: International shipping and tracking globally is available at different levels of detail. Some tracking services give information only until the package reaches the international drop point while others follow the package all the way until delivery. If you cannot find your country, contact us and will add the option for you. While our primary goal is to ensure that Part II comes to fruition, there were a few extra nice-to-haves that we cut to keep the budget realistic. If we surpass our funding goal, some of these trimmed features can return!When determining our minimum funding goal, we had to consider several elements. Here is the ultimate breakdown of our budget. We did our best to lower our costs as much as possible to produce a reasonable funding goal without sacrificing the final quality of the book.To write this book, I had the opportunity to interview the programmers, artists, designers, managers, and musicians that took part in the epic story of Origin Systems and worked with Richard Garriott in creating his ambitious games. The following amazing characters are directly quoted in my book:While many fantastic people played a role in getting us here today, our staff officially comprises Andrea Contato, Enrico Ricciardi, and Edward Vitralis. No project would be possible without a long list of special people who deserve recognition and appreciation. This Kickstarter would be possible without the help from the following people:

Richard Garriott de Cayeux for not only creating the worlds that we play in, but for his unending support of fan projects more than three decades later.

Denis Loubet & Manda for their brilliant artwork in Part I and their yet-to-be-created illustrations for Part II

The Space Bards/Recap & The Hearth of Britannia for creating and allowing the use of the “Theme for Rabbling” in our Kickstarter video.

Richard Pickles for porting Akalabeth to the Vectrex and for general project consultation.

Kenneth Kully and Dominik Reichardt for proofreading and general project consultation.

Jarrod Kailef for the outstanding teaser trailer made in record time.

Shannon Smith for the incredible moongate artwork used in the section headings.

All backers from the first Kickstarter. We wouldn’t be here today without your support.
Lastly, anyone who shared, reviewed, or otherwise spread the word and believed in this project. Your support means the world to us.
Follow our Facebook page, explore the official home page for the full index and information on the book, cool trivia and more, or feel free to contact me on Facebook, Twitter or directly through Kickstarter.Still on the fence about whether or not this book is for you? Download and peruse this free sample chapter from Part I of Through the Moongate. We hope you enjoy it!
 
Risks and challenges
The risk is very low. Through the Moongate, Part 2 is already completely written in Italian, and the editing and the translation into English are underway. After that, all that is left to do is printing the book and shipping it to our backers.
Through the Moongate, Part 1 has been successfully kickstarted in October 2018 and was shipped in the promised timeframe.
As a proof of the quality of Andrea's work, we decided to show a full chapter as a preview, so that you can evaluate yourself if it's worth your time and money.",30.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3></h3>
<p>If you're anything like us, you're getting tired of the same old alphabet books where A is for Apple and B is for...BORING! We're trying to raise $6000 to publish The Awful Alphabet, an amazing new way for children to learn their ABCs! Using humour and imaginative graphics, the book also realistically points out that sometimes things just don't go our way (Ever swallowed a watermelon seed and worry about the plant growing in your belly? Or have you thought about the repercussions of being friends with a Yeti)?</p>
<p>This book is an important learning tool for kids because it not only teaches them the alphabet, but it also focuses on subject matter that can help build resilience at a young age. This can help them to better cope with a wide range of emotions as they grow up!</p>

Thanks to all of your fantastic support, we've reached 100% of our minimum funding goal! We've prepared some stretch goals to make the book even more awful than we ever thought possible! All funds raised are going to the book entirely. We've even decided to add a couple of surprise pages to the book as a thank you for your awesome support that we will pay for ourselves. They include new artwork, poetry and more! So take a peek at our stretch goals and let's finish with a bang. Thank you to all of our awful supporters. 

STRETCH GOALS!




*Spot Varnish is a glossy coating on select areas of the hardcover. We want to up the awful by making the rain on the cover actually look like wet, cold rain! Here is a link to a good description of Spot UV Varnish as well as some examples. I've included a nice article about End Papers. 
Make it rain! Poor sad boy.

In Support of Nkosi's Haven




Aside from supporting our dream of publishing this book, you'll also be helping children in need achieve their education. For every book sold in this limited edition run, we will donate $1 to Nkosi's Haven in Johannesburg, South Africa. Nkosi's Haven is a long term care facility for women and children affected by HIV & AIDS. They do amazing work providing holistic care and a supportive home for those in need.


The 3 months Tracy spent working there opened her eyes to the challenges an NGO must face when trying to not only fund a happy home for so many children, but also, very importantly, their educations. Children are our future and helping them gain the best education possible is an important cause that we are proud to support and we hope you are too. Find out more information and learn Nkosi's story below.

<p>I am a twenty-six year old student, studying linguistics (in hopes of 
becoming a dialect coach). I am currently a smoker of about six years, 
but I also spend my time knitting, crocheting, writing, drawing, hanging
 out with friends, amongst other things that your average mid-twenty 
something year old would do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Six months ago I decided to take a risk by starting <a href=""http://rhodesthroughthesmoke.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rhodes Through the Smoke</a>, 
sharing my experiences as a smoker, my questions, research, and my 
thought process throughout while hoping to engage others in the topic as
 well.</p>
<p>My main reason for doing so was to help show the other side of 
smoking, from a smoker’s perspective. I feel most conversations are 
about how bad it is for you and are often very negative, not allowing 
constructive progress. </p>
<p>My hope is not to glorify smoking or downplay its risks, but when it 
comes to different types of addictions or struggles they should be 
talked about, the good, the bad, and the ugly.</p>
<p>I had no idea how this blog would be received, but I have been 
pleasantly surprised by the responses, comments, messages, and links 
shared with me. </p>
<p>To give you an update on how far this blog has come in the last six 
months, there are almost 30 posts, 23 comments, 21 followers, and close 
to 1500 total views. This may not sound like a lot, but I think this is 
only the beginning. </p>
<p>I have high hopes and aspirations for where this blog can go, 
ultimately wanting to help others. Whether that is as an outlet for them
 to talk about a subject they might feel uncomfortable talking about, 
providing insight to those who may be unfamiliar with these experiences 
or afraid to ask smokers that they know,  and being able to give 
research, statistics, options for quitting, and so much more.</p>
<p>Without all of you, this would just be a place for me to share my own opinions, but you all have made it so much more. </p>
<p>These last six months have been some what of a trial run to see if there
 is an audience interested in this topic. Fortunately, I believe there 
is, and in wanting to offer the most to this audience, I believe it is 
time to upgrade in order to expand.<br/></p>
<p>I would like to ask you to help me make this blog even more than it 
is now, by taking a moment to check out our campaign to expand to our 
own domain name with resources to expand. You can find the link at the

<p>With that said, if we earn over what we need to meet our current goal, I want to share with you some of the ideas on how Through the Smoke will continue to expand and giveback.</p>

</div><br/></div>","Why is the need so urgent? 
The global economy is clearly out of balance and out of control.  The current decline in our national civility along with public and private morality seemed inconceivable a few short years ago.  People are abandoning their faith - no longer willing to stand and work for a brighter future.  We face tough economic times just ahead that will seriously compound an already uncertain outlook.  When Harbingers Abound will pull back the veil and interpret current events from a biblical world view.  It may feel like you have just awakened from a deep sleep.  Suddenly you will see a hundred things in a different light with no clue where to start.  This is a guidebook chock full of practical steps that will serve as a outline for you and your loved ones to get prepared. 
Your call to action is here!

The urgency of this situation calls for some innovative thinking! The traditional 18-month publishing cycle won't get it done fast enough.  We need to get this book in print NOW and we need your help to do it!  The manuscript is a mere weeks from completion.  We need our Indiegogo partners (Your name here: X_________).  If we join forces now, we can cut the printing and distribution time to less than 3 months  


Where will the $6000 be used

Phase One starts  right away and when we reach $3000,  the final edit will be completed and an initial print run will begin.  We will begin shipping the finished book to our Indiegogo partners as the first copies are available.  Our target for that phase is August 2015.  (***update - we can now begin Phase 1 when we reach $2000! We found a better publisher***)
Phase 2 will be contract publication and distribution through major outlets like Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Ingram and others. This will take an additional several weeks to set up.  That's also when the eBook version should be completed and available. You can watch for updates here and on our Facebook page:

https://www.facebook.com/pages/When-Harbingers-Abound/468600619966781
Here's a list of where the money will be allocated:



Complete the final manuscript and pay for initial print run so campaign partners get their copies in hand first.
Contract with a major publisher for volume printing, marketing, and sale through major  distributors like Amazon and other traditional retail outlets.
Provide some cool perks for our Contribution Partners.
Prepare an eBook
     electronic version for electronic distribution
Establish a website to further promote
     and distribute the book 
Prepare select videos to promote the book and its message of hope.
Set aside some complimentary copies for distribution as needed.
No author salary is included.  If it sells I get paid. If not, at least I finished it!




What are the risks?

There are risks in everything we do.  That's the price of progress.  The risks here are pretty straightforward...
Getting the book finished - I am so concerned about getting this message out that I am taking a sabbatical to get it completed and edited.  I plan to have the second half finished by early August and minimize any risky behavior in the meantime {8>0
What if we don't reach our goal quickly - Publication will proceed in direct proportion to the rate we can raise funds.  We move forward in small steps as each phase gets funded.  Since time is of the essence, each day of delay will mean fewer days for new readers to get positioned.   Send this link to your friends with a personal appeal.

Rutinas de hormiga. Arrastran sus pequeños cuerpos y los devuelven al final del día, aún más pequeños, encogidos, eufóricos de cansancio los viernes por la tarde. Intentan olvidar el lunes con alcohol y drogas y risas agrias. Para la mayoría, siempre es lunes y siempre lo será. El primero y el único día, al acecho como un ave carroñera volando en círculos sobre la cabeza del animal moribundo.<br/>     Vueltas y vueltas. Todo vuelve a empezar»</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Hoy es lunes. Un grupo de mujeres con pañuelo ceñido alrededor del rostro. La cabeza sobre los hombros y el pelo bien protegido. El mar y la brisa no traen más que polvo y suciedad. Cruzan el descampado ante el enorme edificio en construcción, casi un rascacielos, por ahora un esqueleto de hierro y hormigón. Entran en la fábrica de lavadoras AEG. Se quitan el pañuelo y lo sacuden. Una vez, otra vez, y al bolsillo. Se cambian en el vestuario de mujeres. Dejan el abrigo y se enfundan sus batas, azules o blancas. Adelante. La cadena circula a su ritmo. A su ritmo. Una pieza, otra pieza, otra pieza. Luego descanso. Una pieza, otra pieza más. Encajan piezas y siguen encajando todo el santo día. Florencia encaja en la cadena, una trabajadora más venida del más allá. En Uruguay era otra cosa. Auxiliar de enfermería en el hospital Pereira Rossell de Montevideo, con perspectivas, un marido, un hijo. Se fue todo al garete. Ella, Florencia, se fue. Nunca había llegado tan lejos. Cruzó el océano, la inmensidad. Ahora cruza el descampado todos los días, protegiéndose el pelo con un pañuelo ceñido. La tela sobre las orejas amortigua los gritos y las risas, amortigua murmullos incómodos, recurrentes. Están ahí y ella no puede más que callar para contenerlos, sin demasiado éxito»</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Era rumano cuando vivía en Rumania. En España no es español. Ni siquiera es europeo. Es un extranjero, un simple extranjero rumano en España. Algo a lo que se acostumbró muy rápido. Como si una vez rotos los vínculos con todo lo que dejó atrás, su condición no representara más que un espejismo, un encuentro fugaz, intrascendente, e impuesto por fuerzas que escapan a su control.<br/>     Ahora Nicolae ni siquiera recuerda el olor de su tierra. Era verde y olía, eso sí lo recuerda. Olía a tierra verde, a hogar. Campos, prados y bosques, pueblos y ciudades. Caballos trotando sobre el suelo embarrado. Un gallo que canta. El ruido del hacha sobre el tronco, que cruje al partirse, que crepitará después presa del fuego en la chimenea. Todo eso era suyo aunque no le perteneciera. En realidad, empezó a ser suyo al alejarse, y cuanto más se alejaba más suyo era.<br/>     El mar le recuerda su tierra.<br/>     Le recuerda el despertar por la mañana, mirar por la ventana al saltar de la cama en su habitación, ver la hierba impregnada por las gotas de rocío, abrir, coger aire y exhalar con fuerza, el ritual necesario para afrontar un nuevo día. Es un recuerdo al revés. Es un olor tan diferente, el del mar, que le hace sentir la ausencia con mayor intensidad. No olía así, piensa, no olía así. ¿Cómo era? ¿Cómo olía mi tierra desde mi ventana? Es el recuerdo del olvido, recordar que se ha perdido aquello que se abandona. Por eso no le gusta la playa, cuya arena se extiende a sus pies como un manto arrugado y sucio. Mira de reojo mientras coloca ladrillos, uno tras otro, levantando un muro con el que poder protegerse»</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«En el mar, el pescador lanza sus redes. En su barca, la barca de Alfonso, que es suya como lo fue siempre. Su tripulación, cada vez más mermada hasta convertirse en la nada, él mismo, solo, ante todo y contra todo. Mozos, marineros e incluso pescadores curtidos desertan a la búsqueda de lo que el mar no puede darles. Se convierten en albañiles, encofradores, electricistas, plomeros o simples peones a la espera de una prosperidad que es anhelo más que promesa. Una nueva vida en tierra firme. Para él, el trabajo se multiplica. La pesca, no.<br/>     Antes sí.<br/>     Antes tenía familia, tenía mar. No hace mucho tiempo. Había pesca, y barcos, y capitanes que regresaban con las bodegas repletas. Alfonso se acuerda del brillo sobre la cubierta, de la fascinación en los ojos de niños y curiosos, de los peces deslizándose por el suelo entre las botas negras porque no cabían en las cajas. Hombres rudos con gorro de lana, como él, alegres y trabajadores, como él, siempre ajetreados. Entonces lo eran. Pescadores orgullosos de su esfuerzo, de su sudor, del hedor que arrastraban después de una dura jornada bregando sin descanso.<br/>     El mar se fue secando, como las personas a su alrededor»</p><h3>¿Cómo?</h3><p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p><ul>

Comenzó a escribir por esa época, publicando en fanzines musicales y en la sección de cine de la revista Mondo Sonoro. Tuvo un papel activo en el movimiento antiglobalización y el movimiento antiguerra a principios del siglo XXI, y fue militante del sindicato de Técnicos del Audiovisual y del Cine en Madrid. Durante su época de activista escribió para el periódico En lucha y formó parte de su comité de redacción. También ha sido editor de la revista La Hiedra, donde publicó numerosos artículos, reseñas y columnas de opinión. Actualmente colabora en la revista Viento Sur y en la sección cultural de la web Poder Popular.Entre sus trabajos cinematográficos destacan largometrajes de ficción y documental como La mano azul de Floreal Peleato, Canción perdida de Nacho Sirera, Las olas y Los chicos del puerto de Alberto Moráis, Nadar y Volar de Carla Subirana. Ha colaborado como docente en el Curso de Animación Experimental de la UCM, en la Universidad de Málaga y en el Master de Documental de Creación de la UPF de Barcelona.Escribe poemas para la obra de la artista visual Mónica Oliva Lozano, y en 2014 publicó su primer libro con la editorial Amargord, un poemario titulado El rostro oculto. La Paja es su primera novela.Más información y algunos textos:http://elfondodelaire.blogspot.com.es/¿Por qué?Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:«Más allá de la A-31, la autovía que sitia la ciudad, los jóvenes, y no tan jóvenes, desfilan hacia las fábricas en los polígonos, restos de una prosperidad industrial que se estancó años atrás. Rutinas de hormiga. Arrastran sus pequeños cuerpos y los devuelven al final del día, aún más pequeños, encogidos, eufóricos de cansancio los viernes por la tarde. Intentan olvidar el lunes con alcohol y drogas y risas agrias. Para la mayoría, siempre es lunes y siempre lo será. El primero y el único día, al acecho como un ave carroñera volando en círculos sobre la cabeza del animal moribundo.     Vueltas y vueltas. Todo vuelve a empezar»«Hoy es lunes. Un grupo de mujeres con pañuelo ceñido alrededor del rostro. La cabeza sobre los hombros y el pelo bien protegido. El mar y la brisa no traen más que polvo y suciedad. Cruzan el descampado ante el enorme edificio en construcción, casi un rascacielos, por ahora un esqueleto de hierro y hormigón. Entran en la fábrica de lavadoras AEG. Se quitan el pañuelo y lo sacuden. Una vez, otra vez, y al bolsillo. Se cambian en el vestuario de mujeres. Dejan el abrigo y se enfundan sus batas, azules o blancas. Adelante. La cadena circula a su ritmo. A su ritmo. Una pieza, otra pieza, otra pieza. Luego descanso. Una pieza, otra pieza más. Encajan piezas y siguen encajando todo el santo día. Florencia encaja en la cadena, una trabajadora más venida del más allá. En Uruguay era otra cosa. Auxiliar de enfermería en el hospital Pereira Rossell de Montevideo, con perspectivas, un marido, un hijo. Se fue todo al garete. Ella, Florencia, se fue. Nunca había llegado tan lejos. Cruzó el océano, la inmensidad. Ahora cruza el descampado todos los días, protegiéndose el pelo con un pañuelo ceñido. La tela sobre las orejas amortigua los gritos y las risas, amortigua murmullos incómodos, recurrentes. Están ahí y ella no puede más que callar para contenerlos, sin demasiado éxito»«Era rumano cuando vivía en Rumania. En España no es español. Ni siquiera es europeo. Es un extranjero, un simple extranjero rumano en España. Algo a lo que se acostumbró muy rápido. Como si una vez rotos los vínculos con todo lo que dejó atrás, su condición no representara más que un espejismo, un encuentro fugaz, intrascendente, e impuesto por fuerzas que escapan a su control.     Ahora Nicolae ni siquiera recuerda el olor de su tierra. Era verde y olía, eso sí lo recuerda. Olía a tierra verde, a hogar. Campos, prados y bosques, pueblos y ciudades. Caballos trotando sobre el suelo embarrado. Un gallo que canta. El ruido del hacha sobre el tronco, que cruje al partirse, que crepitará después presa del fuego en la chimenea. Todo eso era suyo aunque no le perteneciera. En realidad, empezó a ser suyo al alejarse, y cuanto más se alejaba más suyo era.     El mar le recuerda su tierra.     Le recuerda el despertar por la mañana, mirar por la ventana al saltar de la cama en su habitación, ver la hierba impregnada por las gotas de rocío, abrir, coger aire y exhalar con fuerza, el ritual necesario para afrontar un nuevo día. Es un recuerdo al revés. Es un olor tan diferente, el del mar, que le hace sentir la ausencia con mayor intensidad. No olía así, piensa, no olía así. ¿Cómo era? ¿Cómo olía mi tierra desde mi ventana? Es el recuerdo del olvido, recordar que se ha perdido aquello que se abandona. Por eso no le gusta la playa, cuya arena se extiende a sus pies como un manto arrugado y sucio. Mira de reojo mientras coloca ladrillos, uno tras otro, levantando un muro con el que poder protegerse»«En el mar, el pescador lanza sus redes. En su barca, la barca de Alfonso, que es suya como lo fue siempre. Su tripulación, cada vez más mermada hasta convertirse en la nada, él mismo, solo, ante todo y contra todo. Mozos, marineros e incluso pescadores curtidos desertan a la búsqueda de lo que el mar no puede darles. Se convierten en albañiles, encofradores, electricistas, plomeros o simples peones a la espera de una prosperidad que es anhelo más que promesa. Una nueva vida en tierra firme. Para él, el trabajo se multiplica. La pesca, no.     Antes sí.     Antes tenía familia, tenía mar. No hace mucho tiempo. Había pesca, y barcos, y capitanes que regresaban con las bodegas repletas. Alfonso se acuerda del brillo sobre la cubierta, de la fascinación en los ojos de niños y curiosos, de los peces deslizándose por el suelo entre las botas negras porque no cabían en las cajas. Hombres rudos con gorro de lana, como él, alegres y trabajadores, como él, siempre ajetreados. Entonces lo eran. Pescadores orgullosos de su esfuerzo, de su sudor, del hedor que arrastraban después de una dura jornada bregando sin descanso.     El mar se fue secando, como las personas a su alrededor»¿Cómo?Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.
Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.
Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de La paja que saldría después a la venta.Además...Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Manel Barriere Figueroa vea publicada su obra.Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are Carleigh and Carol: friends, professional writers and graduates of the Writer's Studio program (2012) at Simon Fraser University. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/17422/files/20130817080156-Car_and_car.jpg?1376751716"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We love our city, and we love writing, so we think it's time for Vancouver to have its own dedicated writers and readers' centre. Blumin Warehouse will be a place where writers can gather and share ideas, rent desk space at a competitive price and hold readings and workshops. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>A brief overview:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We need at least $5000 to put a month's rent down on a space. Anything we raise beyond that will go towards facility renovations.</p>
<p>***UPDATE!*** Blumin has secured enough private investment funding to rent a space! We'll be shopping around next week, and will keep you updated on the process.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the Naked
Poets campaign? Full steam ahead! Even after we've secured the space,
there's office furniture to buy, walls to paint, and wiring to run!
We could use your support more than ever! Thank you!  </p>
<p>Blumin Warehouse's rates are competitive with current co-sharing office providers, but we cater specifically to writers' needs with quiet, semi-private, customizable space.</p>
<p>We offer meeting and performance space to special-interest groups for low cost, or for work trade agreements that contribute to ongoing facility improvement.</p>
<p>We will open our doors to the public in October. </p>
<p>In the spirit of creativity, and considering Vancouver's proclivity for stripping down in the name of fundraising, we've launched the Naked Poets campaign. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>How does this campaign work?</h3>1. Donate. You can donate any amount, and you don't have to submit a poem. All donations are greatly appreciated! <p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2. If you'd like to submit a poem, choose the perk that appeals to you, donate, then post your poem in the comments section (scroll down a little after you donate, there will be a field on the thank you page that allows you to send us a direct message.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>If you forget to send us your poem immediately after donating, you can also post your poem in the comments section (look for the comments tab right above the fundraising video on this page)</b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Well, there's the obvious comparison-for a lot of writers, sharing our work is no different from baring our skin. It's that old public speaking dream, come to life. </span><br/></p>

This isn't just office space, this is writers' space. And writing involves risk. So, for our first campaign, we decided to kick things off by pushing past our own comfort zones a little. </p>

<h3>East Vancouver, where else?</h3>
<p>Did you know that East Vancouver has one of the highest concentrations of artists in the country? From Mount Pleasant to Sunrise, our neighbourhood is packed with sculptors, painters, filmmakers, graphic artists and writers. But sharing a multi-disciplinary work space has its drawbacks. Nobody wants to write next to the gal with the table saw. And the last thing the gal with the table saw needs is your attitude, mister! And so, we writers find ourselves in coffee shops, buying lattes and churros to access the WiFi or not get booted out during the busy hours. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Or maybe you are already renting space at a place like The Hive, paying a premium to be in trendy Gastown, and looking across the desk at the person working across from you. Not ideal. We may not need absolute silence while we work, but we do need a quiet, semi-private space of our own, that we can access whenever the muse calls, be it noon or 3 am. Blumin membership will guarantee you access to your own space 24 hours a day, seven days a week. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Read, write, teach, learn.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Blumin will have ample writing space, and room for book clubs and workshops. As a writer, you will be able to organize and offer workshops or book clubs. Host writing group meetings. And that's not all we've got planned for Blumin. In the next few years, we hope to expand our services to include self-publishing facilities, an online writing database and eventually, an urban writer's retreat. We are currently looking in Mount Pleasant, since these areas are accessible by transit and are already heavily populated by artists. We have received overwhelming support from everyone we`ve talked to about the project. Organizations like the Writers Studio have offered their support, and we are thankful! </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Honestly, we tried another platform because it was first suggested, but was unsuccessful with their fixed funding only format. <em><strong>Please forgive the inconsistencies in the video related to the funding requests for the first program and perks discussed. </strong></em>We really have put the original target goal of 10k out of pocket after hiring a competent author to get the story written for a reasonable 6,500 dollars, plus other related expenses like producing a video to tell a portion of the story, among other things.  I just couldn't see all the effort get hit with a TKO. Getting to know Brian Warren has reinforced my already tenacious work ethic, and like him, I can't go down without a fight. We turned to Indiegogo's more friendly format and are about to springboard from a potential loss and turn it into a win-win without missing a beat of enthusiasm created by all the supporters of the other program. In MMA matches, I've seen an opponent who appears to be on his way out come back with a knockout. Why not here?</p>
<p>Our goal is to get Brian's inspirational biography on the open market and have it go out to the world and do what it was supposed to do...change lives. All on the combined effort of Brian, author David M. Anthony, and me (Dan Arrow - coordinater of the project). Some have already said, ""Just do an ebook!"" It's not as easy as is sounds and ebooks are only 30% of the market at this time in their history no matter what figures anyone is bolstering. So, it will come out as an ebook too, but the other 70% must be in the traditional book arena. </p>
<p><strong>Backstory:</strong> I was required to form a publishing company and created an imprint for the spine of the book in order to facilitate project needs. Yes, I could have simply handed the project to a traditional publisher, but took on the challenges of creating a team of awesome people working together to accomplish the goal of getting a true life story out to the public. Brian graciously opened up his life with the intent that if even one person out there strives to be a better person because of it, then it was well worth every struggle he's gone through.</p>
<p>In order to complete the goal, we are requesting funds to assist with the second run of books to be printed for book signings, speaking engagements, and direct sales. The first run will be limited and again out of pocket in order to come as close as we could to the original Valentine's Day release date, but will probably not have the ability to release a single tangible copy until near completion of this promo. About 30 days off our original schedule. Not too bad for first timers!</p>
<p>Some of the delay was in part over the collection of photos to enhance the story. The author warned this would occur. It took weeks of appealing to a number of photographers only to have one MMA photographer, Monstro, respond to our request. Everyone else must have been too busy. But what a blessing - he is the best.</p>
<p>Anyway, we're still going to get over the hump with your help...no matter what it takes. I also learned from Brian that sheer determination, or ""Heart"" as he calls it, can often be a winning factor. </p>
<p>Apologies to all the fans having to pledge a second time, but I commend you for not giving up on us too easily. Thank you and bless you for your tenacity - ""Heart."" You'll have the book in hand very soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to Indiegogo for providing yet another opportunity in our persuit to make this project a complete reality.</p>

<p><em>“Ask most young guys what they want to be and they’ll say, ‘a doctor,’ or ‘a fireman,’ or ‘a police officer,’ but I could never answer that question...not until I saw my first cage fight on television.

Over forty fights later, the first thing to enter the cage is still my heart.” ~ Brian</em> <em>Warren</em></p>
<p> </p></div>","Honestly, we tried another platform because it was first suggested, but was unsuccessful with their fixed funding only format. Please forgive the inconsistencies in the video related to the funding requests for the first program and perks discussed. We really have put the original target goal of 10k out of pocket after hiring a competent author to get the story written for a reasonable 6,500 dollars, plus other related expenses like producing a video to tell a portion of the story, among other things.  I just couldn't see all the effort get hit with a TKO. Getting to know Brian Warren has reinforced my already tenacious work ethic, and like him, I can't go down without a fight. We turned to Indiegogo's more friendly format and are about to springboard from a potential loss and turn it into a win-win without missing a beat of enthusiasm created by all the supporters of the other program. In MMA matches, I've seen an opponent who appears to be on his way out come back with a knockout. Why not here?
Our goal is to get Brian's inspirational biography on the open market and have it go out to the world and do what it was supposed to do...change lives. All on the combined effort of Brian, author David M. Anthony, and me (Dan Arrow - coordinater of the project). Some have already said, ""Just do an ebook!"" It's not as easy as is sounds and ebooks are only 30% of the market at this time in their history no matter what figures anyone is bolstering. So, it will come out as an ebook too, but the other 70% must be in the traditional book arena. 
Backstory: I was required to form a publishing company and created an imprint for the spine of the book in order to facilitate project needs. Yes, I could have simply handed the project to a traditional publisher, but took on the challenges of creating a team of awesome people working together to accomplish the goal of getting a true life story out to the public. Brian graciously opened up his life with the intent that if even one person out there strives to be a better person because of it, then it was well worth every struggle he's gone through.
In order to complete the goal, we are requesting funds to assist with the second run of books to be printed for book signings, speaking engagements, and direct sales. The first run will be limited and again out of pocket in order to come as close as we could to the original Valentine's Day release date, but will probably not have the ability to release a single tangible copy until near completion of this promo. About 30 days off our original schedule. Not too bad for first timers!
Some of the delay was in part over the collection of photos to enhance the story. The author warned this would occur. It took weeks of appealing to a number of photographers only to have one MMA photographer, Monstro, respond to our request. Everyone else must have been too busy. But what a blessing - he is the best.
Anyway, we're still going to get over the hump with your help...no matter what it takes. I also learned from Brian that sheer determination, or ""Heart"" as he calls it, can often be a winning factor. 
Apologies to all the fans having to pledge a second time, but I commend you for not giving up on us too easily. Thank you and bless you for your tenacity - ""Heart."" You'll have the book in hand very soon.
Thanks to Indiegogo for providing yet another opportunity in our persuit to make this project a complete reality.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/>The extensive study made by me about Baba, goes to
confirm that <b>Baba is a Perfect and
Divine Satguru (Master) or Qutub (Sufi Master) representing all Gods who are
subsumed in Baba.</b> And it is for this reason that Baba had appeared in the
forms of various Gods to different devotees when they visited Shirdi for Baba’s
darshan including as Jesus Christ to Christians. For Baba, all religions were
equal and Baba asked the people belonging to various religions to continue to
have faith in the <b>God of their choice</b>.
Baba was against religious syncretism and insularism. By his appearance Baba
brought about total harmony between the Hindus and the Muslims and others
belonging to other religions. The birth and parentage of Baba are shrouded in
mystery and no person, however closely associated with Baba, expressed clearly
and correctly in this regard. Nothing is known about his parents. Saint Namdev
and Saint Kabir were not born like ordinary mortals. Namdev was found on the
banks of Bhimrathi river and Kabir on the banks of Bhagirathi river. <b>Similar was the case with Sai Baba who
first manifested himself as a young lad of sixteen years under a neem tree in
Shirdi.</b> <b>He did not have a name
earlier.</b> The perusal of the main article in the Blog will provide more
details. </p>
<p><b>The Blog and readership:</b> These articles have been placed some two

all the more striking to know that the people in <b>St.Martin</b>,
perhaps the smallest island in the world in the South-Eastern Caribbean Sea,
having a population of about 38,000, have also felt the presence of Baba and
are perusing the articles. Another similar island is <b>Curaçao</b> in Caribbean Sea

<p>My father-in-law, late Sri B.Umamaheswara
Rao (B.U.Rao), a retired high ranking police officer, was a staunch devotee of
Sai Baba and after his retirement, took up incessantly to the task of
propagating the principles and philosophy of Sai Baba by starting a monthly
magazine and later took up writing several books on Sai Baba. His wife, late
Mrs.B.Mani Umamaheswara Rao was also equally devoted to Sai Baba and wrote some
books on Sai Baba. B.U.Rao was suffering from heart valve trouble since a long
time. <b>He was lucky to get the Grace of
Sai Baba who did a heart operation on Rao in a dream. </b>The attending
cardiologist at that time, took him for x-ray and scanning etc., and based on the
medical records it was confirmed that Rao underwent a successful heart
operation and thereafter Rao stopped using medicines. This is well known in the
circles of Sai devotees in South India. I was a constant observer of several
instances about Rao concerning Baba’s miracles including his life extension. <b>There is one article in the Blog on Rao
with his chest photo after operation which can be perused.</b> Along with my
in-laws, I have been visiting Shirdi with my family and met some of the
devotees of Baba who saw Baba when he was in mortal coil. Several miracles have
taken place in my family also. <b>Details of miracles have been narrated in
the article on compiler with his photo, placed in the Blog. </b></p>
<p>During Dec 1886 Baba told
Mhalsapati that his life would leave his body and that he would rest in peace
for three full days and that thereafter his life would come back to his
physical body and advised him to protect his body during the three-day period
without being moved and accordingly Baba got back his life after three days. <b>This has comparison with the resurrection
of Jesus Christ.</b> For details, one can visit the article, “Mhalsapati” in
the Blog.</p>
<p>Baba would get up very early in
the morning and meditate for some time while sitting near the dhuni (holy
fire). No one would be there and allowed inside the mosque or masjid at that
time.  After some time he would chant
words like, ""Yaade Haq,"" ""Allah Vali Hai,"" and ""Allah
Maalik Hai"" and perform some yogic mudras by hands in between, signifying
some communications with or directions to some unknown and perhaps to some
invisible divine bodies. </p>
<p>Baba also said that one should
have a Guru to live a happy life and achieve progress in life, temporal and
spiritual. Baba was a <b>Hindu fakir</b>
but bore the caste marks of a Hindu and was not circumcised and lived in a <b>Hindu masjid</b> called Dwarakamai (both
expressions in <b>oxymoron</b>, a figure of
speech). Baba was calling the masjid as Dwarakamai and there must be some
significance about this name.  <b>The significance is brought out by research
done by the compiler based on publications brought out by B.V.Dev, K.Narayana
Aiyar, Nagesh Vasudev Gunaji and Hemadri/Hemadpant</b> and one can peruse the
details in the article placed in the Blog under the name, “Baba’s Daily
Routine”.  </p>
<p>Many devotees consider Baba as
Lord Krishna. Baba used to appear as Lord Krishna to Bapusaheb Booty and Baba’s
Marble Statue was installed in the Samadhimandir (place of interment) where the
statue of Lord Krishna was originally proposed to be installed. Baba knew
Sanskrit and many other languages and interpreted Bhagwat Gita stanzas with
deep and subtle scholarly annotation. Samadhimandir thus proved to be perfectly
the abode of Lord Krishna, who is none other than Baba himself in his present manifestation.
Another instance about Jamnere miracle: Sai Baba himself came as a peon,
tongawala and horses and managed and brought Ramgir Bua to Nanasaheb
Chandorkar’s house in Jamnere and delivered Baba’s udhi and arati song at the
time of difficult delivery of Chandorkar’s daughter. All <b>these</b> things had happened precisely and accurately to help the
devotees at the exact right time. For details, one can visit the article in the
Blog under the name, “Nanasaheb Chandorkar”. At one stage, Baba said, “I am
your servant’s servant”, next said, “I am a servant of Allah” and again said,
“I am He”. <b>Human intellect fails to
understand these statements but all these statements are facts as he displayed
himself in all these multiple roles.</b> In the case of Santaram Balwant Nachne
(S.B.Nachne),  Baba helped his elder
brother even though none of them knew about Baba. <b>This is a case to show that Baba would help people even when they did
not know Baba.</b> Baba is also an Ocean of Compassion and there are a plethora
of instances in support of Baba’s Compassion. One such instance is about S.B.
Nachne who once started by train to go to Nasik and Baba appeared as Ganpat
Shankar working as a peon in the Bombay Arts School, Andheri who accompanied
Nachne to Nasik and took care of him in the entire journey by train. After
returning to Andheri, Nachne wanted to meet him and went to the school and made
enquiries and found to his surprise that there was no such person working in
the school. This instance took place in 1929 after Baba’s mahasamadhi,
indicating that Baba is active even after his mahasamadhi. For more details,
one can visit the article in the Blog, “Santaram Balwant Nachne”. <b>All these events bear eloquent testimony in
support of the vigilant and continuous care of Baba for the welfare of the
devotees.</b></p>
<p>Baba was Lord Shiva to Megha, the
first priest to Baba who introduced the congregational worship to Baba. Once
during a puja ritual, Megha took up the whole pot of holy water and turned it
upside down over the head of Baba by way of abhisekam (pouring water on idol of
God). Strangely, not a drop of water fell on the body of Baba. The whole water
had fallen on the head only without touching Baba’s body. So, just as Siva
(another Hindu God) had tied up Ganga river in his own tuft, Baba also used his
head for retaining and throwing away the water so as not to touch his body or
clothes. For details, one can visit the article in the Blog under name,
“Megha”.</p>
<p>Upasani Baba who observed Baba
from close quarters said: ""Sai Baba is the unborn, the veritable Brahman
(Supreme Lord)."" Narke, the highest qualified devotee of Baba, was of the
strong opinion that Baba was operating not only in this world but also in
other worlds and that he was operating in an invisible form. Baba had full
control over the Pancha-Maha-Bhute (five elements constituting the entire
universe) and knew the future course of events and could mould them, concerning
the devotees. </p>
<p>Baba also said that anyone could
concentrate and meditate on Baba’s form or could also meditate on his Nirankara
Swarup (Formless God). As per Baba's declaration, there is no difference
between Baba and his photo. People who were unable to visit any Baba temple,
can have a photo of Baba, if necessary by download from the internet and pray
before Baba's photo as Baba's photo is tantamount to Baba being present in that
photo. Any prayer to Baba's photo is the same as prayer offered to Baba himself.
This is a fact which was proved in the case of Appasaheb Kulkarni. One can
visit the article in the Blog under title, “Appasaheb Kulkarni”.</p>
<p>Many
people came to test the divinity of Baba and once Thakkar came to Shirdi and
tested Baba in several ways and got convinced that Baba was a real divine saint
and <b>that miracles were a matter of
routine for him. </b>For
more details, one can visit the article, “Some atheists tested Baba for his
saintly and supernatural powers” in the Blog.</p>
<p><b>When Baba’s articles are available in the
internet, why do I want to publish them in a book shape? This is a good
question and the answer is to enable the readers/other people to have these
articles in the shape of a concomitant book, a memorabile, a thing worthy of
rememberance. </b>The book will not be priced and <b>there will not be any price tag on the book to ensure free distribution.</b>  The funds raised will be utilized for
publishing the book while the articles placed in the public domain will
continue to be as they are for continued viewing by the general public as
usual. </p>
<p>The mosque was in a dilapidated
condition which was not fit for inhabitation but Baba lived there and all the
while Baba lived on begging food for himself and for others also. He used a
brick as his pillow and was wearing tattered clothes. He took dakshina, small money-gifts
from some of the devotees but gave away money to others more than what he
received as money gifts, which was again shrouded in mystery. <b>At the time he passed away by Mahasamadhi,
he was having only Rs.16 enough for his funeral rites.</b> Immediately after
Mahasamadhi, Baba as usual was active, appearing in the dreams of the devotees
and on the very next day, Baba appeared in a dream to Laxmanmama Joshi and
asked him to come to the masjid and perform as usual the puja ritual to him.
Baba also said that Jog, the usual priest would not come as he thought that
Baba was dead. Joshi came and did puja to Baba (Baba’s Body) and performed puja
<b>as if Baba was alive.</b> Later Jog  performed the noon arati and thus the arati
rituals continued undisturbed. This indicates that Baba went only into
Mahasamadhi and perhaps took death as a formality and transited to earlier
Unmanifest(Infinite or Nirguna) State. </p>
<p>Baba had also declared in the
masjid, “My bones will talk to you from my grave and keep immense faith in me.
The eternal truth is I am always alive and this is my promise to you all, which
you should never forget.""  One can
visit the article in the Blog under name, “Moreshwar. W. Pradhan” for details. <b>In support of this declaration, there
were/are many instances of miracles that took place after Baba’s Mahasamadhi.</b></p>
<p>Dixit had approached in 1922 the
Ahmednagar District Court for permission to set up a Public Trust to administer
the Baba’s shrine and got permission from the Court. At this stage, Abdul Baba,
induced by some of his well wishers, approached the Court, claiming that he was
the legal heir to Baba and that he had every right to manage the shrine. Baba
during his life time, never mentioned any one as his successor. The Court held
that there was no heir or successor to Baba, affirming the concept that <b>there cannot be any successor to God</b>.</p>

My father-in-law, late Sri B.Umamaheswara
Rao (B.U.Rao), a retired high ranking police officer, was a staunch devotee of
Sai Baba and after his retirement, took up incessantly to the task of
propagating the principles and philosophy of Sai Baba by starting a monthly
magazine and later took up writing several books on Sai Baba. His wife, late
Mrs.B.Mani Umamaheswara Rao was also equally devoted to Sai Baba and wrote some
books on Sai Baba. B.U.Rao was suffering from heart valve trouble since a long
time. He was lucky to get the Grace of
Sai Baba who did a heart operation on Rao in a dream. The attending
cardiologist at that time, took him for x-ray and scanning etc., and based on the
medical records it was confirmed that Rao underwent a successful heart
operation and thereafter Rao stopped using medicines. This is well known in the
circles of Sai devotees in South India. I was a constant observer of several
instances about Rao concerning Baba’s miracles including his life extension. There is one article in the Blog on Rao
with his chest photo after operation which can be perused. Along with my
in-laws, I have been visiting Shirdi with my family and met some of the
devotees of Baba who saw Baba when he was in mortal coil. Several miracles have
taken place in my family also. Details of miracles have been narrated in
the article on compiler with his photo, placed in the Blog. 
During Dec 1886 Baba told
Mhalsapati that his life would leave his body and that he would rest in peace
for three full days and that thereafter his life would come back to his
physical body and advised him to protect his body during the three-day period
without being moved and accordingly Baba got back his life after three days. This has comparison with the resurrection
of Jesus Christ. For details, one can visit the article, “Mhalsapati” in
the Blog.
Baba would get up very early in
the morning and meditate for some time while sitting near the dhuni (holy
fire). No one would be there and allowed inside the mosque or masjid at that
time.  After some time he would chant
words like, ""Yaade Haq,"" ""Allah Vali Hai,"" and ""Allah
Maalik Hai"" and perform some yogic mudras by hands in between, signifying
some communications with or directions to some unknown and perhaps to some
invisible divine bodies. 
Baba also said that one should
have a Guru to live a happy life and achieve progress in life, temporal and
spiritual. Baba was a Hindu fakir
but bore the caste marks of a Hindu and was not circumcised and lived in a Hindu masjid called Dwarakamai (both
expressions in oxymoron, a figure of
speech). Baba was calling the masjid as Dwarakamai and there must be some
significance about this name.  The significance is brought out by research
done by the compiler based on publications brought out by B.V.Dev, K.Narayana
Aiyar, Nagesh Vasudev Gunaji and Hemadri/Hemadpant and one can peruse the
details in the article placed in the Blog under the name, “Baba’s Daily
Routine”.  
Many devotees consider Baba as
Lord Krishna. Baba used to appear as Lord Krishna to Bapusaheb Booty and Baba’s
Marble Statue was installed in the Samadhimandir (place of interment) where the
statue of Lord Krishna was originally proposed to be installed. Baba knew
Sanskrit and many other languages and interpreted Bhagwat Gita stanzas with
deep and subtle scholarly annotation. Samadhimandir thus proved to be perfectly
the abode of Lord Krishna, who is none other than Baba himself in his present manifestation.
Another instance about Jamnere miracle: Sai Baba himself came as a peon,
tongawala and horses and managed and brought Ramgir Bua to Nanasaheb
Chandorkar’s house in Jamnere and delivered Baba’s udhi and arati song at the
time of difficult delivery of Chandorkar’s daughter. All these things had happened precisely and accurately to help the
devotees at the exact right time. For details, one can visit the article in the
Blog under the name, “Nanasaheb Chandorkar”. At one stage, Baba said, “I am
your servant’s servant”, next said, “I am a servant of Allah” and again said,
“I am He”. Human intellect fails to
understand these statements but all these statements are facts as he displayed
himself in all these multiple roles. In the case of Santaram Balwant Nachne
(S.B.Nachne),  Baba helped his elder
brother even though none of them knew about Baba. This is a case to show that Baba would help people even when they did
not know Baba. Baba is also an Ocean of Compassion and there are a plethora
of instances in support of Baba’s Compassion. One such instance is about S.B.
Nachne who once started by train to go to Nasik and Baba appeared as Ganpat
Shankar working as a peon in the Bombay Arts School, Andheri who accompanied
Nachne to Nasik and took care of him in the entire journey by train. After
returning to Andheri, Nachne wanted to meet him and went to the school and made
enquiries and found to his surprise that there was no such person working in
the school. This instance took place in 1929 after Baba’s mahasamadhi,
indicating that Baba is active even after his mahasamadhi. For more details,
one can visit the article in the Blog, “Santaram Balwant Nachne”. All these events bear eloquent testimony in
support of the vigilant and continuous care of Baba for the welfare of the
devotees.
Baba was Lord Shiva to Megha, the
first priest to Baba who introduced the congregational worship to Baba. Once
during a puja ritual, Megha took up the whole pot of holy water and turned it
upside down over the head of Baba by way of abhisekam (pouring water on idol of
God). Strangely, not a drop of water fell on the body of Baba. The whole water
had fallen on the head only without touching Baba’s body. So, just as Siva
(another Hindu God) had tied up Ganga river in his own tuft, Baba also used his
head for retaining and throwing away the water so as not to touch his body or
clothes. For details, one can visit the article in the Blog under name,
“Megha”.
Upasani Baba who observed Baba
from close quarters said: ""Sai Baba is the unborn, the veritable Brahman
(Supreme Lord)."" Narke, the highest qualified devotee of Baba, was of the
strong opinion that Baba was operating not only in this world but also in
other worlds and that he was operating in an invisible form. Baba had full
control over the Pancha-Maha-Bhute (five elements constituting the entire
universe) and knew the future course of events and could mould them, concerning
the devotees. 
Baba also said that anyone could
concentrate and meditate on Baba’s form or could also meditate on his Nirankara
Swarup (Formless God). As per Baba's declaration, there is no difference
between Baba and his photo. People who were unable to visit any Baba temple,
can have a photo of Baba, if necessary by download from the internet and pray
before Baba's photo as Baba's photo is tantamount to Baba being present in that
photo. Any prayer to Baba's photo is the same as prayer offered to Baba himself.
This is a fact which was proved in the case of Appasaheb Kulkarni. One can
visit the article in the Blog under title, “Appasaheb Kulkarni”.
Many
people came to test the divinity of Baba and once Thakkar came to Shirdi and
tested Baba in several ways and got convinced that Baba was a real divine saint
and that miracles were a matter of
routine for him. For
more details, one can visit the article, “Some atheists tested Baba for his
saintly and supernatural powers” in the Blog.
When Baba’s articles are available in the
internet, why do I want to publish them in a book shape? This is a good
question and the answer is to enable the readers/other people to have these
articles in the shape of a concomitant book, a memorabile, a thing worthy of
rememberance. The book will not be priced and there will not be any price tag on the book to ensure free distribution.  The funds raised will be utilized for
publishing the book while the articles placed in the public domain will
continue to be as they are for continued viewing by the general public as
usual. 
The mosque was in a dilapidated
condition which was not fit for inhabitation but Baba lived there and all the
while Baba lived on begging food for himself and for others also. He used a
brick as his pillow and was wearing tattered clothes. He took dakshina, small money-gifts
from some of the devotees but gave away money to others more than what he
received as money gifts, which was again shrouded in mystery. At the time he passed away by Mahasamadhi,
he was having only Rs.16 enough for his funeral rites. Immediately after
Mahasamadhi, Baba as usual was active, appearing in the dreams of the devotees
and on the very next day, Baba appeared in a dream to Laxmanmama Joshi and
asked him to come to the masjid and perform as usual the puja ritual to him.
Baba also said that Jog, the usual priest would not come as he thought that
Baba was dead. Joshi came and did puja to Baba (Baba’s Body) and performed puja
as if Baba was alive. Later Jog  performed the noon arati and thus the arati
rituals continued undisturbed. This indicates that Baba went only into
Mahasamadhi and perhaps took death as a formality and transited to earlier
Unmanifest(Infinite or Nirguna) State. 
Baba had also declared in the
masjid, “My bones will talk to you from my grave and keep immense faith in me.
The eternal truth is I am always alive and this is my promise to you all, which
you should never forget.""  One can
visit the article in the Blog under name, “Moreshwar. W. Pradhan” for details. In support of this declaration, there
were/are many instances of miracles that took place after Baba’s Mahasamadhi.
Dixit had approached in 1922 the
Ahmednagar District Court for permission to set up a Public Trust to administer
the Baba’s shrine and got permission from the Court. At this stage, Abdul Baba,
induced by some of his well wishers, approached the Court, claiming that he was
the legal heir to Baba and that he had every right to manage the shrine. Baba
during his life time, never mentioned any one as his successor. The Court held
that there was no heir or successor to Baba, affirming the concept that there cannot be any successor to God.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Growing up I was academically challenged but the best of the best artistically.  In the beginning of the book I  talk about a prominent figure in the dance world who took me under his wing and mentored me throughout my career. Then in 1953 I was chosen as one of 6 students from 60 to move even further away from home to study with two more famous dance icons in Yugoslavia. I was the first American to attend the International Ballet School in Split, and the first boy to attend the school as well. I was considered one of the most outstanding dancers on the continent in 1955 then became the Premier danseur of the Yugoslav National Ballet in Split in 1956. Life couldn’t get much better than this. I talk about falling in and out of love many times,  and find myself making the best of a bad situation in late 1957 that brought me back home to America much too soon. I talk extensively and in detail about how I built an empire from scratch with the help and guidance from my mom and dad. Then, at my breaking point, alcohol and bad judgement took over my life and I found myself walking away from everything after seventeen years. These are just a few of the many stories I talk about in my book. My chronicle is not just a book for dance admirers, it's for everyone in any career field. It’s about life and how you play the cards your dealt, no matter how good or bad. And how quickly life can change your direction, in a heartbeat. I don’t just speak about the many high points in my life and career, I also share with the reader all the suffering and heartache that went along with it, </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">on stage and off.</i></p>

But on the downside you are also the financiers as well.

Moram dati svoju suprugu kredit za visi tamo sa mnom u cijelom ovom procesu, skladanje moju priču dok sam oživjeli ovaj burno putovanje kroz nju.

(Vidi hrvatski prijevod u nastavku)



 
My name is Myles Marsden. I am an Internationally known dancer, teacher, choreographer  and Premier danseur formally with the Yugoslav National Ballet in Split in the 1950's. I am the founder of the very first civic ballet company in my home State of Rhode Island, called the State Ballet of RI. I was also their first Artistic Director and chief choreographer from 1959-1976. This was just a small part  of my career, so much more happened in-between and after that  makes up my story.

Today at age 78 I am retired from the stage and aside from being an author I am also an artist of whimsical characters, which I call Dancing Doodles. I refer to my drawings as the Art with a Heart  because I donate a portion of each sale from my   art to the American Heart Association, a charity that is very near and dear to me.


My wife Linda, who co-authored the book with me, finally finished writing my biography, which is the chronicles of my life and 63 years of my career. Wow! I never thought we’d get it done. It only took five and a half years of reminiscing with old friends from my past, researching, writing, erasing, rewriting and driving my wife absolutely crazy with details. It was all worth it though, and it turned out better than I imagined. This was not an easy book to write especially for Linda. It's my story in intimate detail, and it is important to me that I get to tell it, as you will understand  more after you read it. I have to give my wife credit for hanging in there with me throughout this process, composing my story while I relived this tumultuous journey through her. She listened for hours while I spoke about different events of my life. Some things she already knew and some things she was hearing for the first time. Some things uncomfortable, to say the least, but she never judged and I love her even more for that, she did a tremendous job.""Thank you baby"" 
My My book is included in PERKS $25-$50-$75-$100-$250-$500-$1000 and is signed by the authors. Available January 2015 and mailed out directly to you.

This is a story about following a dream that my mom and I had since 1952, overcoming struggles, reveling in successes, and just plain surviving many obstacles along the way. Writing this book has been an obsession to me over the past five years, it is filling a promise that I  made to my mother before she passed away.   I wrote about..... 



 Why my parents choose to send their 16 year old son 3459 miles away to  London in 1952, to attend an English boarding school.
What was was like being a young American teenager moving to communist Yugoslavia to live in 1953 and what brought me there and why I stayed
How it felt to lead the National Ballet of Split in Yugoslavia, as their Premier danseur in 1956, representing their country on their good will tour to Turkey and Istanbul, and being an American citizen in a socialist country during such difficult times.
Why I abruptly gave all this up after six years of hard work and moved back to America in 1958 when I was on top of the world with my career.
How I got so many influential people to volunteer their time working beside me and my mother, supporting our dream from 1952, how my mom and I fit my first wife into all of this, and what role she really did play.
How I survived after walking away from a successful Empire in 1976 that I built from scratch, why I took nothing with me and closed the door behind me.
How I dealt with the constant plagiarism of my 63 plus years legacy and the back stabbing from some of the people that were closest to me.
How I survived my third major heart attack, devastating financial loss, then cancer, all within a ten year span and still found the strength to go on at age 65.
How I coped going from financial success, being able to pick up the dinner check for a group of friends on any given day, to the  lowest point in my life where I waited in a line for my name to be called at the food bank to put dinner on the table.
How I finally found contentment in my life today after so many years of struggle and hard times

Growing up I was academically challenged but the best of the best artistically.  In the beginning of the book I  talk about a prominent figure in the dance world who took me under his wing and mentored me throughout my career. Then in 1953 I was chosen as one of 6 students from 60 to move even further away from home to study with two more famous dance icons in Yugoslavia. I was the first American to attend the International Ballet School in Split, and the first boy to attend the school as well. I was considered one of the most outstanding dancers on the continent in 1955 then became the Premier danseur of the Yugoslav National Ballet in Split in 1956. Life couldn’t get much better than this. I talk about falling in and out of love many times,  and find myself making the best of a bad situation in late 1957 that brought me back home to America much too soon. I talk extensively and in detail about how I built an empire from scratch with the help and guidance from my mom and dad. Then, at my breaking point, alcohol and bad judgement took over my life and I found myself walking away from everything after seventeen years. These are just a few of the many stories I talk about in my book. My chronicle is not just a book for dance admirers, it's for everyone in any career field. It’s about life and how you play the cards your dealt, no matter how good or bad. And how quickly life can change your direction, in a heartbeat. I don’t just speak about the many high points in my life and career, I also share with the reader all the suffering and heartache that went along with it, on stage and off.

Where crowd funding comes into all this...

I am working with a wonderful publishing company (Parker House Books.com) who is helping me produce a professionally finished product that will be printed in English and Croatian, in soft copy an a ebook and audio as well. Then there is the marketing end of the book.

Dopustite mi da se predstavim ...

 

Moje ime je Myles Marsden . Ja sammeđunarodno poznati plesač , učitelj , koreograf, premijer danseur formalno Jugoslavenske narodne Baleta u Splitu u 1950 . Ja sam utemeljitelj prvog građanskog Baletna trupa u mom rodnom državi Rhode Island , pod nazivomDržavna Balet RI . Također sam bio njihov prvi umjetnički ravnatelj i glavni koreograf 1959-1976 . Ovo je samomali dio moje karijere , toliko više se dogodilo između te nakon toga čini moju priču .




Danas je u dobi od 78 sam povukao s pozornice, a osim što jean autor sam ian umjetnik hirovitih likova koje sam poziv Dancing Doodles. Mislim na moje crteže kao umjetnosti sa srcem, jer sam donirati dio svake prodaje iz moje umjetnosti na American Heart Association, ljubavi koja je vrlo blizu i dragi u mene.




Moja supruga Linda, koji je koautor knjige sa mnom, konačno završio pisanje moju biografiju, što je kronike mog života i 63 godina moje karijere. Wow! Nikad nisam mislio da ćemo dobiti to učinio. Trebala je samo pet i pol godina prisjećajući se sa starim prijateljima iz moje prošlosti, istraživanje, pisanje, brisanje, prepisivanjem i vožnje moja supruga apsolutno ludo s detaljima. To je sve to vrijedi iako, i ispalo je bolje nego što sam zamišljao. To nije biloan lako knjiga napisati posebno za Lindom. To je moja priča u intimne detalje, a to je važno za mene da sam se to reći, jer ćete shvatiti više nakon što ga pročitate. Moram dati svoju suprugu kredit za visi tamo sa mnom u cijelom ovom procesu, skladanje moju priču dok sam oživjeli ovaj burno putovanje kroz nju. Slušala satima dok sam govorio o različitim događajima u mom životu. Neke stvari je već znao i neke stvari koje je čula po prvi put. Neke stvari neugodno, u najmanju ruku, ali ona nikad nije sudio a volim ju još više za to, ona je ogroman posao. ""Hvala vam bebu""
Ovo jea priča o tome slijedi san da je moja mama i ja imao od 1952. godine, prevladavanje borbe, uživajući u uspjesima, a samo običan preživjeli mnoge prepreke na putu. Pišući ovu knjigu bilaan opsesija mi se u proteklih pet godina, to je punjenje obećanje koje sam napravio na moju majku prije nego što je preminuo.
Postoji toliko mnogo neodgovorenih pitanja koja treba riješiti, počevši sa samo tih nekoliko navedene u nastavku.


  Zašto moji roditelji odlučite poslati svoje 16-godišnji sin 3.459 milja daleko u London 1952. godine, da prisustvuju engleskom škola?
Ono što ga je kao daa mladi američki tinejdžer seli u komunističkoj Jugoslaviji živjeti 1953. godine, a ono što me doveo tamo i zašto sam ostao?
Kakav je bio osjećaj voditi nacionalni balet Splita kao njihov Premier danseur 1956. godine, što predstavlja svoju zemlju na njihovu dobrobit će obići u Tursku i Istanbul, kaoan američki državljanin u socijalističkoj zemlji u tako teškim vremenima?
Zašto sam se naglo dati sve ovo gore nakon šest godina napornog rada i preseliti natrag u Ameriku 1958. godine, kada sam bio na vrhu svijeta s moje karijere?
Kako sam se toliko utjecajni ljudi volontiraju svoje vrijeme na posao pored mene i podršku moje majke i moj san 1959. godine, gdje je moja prva supruga uklapaju u sve ovo, koju ulogu je ona igrati i kako?
Kako sam preživjela nakon hodanja od uspješne carstva u 1976 koji sam sagradio od nule, a zašto sam uzeti ništa sa mnom i zatvorite vrata za sobom?
Kako se bavila sam se sa stalnim plagiranje mog 50 plus godina nasljeđe i leđa ubadanje od nekih ljudi koji su bili najbliži mi?
Kako sam preživjela svoj treći veliki srčani udar, razorne financijske gubitke, zatim rak, sve u razmaku od deset godina i još uvijek pronaći snage za odlaskom na 65 godina?
Kako sam nositi ide od financijskog uspjeha, biti u mogućnosti pokupiti večera ček za grupu prijatelja na bilo koji dan, do najniže točke u mom životu gdje sam čekao u redu za moje ime da se zove na hranu banke staviti večeru na stol?
Kako sam konačno naći zadovoljstvo u životu i danas, nakon toliko godina borbe i teškim vremenima?

To su samo neka od mnogih pitanja koje sam obratio. To je nemoguće dati jednostavan i kratak odgovor na pitanja poput ovih. Umjesto toga, govorim o njima u dubini cijeloj knjizi?


Odrastanje sam akademski je izazvao, alithe najbolji od najboljih umjetnički. Na početku knjige govorim o istaknutom figura u plesnom svijetu koji me je uzeo pod svoje okrilje, a mi mentorstvom cijeloj mojoj karijeri. Onda je 1953. sam bio izabran kao jedan od 6 studenata iz 60 pomaknuti još dalje od kuće na studij s dva više poznatih plesnih ikona u Jugoslaviji. Bio samthe prvi Amerikanac prisustvovati International Ballet School u Splitu, athe prvi dječak pohađati školu, kao dobro. Bio sam smatra jednim od najistaknutijih plesača na kontinentu 1955. a zatim je postaothe premijer danseur Jugoslavenske narodne Baleta u Splitu u 1956. životu nije mogao dobiti puno bolje od ovoga. Govorim o pada i iz ljubavi mnogo puta, i naći sebe štothe najbolje lošem stanju krajem 1957 koja me vratila kući u Ameriku puno prerano. Opsežno i detaljno o tome kako sam izgradio carstvo od nule uz pomoć i vodstvo od moje mama i tata sam razgovarati. Zatim, na moje točke pucanja, alkohol i loša prosudba preuzeo je moj život i našla sam se udaljavati od svega nakon sedamnaest godina. Ovo su samoa neke od brojnih priča koje sam razgovor u mojoj knjizi. Moja kronika nije samoa knjiga za ljubitelje plesa, to je za sve u bilo kojem polju karijere. Riječ je o životu i kako igrate kartice svoje bavila, bez obzira koliko dobro ili loše. A koliko brzo život može promijeniti svoj smjer, u srca. Ne samo govoriti o mnogim visokim mjestima u mom životu i karijeri, također sam podijeliti s čitateljima svethe patnje i bol u srcu koji je otišao zajedno s njim, na pozornici i izvan.
Gdje Publika financiranje dolazi u sve to ...
  Odlučila sam sebi objaviti svoju knjigu, što je ono što većina pisaca rade ovih dana. Samostalno objavljivanje omogućujethe pisac upravljati odredište njegove priče, kojuthe autor ima kontrolu. No, na minus što su i financijeri kao dobro. Radim s prekrasnim izdavačkoj kući (Parker House Books.com), koji pomaže mi proizvodimo profesionalno gotov proizvod koji će biti tiskani na engleskom i hrvatskom jeziku, u mekom primjerkuana knjiga kao dobro.

Također,a dio sredstava bit će doniran u dobrotvorne svrhe, moj omiljeni The American Heart Association.
Sve što mogu učiniti da mi pomogne namiriti svoje troškove bi bilo sjajno.

<h3> Why write <em>Scratch, Crackle and Pop</em>! </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As I spend more time presenting my films at workshops, master classes and retrospectives, I field an ever-increasing amount of questions from my peers concerning the technique of painting and scratching on film. I would like to create a book to make these processes available to artists, students, teachers and the general public. Publishing a “manual” of handmade animation film techniques titled, <strong>Scratch, Crackle and Pop: A whole grain approach to making films without a camera</strong> will highlight 30 years of aesthetic discoveries that I have made in super–8, 16 mm and 35 mm animated/experimental film production. To enrich the reader’s understanding of my process, I will enclose a DVD compilation of short films that I have created between 1982 and 2011. </p>
<p>There exist a very limited number of books on handmade film. There are even fewer practical “guidebooks” on the subject of handmade film <em>techniques</em>. In 2010, I decided to self-publish my first filmmaking cookbook, <a href=""http://scratchatopia.tumblr.com/Recipesforreconstruction"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""recipes for reconstruction""><strong>Recipes For Reconstruction: The Cookbook for the Frugal Filmmaker</strong></a>.

<p> </p>
<p>This second instructional book is intended to convince developing artists to try simple, inexpensive handmade filmmaking before it becomes extinct. To many people who may only know the name of Norman McLaren, this book of will introduce established international names such as Len Lye from New Zealand, Harry Smith from The United States as well as Barber Neubauer and Pierre Hebert – and new techniques such as batiking and bleaching directly onto the surface of the film. This book will also help me to cross language barriers and talk at greater length about my processes to an international audience. </p>
<p><strong> Technical Layout:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scratch, Crackle and Pop</strong> will be divided into three distinctive sections. Each part will highlight the qualities and characteristics of a particular technique that I’ve used in my process (i.e. scratching, painting and brikolage) and will include a list the tools and tips for creating a successful film. Hand–drawn diagrams, film stills and photographs will also be added to support the physical production steps. Each chapter will also reference the films on the accompanying DVD. Mr. Marco DeBlois, the animation curator from the <a href=""http://www.cinematheque.qc.ca/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""cinematheque quebecoise"">Cinematheque Quebecoise</a> has graciously agreed both curate and edit the book for historical accuracy.

<p><strong><em>Wordsworth and the Dragon</em></strong> is a ""giggle-icious"" fantasy-adventure story for children in grades 3-5. I wrote it to entertain and educate, to inspire and instruct.

<h3><strong>Synopsis</strong></h3>
<p>When the letter ""C"" is stolen out of the Royal Alphabet, the Kingdom of Atoz is thrown into a panic. No one can say or write the letter, and it has vanished from all the books in the kingdom.

Wordsworth's quest leads him to a dragon named Dash and a village of savage creatures called muddletongues.

<p>Back when I first decided to publish my children's book <strong><em>Wordsworth and the Dragon</em></strong>, I set about looking for an illustrator. I put the word out, emphasizing the fact that I would not be able to pay any money up front. To my surprise, a response came from Christina Wald, a top-notch professional illustrator. Christina and I had met through our mutual connection to Sylvan Dell Publishing (publisher of my three picture books). We had done a book signing together and participated in Cincinnati's annual Books by the Banks event. Christina told me that she had not had an opportunity to illustrate a fantasy story like Wordsworth in a long time, and would really enjoy doing it.</p>
<p>So far Christina has produced a glorious cover and is working on fantastic black-and-white illustrations -- two for each of the ten chapters.</p>
<h3><strong>Where Will the Money Go?</strong></h3>
<p>At this stage of the project, I am looking for sponsors to help with two major funding needs:</p>
<p>(1) In order to publish <em><strong>Wordsworth and the Dragon</strong></em> through Create Space, I will need to purchase their Total Design Freedom Children's Book Interior service. This will ensure that the text and illustrations are laid out properly and that the printed book has an attractive, professional appearance.</p>
<p>(2) I think it's about time Christina got paid something for her amazing work, don't you?</p>
<p> <strong>Other Ways to Support the Project</strong></p>
<p>Another way you can contribute to ""the cause"" is to purchase an item from the <em>Wordsworth and the Dragon</em> Zazzle store: <a href=""http://www.zazzle.com/wordsworthdragon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.zazzle.com/wordsworthdragon</a></p>

Christina and I had met through our mutual connection to Sylvan Dell Publishing (publisher of my three picture books). We had done a book signing together and participated in Cincinnati's annual Books by the Banks event. Christina told me that she had not had an opportunity to illustrate a fantasy story like Wordsworth in a long time, and would really enjoy doing it.
So far Christina has produced a glorious cover and is working on fantastic black-and-white illustrations -- two for each of the ten chapters.
Where Will the Money Go?
At this stage of the project, I am looking for sponsors to help with two major funding needs:
(1) In order to publish Wordsworth and the Dragon through Create Space, I will need to purchase their Total Design Freedom Children's Book Interior service. This will ensure that the text and illustrations are laid out properly and that the printed book has an attractive, professional appearance.
(2) I think it's about time Christina got paid something for her amazing work, don't you?

<h3>
<em>Spunk</em>, a Summary</h3>
<p>I had to wait until both my parents were dead, both my marriages were over, and all my children were too old to be traumatized by anything I could do in order to write my first novel for adults: <em>Spunk--</em>a post-apocalyptic, dystopian, urban fantasy about an Amazonian world and the woman who dares to defy its authority.</p>
<ul>
<li>As Helen H. Moore I've sold thousands of books for children and educators, for such publishers as Scholastic, Mondo, and Central Recovery Press, but this new venture required a new pen-name: Helen O'Reilly.</li>
<li>I'm branching out into self-publishing and self-actualizing simultaneously. As the traditional publishing industry morphs, self-publishing has lost its stigma; it's no longer vanity publishing; it's indie publishing: this is where the cool kids are.</li>
<li>A lifelong goal has been to expand my writing repertoire to include long-form fiction--in other words, I've published children's fiction, poetry, self-help, educational and non-fiction books, but THE NOVEL has been my white whale--my Moby Dick (which is also a novel). Now the writing is done and the second part of the goal is all that remains: to publish a best-seller.</li>
<li>You will be helping me, with your contribution, fulfill my goal of seeing a novel for grown-ups, written by me, become a best-seller. (Actually, it's the first in a series.) You could be in on the conception of a book as influential as<em> Fifty Shades of Grey</em>, or <em>The Hunger Games</em>. It's better written than either of them, and loaded with sex, violence, humor, and adventure.</li>
<li>
<em>Spunk</em> is not just a book, it's a movement; it's sexy, sassy, irreverent, fun, sly, and wicked. It's the thing that life is made of, and it keeps life interesting, exciting, and fun. Spunk is Life.</li>

<li>to pay for registration fees and travel to 2 regional book conferences,</li>
<li>to pay for ads in conference journals and magazines.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project is the culmination of a lifetime of learning, growing, and working for me, and it's proof that it's never too late to achieve your dreams.

<li>My previous books have sold thousands of copies, and I have worked in the publishing industry for most of my career and understand what it takes to market a book.</li>
<li>Like you, I am not afraid of hard work, and with a little help I know I can achieve another of my goals-- to be able to honestly list my occupation as ""Writer,"" instead of ""Editor-Writer- etc.""</li>

This will be spent on paper and printing costs in order to print a limited edition run of 50 copies in black and white. If we raise £350 we will be able to print in full colour.More than £350 will enable us to buy much-needed equipment - to sustainably create more issues to come!Issue 4 will feature creative and critical writing, interviews and visual art, cut together with the aid of editorial and thoughtful design. We are producing this special issue in collaboration with Glasgow Open House festival, featuring writing that engages with and contextualizes the work on show within the festival. The ImpactUndercurrents is more than a magazine. We provide emerging artists with a platform to voice their ideas and communicate them to an extended audience. It is about building dynamic approaches to the idea of what art writing can be and how it can act as a testing ground for radical and unusual theories.Undercurrents is bigger than just print too.

<div class=""mhl"">
<p>Stories and Queer reading series steps in to embrace queer and queer friendly poets and writers who express themselves, the issues/ideas most important to them.

<p>We are a traveling reading series that aims to provide a space for local &amp; national readers/listeners to connect with queer &amp; queer-friendly writers in underrepresented areas of the country. The virtual components of this series are unique and allow us to reach beyond the local borders of the event. </p>

<h2>What is This Magazine?</h2>
<p>For 47 years, <em>This Magazine</em> has been publishing the voices, issues and topics mainstream corporate media ignores. From its early days as<em> This</em> <em>Magazine is About Schools</em>, the magazine has grown to be Canada's leading progressive magazine of politics, arts and culture. The magazine is home to award-winning investigative journalism, in-depth coverage of Canadian arts and culture and new work by the best emerging and established talent.</p>
<p><em>This Magazine</em> regularly publishes stories about politics, the environment, social justice, labour, aboriginal peoples, human rights, feminism and queer issues. Stories like these turn heads, but they seldom turn profits. We publish these stories because we believe they're important. But they're not the kind of topics (Kardashians Do Stuff No One Cares About! Please Your Man Tips! Justin Bieber Insults Historical Landmarks!) that commerical media and magazines churn out and build their big business on.</p>
<p>Nobody owns <em>This Magagzine</em>. We don't rely on advertising or corporate sponsorship. We run a tight ship with low overhead and an operating budget that's smaller than what most mainstream magazines spend on a single issue.</p>
<p>We may not have a big bottom line, but what we do have is freedom. Our writers can tell the stories they want, in the way they want to. Since 1966, <em>This</em> <em>Magazine</em> has brought Canadians thousands of important stories that counter the status quo, expose wrongdoing and expand the debate on issues that matter to you. This important work hasn't gone unnoticed. In 2008, <em>This</em> <em>Magazine</em> was named one of the 20 most influential Canadian magazines of all time. <em>This Magazine</em> has been named Small Magazine of the Year by the Canadian Society of Magazine Editors three years running, received more than 80 National Magazine Award nominations, been a five-time winner at the Canadian Newsstand Awards and been nominated for Utne Independent Press Awards.</p>
<p><em>This Magazine</em> gives you an uncompromising, uncensored, unapologetic magazine with real people and real politics that have a daily impact on you, your family, your world.</p>
<h2>What do we need?</h2>
<p><em>This Magazine</em> turns 47 this month (I know! It really is hard to believe!) and to celebrate this milestone we're looking for 100 people to donate $47 each. That's one dollar for every year the magazine has been publishing.*</p>
<p>But, there's more ... If we reach our fundraising goal of $4,700 in the next 30 days <em>This Magazine</em> Board member, Coach House Books publicist and author of <em>The Dead Kid Detective Agency </em>Evan Munday will eat 47 veggie dogs in two hours! That's a lot of veggie in not a lot of time!**</p>
<p>So if you've always dreamed of seeing Evan eat 47 hot dogs in one sitting here is your chance.</p>
<p>It's also your chance to support independent progressive media and help <em>This Magazine</em> publish uninterrupted for another 47 years. Every little bit helps a small magazine like <em>This </em>and as a thank you for your support we've got great commemorative hot dog eating gifts available. All donations are also tax-deductible!</p>
<p>Help us reach our goal of $4,700 and help <em>This Magazine</em> continue to provide a national forum for people, opinions and ideas not found anywhere eles. We couldn't do this important work without your support.</p>
<p>We can't thank you enough for donating.</p>
<p><em>This Magazine</em></p>
<p>P.S. Please help us spread the word about our campaign. Tell your friends! Get on Facebook and Twitter now and help us promote the heck out of our campaign. Cute cat videos can wait! We're talking about Evan Munday eating 47 hot dogs! Let's make it happen!</p>
<p>*Please note we will accept donations in amounts other than $47. This is just a suggested amount that ties in very nicely with our 47th birthday.</p>
<p>**Please note Evan Munday volunteered to do this and we don't regularly make the magazine's Board members eat huge quantities of food in a limited time period in an effort to raise much-needed cash.</p>

<h3>This is the REAL SOUTH</h3>
</div>
<div>We passionately love life in the Southern U.S. in all its quirky, creative, soulful glory. We're especially proud of the South's continuing contributions to the arts, especially music and literature. We want to turn you on to the best authentic art, music, and writing the South has to offer, especially the REAL stuff, the lesser known, under-the-radar stuff. Stuff from indie record labels, small presses, mom-and-pop cafes, industry outsiders, artisans, odd little festivals, rising stars as well as some obscure gems from the past. We also love Southern food, and want to show you the best places to find the real down-home stuff. And even how to make it yourself. Then there are the unforgettable people, the places, the culture, and so much more that makes life in the South so deeply rich and fulfilling. We want to serve you a big ol' bimonthly helping of digital soul food. <br/><br/>There are some great Southern magazines and websites out there, and they do a hell of a job covering the big names, high-end boutiques, and trendy spots in the South. There's also a dismaying trend of reality TV shows bent on exploiting tacky Southern stereotypes. The REAL SOUTH is so much larger, more sophisticated, more complex, more artistic, and yes, more culturally and racially diverse. And that's what we want to show the world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each issue of REAL SOUTH MAGAZINE comes packed with book and CD reviews; profiles of Southern artists, writers, musicians, and personalities; fiction and poetry from emerging new talents; a chosen Southern food, with recommendations where to find it and how to cook it...and so much more!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Every year we will issue special edition e-books: the best of the year's fiction, and the best of the food features, with extra recipes and tips. In 2013 we hope to issue a special guide to Southern festivals and county fairs.</div>

<div><em>Editor and Publisher Lisa J. Gouveia</em></div>
<div><em>Austin, Texas</em></div>
<div>I was Managing Editor and Art Director for a small quarterly print magazine showcasing offbeat Southern culture, and I dearly loved it. It is sadly no more, a casualty of the increasingly difficult print magazine industry. I am now Art Director for a bi-monthly regional home &amp; living magazine. But I kept getting emails, press releases, and submissions for great Southern stories and artists. A couple of small presses even sent me new books to review. Bands kept sending me their CDs. Writers and photographers throughout the South kept asking to help find a new home for their work. I soon realized I had an entire issue's worth of stuff just sitting in my inbox, not to mention a long list of story ideas that we didn't get to for the last magazine. I even have the software to lay it all out. So let's do this.</div>
<div> </div>

<div><em>Dania Beach, Florida</em></div>
<div>John Dufresne has won the <em>Yankee </em>Magazine award for fiction, the <em>Transatlantic Review</em>/Henfield Foundation Award, a PEN Syndicated Fiction award. His novel <em>Louisiana Power &amp; Light</em>was a Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers selection and a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book of the Year, 1994. He is also the author of two short story collections, <em>The Way That Water Enters Stone </em>and <em>Johnny Too Bad</em>,three chapbooks, <em>Lethe, Cupid, Time and Love;</em> <em>Well Enough Alone; </em>and <em>I Will Eat a Piece of the Roof and You Can Eat the Window</em> and the novels, <em>Love Warps the Mind a Little</em><strong><em>, </em></strong>also a <em>New York Times </em>Notable Book of the Year, 1997, <em>Deep in the Shade of Paradise</em>, and most recently, <em>Requiem, Mass</em>. He is one of the thirteen authors of the mystery novel, <em>Naked Came the Manatee</em><em>. </em>His monologue, <em>The Freezer Jesus</em> was produced as part of <em>Native Tongues</em> at Le Chat Noir Theater in New Orleans<em>. </em>He wrote the screenplay for the short film, “The Freezer Jesus” and, with Donald Papy, the feature film <em>To Live and Die in Dixie</em>, both directed by Harper Philbin.His story “Johnny Too Bad,” which originally appeared in <em>Triquarterly</em>, was included in <em>New Stories from the South: The Year’s Best, 2003.</em> His story “The Timing of Unfelt Smiles” which originally appeared in <em>Miami Noir</em>, was included in <em>Best American Mystery Stories of 2007.</em> His story “The Cross-Eyed Bear, which originally appeared in <em>Boston Noir</em>,” was selected to appear in as a <em>Best American Mystery Stories of 2010. </em>He edited the short story anthology <em>Blue Christmas</em><em>.</em> His books on writing, <em>The Lie That Tells a Truth</em> and <em>Is Life Like This?</em> are used in many university writing programs.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>Printing is just too expensive, and advertisers are spending less every day. So it makes the most sense to publish REAL SOUTH MAGAZINE in the exciting new digital realm.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The first order of business is getting the magazine set up on the Blue Toad digital newsstand (based in Orlando, Florida--we're Southern through and through!). This requires just over a thousand dollars in one-time setup fees, digital page conversion fees, and mandatory licenses for iPhone, Android, Amazon, and Nook content.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We already have about half of this money and just need the rest. Each issue after that will only cost a few hundred to produce, which is much more affordable. We mainly just need some help to get the ball rolling.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After that is covered, any remaining funds go to the contributors. Some have graciously donated their work for the premiere issue, but we hope to be able to pay them anyway. We strongly feel that ALL contributors should be PAID for their work. So many magazines and websites can't (or won't) pay for content, and that just cheapens us all. Lisa Gouveia says, ""A quarterly I once worked for was run by a millionaire who refused to pay contributors because he could always get them for free. That's just so wrong. I'm not even a thousandaire on some days, but I can scrape up at least enough for them to go have a nice dinner or something."" Hopefully more than that. Oh, and REAL SOUTH MAGAZINE will also pay upon acceptance--we never understood making contributors wait months for publication to get paid.</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Jim Maher, and I am a father of two (nearly three!) boys.  I am a stay-at-home dad, because my wife's terrible back problems prevent her from being able to lift the boys.  I would love more than anything to have a career that allows me to stay at home for my children while providing a decent life for me and my family.  The one way I know how to do it is write my stories.  </p>
<p>I write for kids because they are the most important audience.  We lose them, we lose everything.  Most publishing houses won't accept anything unless it's been professionally edited, so that's what I'm driving for.  </p>
<p>My book, <em>Mike Logan vs. The Crosstown Horde</em>, is a crossover horror/hockey adventure that will appeal to Canadians and hockey fans everywhere.  I would like to get it professionally edited before sending it out so it will have the best chance of being published.  </p>
<p>The long and the short is that I want to be the last of the great family men.  It's my dream come true.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My campaign is really more of a personal one.  If I don't raise the 1000 dollars, I'll have to get a full-time job (I know, I know, what a sob story, but my kids are my life) and my wife will get steadily worse in the back department.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I need about 1000 dollars to get <em>Mike Logan </em>professionally edited.  It will be combed over with a brilliant eye, and if you donate $20, I'll make sure you get a free signed copy some day in the future!<br/></p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p>La casa del estanque nos va desentrañando, con una prosa fluida y fresca, los misterios que rodean a una familia burguesa de mediados del siglo XX  de la mano de Eugenia, una niña curiosa y rebelde.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Avanzamos página a página de la mano de Eugenia, una niña curiosa y rebelde con la que vamos desentrañando los misterios que rodean a una familia burguesa de mediados del siglo XX, con una protagonista femenina de carácter muy dominante que nunca ha sentido afecto alguno por su nieta. Todos la temen. Sin embargo, la pequeña va creciendo con una energía poco común, dispuesta a correr riesgos con tal de ser ella misma, como si fuera una fuerza de la naturaleza.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A partir del momento en que toma conciencia de que siempre se ha sentido fuera de lugar, se resiste a permanecer al margen, como si algo en su vida no acabara de encajar. Cuenta con una amiga de clase inferior, con la que siente una fuerte complicidad. Con su abuelo, un personaje que se mueve entre luces y sombras, con el que Eugenia tiene una relación muy especial, y que será clave para desentrañar un enigma que marca el paso del tiempo.

</div></div>","¿Qué?
La casa del estanque nos va desentrañando, con una prosa fluida y fresca, los misterios que rodean a una familia burguesa de mediados del siglo XX  de la mano de Eugenia, una niña curiosa y rebelde.
Avanzamos página a página de la mano de Eugenia, una niña curiosa y rebelde con la que vamos desentrañando los misterios que rodean a una familia burguesa de mediados del siglo XX, con una protagonista femenina de carácter muy dominante que nunca ha sentido afecto alguno por su nieta. Todos la temen. Sin embargo, la pequeña va creciendo con una energía poco común, dispuesta a correr riesgos con tal de ser ella misma, como si fuera una fuerza de la naturaleza.
A partir del momento en que toma conciencia de que siempre se ha sentido fuera de lugar, se resiste a permanecer al margen, como si algo en su vida no acabara de encajar. Cuenta con una amiga de clase inferior, con la que siente una fuerte complicidad. Con su abuelo, un personaje que se mueve entre luces y sombras, con el que Eugenia tiene una relación muy especial, y que será clave para desentrañar un enigma que marca el paso del tiempo. Y con la Casa del Estanque, que parece dispuesta a susurrarle algunos secretos para que, por fin, encuentre su camino.

<h3>Print Edition: Best of B-Side</h3>
<p>The Print Edition: Best of B-Side is as the name suggests: a collection of articles that best represents all that the online publication chooses to stand for, and also a selection of never-been-published content. The publication will feature mainly English content and other languages such as Thai.</p>
<p>In this one-off physical edition, readers will discover in-depth articles, commentary, interviews, quotes, photo essays as well as other engaging content that stimulate, challenge and provide food for thought with regards to the creative process.</p>
<p>Glimpse into the spaces that women occupy in the Southeast Asian art scene. Learn more about the language surrounding the differently-abled community. Discover how cross-cultural conversations between artists can share similarities as well as distinction in the same field of practice.  </p>
<p>We hope that this publication will elevate the profiles of lesser-known practitioners, celebrate the work of creative writers and serve as an inspiration to readers. </p>
<p>Join the team in this multifaceted journey of rediscovering the region on creative and artistic terms.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About The Team </h3>

<p>Charlie Liebert, at 35, left Atheism to become a Christian.  In high school and college, he was taught he evolved from pond scum, and he wholeheartedly believed it.  In his early 20s, he earned a BS in Chemistry and an MBA in marketing. At his conversion, in 1977, he immediately saw the contradiction with the Genesis' story of Creation and the Evolution he knew.  After three years of study, he evolved from an Evolutionist into a Young Earth Creationist. He's conducted over 400 workshops and seminars for children and adults teaching Christian Apologetics in many different contexts.  In the late 90's he worked for Ken Ham's ministry ""Answers in Genesis"" for several years.  Starting in 1995, for ten years, he produced a TV show from his seminars called ""Creation Foundation Explanation” in Greensboro NC.  During his 43 years in NC Charlie became known as an excellent teacher of Christian Apologetics.  He and his wife Terry live in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, </p>
<p>Converted from hard-core atheism, he understands the atheistic worldview.  He's often heard the world ask “hard” questions that stump believers and thwart their desire to share the Gospel.  He searched the Scripture to see how Jesus got past those questions.   He asked probing questions to reveal their presuppositions. Jesus encounter with the Pharisees about John's baptism is the best example of this strategy.   In 2012 Charlie taught this questioning strategy to a group of Christian Businessmen.  It was so well received he put it into book form in  ""<i>Always Be Ready to Give an Answer!"" </i> which presents a personal Christian evangelism strategy you can use to get to the Gospel before answering those “hard” questions.  His second book, <i>ANSWERS for “The Hope That Is In You”</i>, gives direct, simple answers to the world’s “hard” questions, answering more than 100 of the questions Christians are often asked by unbelievers.  The combination of these two books helps every Christian become a fearless evangelist.  Jesus told us to declare the Gospel to the world around us.  Now Christians can do it with confidence!</p>
<p>Charlie's newest book challenges Evolution at its core, SCIENCE. It’s already been published and ready for market, however I'll need $6,000 to do proper marketing.  Because I’m retired and on a fixed income I have decided to crowdfund to raise this money. </p>
<p>This book “Without 3 Miracles Darwin’s Dead!” has the potential to change minds about the viability of Evolution because “Science Proves Atheistic Evolution is IMPOSSIBLE!”  I am exposing Evolution’s scientific impossibility because it has to violate three scientific laws to succeed; The First and Second laws of Thermodynamics and the Law of Biogenesis.   To violate a scientific law, you need a miracle and Atheistic Evolution cannot allow any, much less THREE!  I call these three necessary miracles: Magic, Frankenstein, and Uphill Molasses.  Magic is the appearance of something from nothing, a violation of the First Law.  Frankenstein is the generation of life from dead chemicals.  This violates Biogenesis which says: “life ONLY comes from life and ONLY from life of the same kind.”  The 2nd Law simply says the Universe is irreversibly running down.  Evolution is constantly gaining complexity in conflict with this law.  It’s like molasses running uphill against gravity, the third impossibility.  I’m ready to present these arguments that destroy Evolution but I need help to start the marketing.  Will you help me?  I’m offering incentives for contributions over $25.  At $25 you receive a downloadable copy of the e-book.  At $50 you get a copy of the softcover edition and at $150 a hardback copy.  A $500 contribution will get you soft cover copies of all three of my published books and at $1000 you receive hardback copies of all three books.  Please make a contribution to help defeat the lie of Evolution.  </p>
<p>This following section describes in more detail the content of the book.  In bearing testimony for Christ, through my web page, and in my role as a seminar, workshop leader and as a teacher I’m often asked: “Do you believe in Evolution?” I’ll answer: “No I don’t!” Then I get responses like: “Why not, it’s proven by science?” OR “The evidence for it is overwhelming!” OR “Only ignorant or closed-minded fundamentalists don’t believe it!”  I even get that kind of reaction from some who call themselves Christians. In this book, I am taking a hard-nosed position saying to the world; “Atheistic Evolution is scientifically impossible because it breaks three scientific LAWS” If you understand science you know scientific laws CAN’T remain laws if they are broken.  Evolution breaks THREE of them!  Besides the three laws, we’ll explore other issues that contribute to Evolution’s impossibility. There are seven chapters in this book. The first four show the impossibility of Evolution from a scientific viewpoint. The fifth is an article: The Irrationality of Unbelief by Mitch Cervinka. Chapter six looks at the Atheist’s dilemma explaining these problems.  Chapter seven examines the three most important evolutionary impacts on US culture, Atheism’s meaninglessness, the US beliefs about Creation or Evolution.  Millions of dollars are wasted on Evolutionary promotion &amp; research with no benefit.</p>
<p>Chapter 1, Science and Knowing develops an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of science and the scientific method. Science can answer some questions, but not ALL questions. Since both Creation and Evolution are descriptions of past events we must ask: “Can science help us know which model of the past is true?” One must be true and the other false because they cannot both be true.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, Evolution explains how it works and explains the issues it raises. According to its proponents, Evolution creates the Universe, without God, beginning with nothing and ending with everything that exists today. All the raw material suddenly appears and explodes with the Big Bang. During billions of years elements are formed in stars, and eventually, our Solar System assembles itself. On planet Earth, with large amounts of water, living cells arise from dead chemicals. These first cells change through mutation and Natural Selection into all the diverse forms of life on Earth today.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, describes Darwin’s THREE Impossible Miracles. I’ll explain the three scientific LAWS Evolution must break to succeed. Later I’ll deal with many other barriers to Evolution’s success. Remember Evolution starts with nothing and ends with everything that exists both today and through all time in the Universe. The three miracles are:</p>
<p>Miracle 1 – MAGIC, something from nothing. Like the magician that pulls the rabbit out of the hat, Evolution brings everything out of nothing.</p>
<p>Miracle 2 – FRANKENSTEIN, living systems arise from dead stuff. Like Dr. Frankenstein, Evolution takes dead parts and assembles them into fully functioning living organisms.</p>
<p>Miracle 3 – UPHILL MOLASSES, the downhill slide (Entropy) of the Universe is reversed again and again by the upward process of Evolution. Like molasses flowing uphill, it counters what we know about all kinds of processes: physical, chemical, atomic, etc. We observe they are ALL running down.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Falling Off the Improbable Cliff describes four areas that demonstrate both the unscientific and fraudulent nature of Evolution: 1) Missing “Missing Links”, 2) Biological Enigmas, 3) Two Evolution Frauds and 4) Biological Complexity.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Mitch Cervinka wrote The Irrationality of Unbelief, A Catalog of Contradictions. Our generation has seen an explosion of new non-Christian philosophies that claim to provide a more enlightened view of reality than other beliefs—and especially more so than the Bible. Yet, each of these philosophies self-destructs almost instantly in self-refuting contradictions and inconsistencies. No non-Biblical belief can stand up to scrutiny. The philosophies of our time are eager to criticize the Bible and especially prone to commit the very evils of which they are so critical. Mitch analyzed 15 different philosophies by three different types of inconsistencies: 1) Internal Consistency 2) Basic Human Concepts and 3) Self-Interpretation.  After seeing how these philosophies fail, he’ll offer a Biblical analysis to demonstrate the strength of Christianity.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 “What’s an Atheist to Do?” addresses Atheistic Evolutionists need for three miraculous events that break scientific laws to make Evolution work.  Atheism by its very nature prohibits supernatural intervention. There are four possible explanations Atheists can make to complete these three miracles without an appeal to the supernatural. 1) Admitting Failure. 2) Existence = Origin. 3) We Need More Information to Get an Answer and 4) Singularities.  Another approach to explaining away the miracles is Panspermia (life seeded here from outer space).  Three ways Evolution is promoted in US culture: 1) Evolution = Science. Evolutionists claim that to be a good scientist you must believe in Evolution. That’s presumptuous, illogical and false. 2) Common Origin or Common Design. Evolutionists claim that the structural similarity between different creature’s organs, systems, limbs, etc. show common descent, Creationists claim common design by an omnipotent Creator.  3) Politically Correct Evolution. Political correctness is applied to Evolution: “Evolution is true. Shut up and believe it.” </p>
<p>Chapter 7 Cultural Impacts of Evolution will deal with three of its cultural impacts. First, Atheism's descent into meaninglessness. As atheists grow in unbelief, they become more and more depraved. The Bible in Romans Chapter 1:18-32 describes this process.  Second, is the US public’s beliefs about origins as determined by polling about Creation vs. Evolution. Humanists teaching their evolutionary worldview of origins have had a monopoly on public education to teach Evolution ONLY for more than 55 years. Today, still about half the people in the US believe in Creation and that hasn’t changed in all those years. These educators can’t seem to grasp that many people won’t believe in Evolution no matter how much you try to convince them because their Evolutionary arguments are just not convincing! Third, is the millions of dollars, large amounts of time, valuable laboratory space, and intellectual talent wasted on research in Evolution.  If these resources were deployed in finding a cure for cancer, diabetes, etc. we’d be much closer to cures. Because Evolution isn’t true, these resources are COMPLETELY wasted!</p>

<h3>Unenforceable Obligations</h3>
<p>Designed to equip people for active and responsible allyship with oppressed and marginalized groups, <strong>""Unenforceable Obligations""</strong> seeks to shift the emphasis from empty ideology and easy intentions, moving instead to real (and costly) practices and lived solidarity.</p>
<p>As more people of privilege begin to understand the nature of oppression and systemic injustice, they are also realizing their need to step up and step out in active solidarity. Through well-intentioned yet misguided zeal, far too many have not only failed to appropriately support these movements but have unwittingly hindered and even harmed them. Still others will embrace performative declaration of ideological support, yet fail to work for systemic change of the very systems they espouse to resist.</p>
<p>This book seeks to shift the focus from intentions and ideology to responsible expressions of embodied allyship. The title, <strong>“Unenforceable Obligations”</strong>, is drawn from the wisdom of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who called for people who would be <i>""willingly obedient to unenforceable obligations” of change.</i> It is for the purpose of active obedience to these obligations that this book has been written.</p>
<h3>From Both Sides Of Oppression</h3>
<p>As a Christian who identifies as bisexual, I have found myself on the receiving end of discrimination, marginalization, and even threats of violence and death. From those experiences, I have come to develop deep convictions about what true allyship is (and is not), lessons sadly learned by the failure of some of my closest friends to stand alongside me in resistance.</p>
<p>However, I am also a white, cisgender man who occupies a great deal of privilege, making the need for me to embrace active allyship even more critical for me. This was made especially clear to me when I became the father of a black son. For over a decade I have dedicated myself to understanding and seeking to practice true allyship for my son and others. Bringing these two perspectives together provides a unique and vulnerable approach to this topic.</p>
<h3>Moving from Promises to Practices</h3>
<p>The book will primarily challenge the tendency towards ideological advocacy against injustice, especially ways that do not require personal and systemic changes. It will also shift away from the emphasis on <i>""being an ally""</i> (which can be static and positional) to <i>""practicing allyship""</i>.</p>
<p>Whether it is in impassioned declarations of “I’m not racist!” to the assertion that “I am LGBTQ+ affirming!”, there is all too often a failure for this to translate into action. This book will provide clear practices (and the underlying values) that put real walk to the walk of doing justice.</p>
<h3>Why This Campaign?</h3>
<p>Over the last several years, as I have worked hard at public advocacy and allyship on several fronts, I have faced some serious resistance. After 25 years of faithful service, I was ultimately pushed out of a Christian non-profit organization because of my public stance on LGBTQ+ inclusion. Further, my credibility in the Christian publishing world seemed to dry up, with my titles being banned from some of the largest distributors that carried my other titles.</p>
<p>In order to give the time and energy to this project- all while continuing to be active in my work of advocacy- I need to provide financial stability for my family. Having to rebuild our work after 25 years, right at the pandemic hit, has left us struggling. This campaign will provide the much needed resources to write the book and get it into the right hands.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with me in this way. By doing so, you are helping empower countless others to practice true allyship on behalf of those who need it most.</p>

<h3>Are you ready to shape your own future?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Michael Perman. I am an innovation futurist and head of C'EST WHAT? - the Mindful Innovation firm.  After decades of deep research around the world, I have distilled my accumulated wisdom into a <strong><u>new book, podcast series, action learning tools and innovation experiences</u> </strong>called<strong> </strong>CRAVING THE FUTURE.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561418535/h4xhnxjz12y0iucq4fyg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My mission in life is to inspire creativity in people, to help everyone create a brighter future for themselves and the organizations where they work - instead of being controlled by outside forces.  Today, I am inviting <u>you</u> to join the the movement of people who wish to <strong>take the future into their hands and own it!</strong></p>
<p><strong>You've never seen a business book quite like this one, </strong>mindfully crafted as a collaborative and interactive tool that enables people and organizations to see over the horizon...and shape their destiny.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>CRAVING THE FUTURE</strong> gives you powerful ideas, practical skills and expert advice from innovation luminaries who are paving the way forward, making the world a better place. </p>

<p><strong>Funding Goals</strong><br/>The traditional publishing model is simply not reasonable for new authors. I am taking a more future-forward approach to self-publishing and hoping you will join me.  <br/><br/>My funding goal is $25,300. This goal supports graphic design, editing, production, initial business set up, marketing, and the cost of traveling for author events. Funds raised above the goal will be devoted to scoping a potential documentary film called CRAVING THE FUTURE, featuring live interviews with innovation luminaries. </p>
<p><br/><strong>Popular Perks and Fulfillment Timeline </strong><br/>Of course you can get CRAVING THE FUTURE book at a discount here - and it's the only place to get the popular C'EST WHAT? hat. Our feature perk is the <strong>CRAVING COFFEE TALK</strong>, which includes four hard cover books, TWO POUNDS of world class Portland coffee, and a set of conversation starters for you and your friends or co-workers to discuss over coffee while cruising the book together - just $200.  We will fulfill those orders beginning in August so the coffee is fresh!</p>

<p><br/>I think you will also love the <strong>VIRTUAL CRAVING WORKSHOP</strong>, whereby we could devote 90 minutes to discuss the ways CRAVING THE FUTURE can impact your organization or personal lives.... great for teams or even book groups. Even better, a full-blown, multi-sensory innovation workshop for your team to explore future possibilities, priced at a significant discount for Indiegogo patrons - normally $25,000 - available for $9,500. </p>

<p>I  have devoted tremendous personal energy to this project because I have learned that many people feel the future happens TO them, rather than for or with them. CRAVING THE FUTURE can help I believe that  curiosity and empathy together can lead you down a pathway to soulfulness, helping you create a future that has<strong> meaning, purpose and prosperity. </strong></p>
<p>But, humbly speaking, this is my first book so I am grateful for your engagement. I hope this book is a <strong>catalyst for  you to create what is next. </strong></p>

My name is Michael Perman. I am an innovation futurist and head of C'EST WHAT? - the Mindful Innovation firm.  After decades of deep research around the world, I have distilled my accumulated wisdom into a new book, podcast series, action learning tools and innovation experiences called CRAVING THE FUTURE.  
 

 
My mission in life is to inspire creativity in people, to help everyone create a brighter future for themselves and the organizations where they work - instead of being controlled by outside forces.  Today, I am inviting you to join the the movement of people who wish to take the future into their hands and own it!
You've never seen a business book quite like this one, mindfully crafted as a collaborative and interactive tool that enables people and organizations to see over the horizon...and shape their destiny. 
CRAVING THE FUTURE gives you powerful ideas, practical skills and expert advice from innovation luminaries who are paving the way forward, making the world a better place. 
But it's more than a book - it's a new way of thinking about creating what's next!

Early Reviews:
The future has a strange power over us. It causes deep anxiety and, at the same time, a magical attraction. I've been impressed with how Michael has always been able to balance these two emotions not only for himself but also for the organizations he has worked with, bringing lightness, hope and curiosity. In CRAVING THE FUTURE, Michael shares his learning and insights in a deeply powerful and useful way. Let him be your guide to a beautiful future.

<h3>“Marie Antoinette’s Watch is a wonderful book.” – William Gibson, author of Neuromancer.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Across continents and into and out of the hands of royalty, revolutionaries, smugglers, thieves, and the world’s greatest tech engineers, was Marie Antoinette’s watch, the “160,” worth an estimated $40 million in today’s dollars. Perhaps the most sought after personal technology device of the last 200 years, the timepiece, designed by the legendary Abraham-Louis Breguet, is the launching point for a thrilling and fluidly woven set of narratives that are, in part, forbidden love story, historical document, and police procedural. Marie Antoinette’s Watch also deftly lays out the history of horology and the 18th Century engineering feats attained in Paris’s answer to Silicon Valley, the Île de la Cité, that made the watch the most intricate and prized personal device of its time – something that’s come full circle today. In the hands of Techcrunch’s East Coast Editor, John Biggs, Marie Antoinette’s Watch is by turns edifying and lurid, historical and utterly modern. Culminating in a heist in a Tel Aviv antiquities museum in the 1980s, Biggs tells the story of how one object can transform countries, cultures, high technology, and time itself.</p>

Hi, I'm John Biggs. I wrote a book called Marie Antoinette's Watch, a book about one of the most incredible watches ever made. It took 50 years to build and everyone involved in its manufactured died before they saw it finished. It's sailed the seas of time for over two centuries and it was recently recovered after years hidden away in a thief's private stash. It's an incredible story. 
I've been selling the paperback for a few years now but people have asked me for an audiobook version. With the help of my friend Rick Barr we've decided to release one.  
What are we trying to do? We are going to record and master a professional quality reading of the book and release it in MP3, CD, and, possibly, podcast format.  We will also put the audiobook on Amazon.
You can read the book for free on Kindle Unlimited here and on Wattpad here.

About The Book

 
“Marie Antoinette’s Watch is a wonderful book.” – William Gibson, author of Neuromancer.
 
Across continents and into and out of the hands of royalty, revolutionaries, smugglers, thieves, and the world’s greatest tech engineers, was Marie Antoinette’s watch, the “160,” worth an estimated $40 million in today’s dollars. Perhaps the most sought after personal technology device of the last 200 years, the timepiece, designed by the legendary Abraham-Louis Breguet, is the launching point for a thrilling and fluidly woven set of narratives that are, in part, forbidden love story, historical document, and police procedural. Marie Antoinette’s Watch also deftly lays out the history of horology and the 18th Century engineering feats attained in Paris’s answer to Silicon Valley, the Île de la Cité, that made the watch the most intricate and prized personal device of its time – something that’s come full circle today. In the hands of Techcrunch’s East Coast Editor, John Biggs, Marie Antoinette’s Watch is by turns edifying and lurid, historical and utterly modern. Culminating in a heist in a Tel Aviv antiquities museum in the 1980s, Biggs tells the story of how one object can transform countries, cultures, high technology, and time itself.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Clifford Myers, a local comedian from Hamilton, Ontario. (Most) Comedians have a rare gift to see the world differently. They can scrutinize and satire anything. I believe using laughter to ""open peoples eyes"" is a good thing if you have the gift. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I don't have that gift. I have the gift of making people laugh but that's where the buck stops. There's no message. No secret agenda. I do it for the sake of getting in a room full of people and giving us all the chance to laugh together. To get away from whatever problems we dealt with that day. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For a link to my comedy please visit: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRiuMlzKVY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRiuMlzKVY</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But just because I don't make a difference on stage (this is arguable) doesn't mean I don't want to make a difference. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I came home after another show and thought to myself, ""What else can I apply my writing to? How can use what gifts I got to do something better?""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The next morning I woke reminded of the timelessness of Robert Munsch and Dr. Seuss. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And I sat at my computer and wrote 'The Cheese Baron'. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style="""">My Other Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The more important story, the story to why you're here is about a little boy known simply as The Cheese Baron. The Cheese Baron. (need I say it?), loves his cheese. He puts Steve Urkel to shame. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But he doesn't fit in at school. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>School has classes full of numbers and other classes full of words. But the Cheese Baron doesn't see the point to words and numbers, all he knows is that he loves cheese. ""Too bad we can't take a class on cheese..."" </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I want you to join the Cheese Baron as he wanders away from a world of numbers and words and into a magical cheese fort full of kids just like him.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But maybe even paradise has its flaws. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You personally have already experienced the impact. Children emerge themselves in stories. Stories with lessons and principles that help them develop through the early years of childhood. The best part is children remember these stories.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is why I want them to remember 'The Cheese Baron'. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Because it's about not fitting in. Something about you makes you different. You have a different culture, a different religion, everyone likes sports and you like art, every likes art and you like sports (in what world?), you look different, you think different, you were raised different, and all a kid wants at the end of the day is to fit in.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But fitting in isn't compromising who you are it's fitting in who you are to where you are.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>First and foremost, thanks to anyone who took the time to view my project.  I was motivated by a few close friends who enlightened me on crowd funding to create this campaign.  The day I finished the rough draft for this novel was one of the best days of my life.  Since then, I’ve spent more time editing and rewriting my story than it took for me to write the initial copy.  I love this book.  The novel is everything I’ve ever wanted in a story, and now I’m looking for a way to share it with others. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I started writing, I had no motive.  Within a short four months I finished the first copy and asked myself what to do next.  For four months, I was excited to go home and write.  I was excited to go back into the world I had created, and it’s set in the one we live in today. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The two most frequent things I’ve heard from my friends who’ve read Noble are…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I feel like this could be real.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“**** that ending blew my mind and I did not see that coming!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                I laughed pretty hard the first time I heard that.</p>
<p>               I am a pilot in the early days of my career, and I don’t make very much money…  I received a quote from a copy editor to work on my novel and it was 1400 dollars.  Not really pocket change for a man who wrestles with student loans.  But beside that, the 450 for the book design and page layout, and the money I’ve already spent on printing copies and shipping, I want to use any extra funding I receive to print as many copies as I can for a first printing.  I’ve written proposals and query letters for publishing houses and book agents, but I simply need the funding to accomplish it all.  I’m taking this chance in my life to do something extraordinary and I’m not the type to quit.  I want to succeed like any other writer who puts himself and his work out into the world.  So below I’ve laid out the proposed back cover for my book, some information I wrote about myself that I used in one of my proposals, and the prologue. Enjoy! And thanks for looking!</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>Prologue:</strong><strong style=""font-size: 10px;""> </strong></p>
<p><strong>            </strong>At the corner of a narrow cobblestone alleyway, a young girl tended a rare patch of flowers that had taken root between a pair of run-down residential buildings. The cotton hem of her plain dress brushed the stones of the street as she swayed back and forth with a pail of water, gently pouring among the frail petals of blues and yellows. Her dress hung loosely off one shoulder, her tan skin flushed from the heat. The world depression had affected Western Europe early on, and ever since, flowers were scarce in Paris. It had been weeks since the last rain.</p>
<p>            The girl hummed, her blond hair dangled over her shoulders as the occasional car passed by dangerously close. The girl lived for flowers and often dreamt that one day she would have a garden full of them. Her ears twitched as she heard the soft treading of boots; the footsteps were unsteady and out of rhythm. As she leaned over the flowers, she ignored the man who appeared from a narrow pathway. He stopped before he reached her, calling out to her roughly. His French accent was thick, and his breath reeked of cheap wine.</p>
<p>“<em>Bonjour</em>, what is such a young beauty doing alone?”</p>
<p>            The man spoke slowly. His body swayed as his eyes searched the alleyway.</p>
<p>“Are your parents not around?”</p>
<p>             The girl glanced at the man without interest, her hair falling forward as she turned back to the flowers. The man’s face went rigid.</p>
<p>“You know, it is rude, little girl, when you do not answer a man.”</p>
<p>             His arm reached out to grab the girl by the shoulder, a hand seizing his wrist hard just before he touched her.</p>
<p>“<em>Excusez-moi</em>. What makes you think this girl is alone?”</p>
<p>             The man winced as nails dug sharply into his wrist.</p>
<p>“May I ask what business you have with her, <em>monsieur</em>?”</p>
<p>             The Frenchman recoiled, drawing his wrist back in pain. He was surprised to find another young girl standing next to him. She looked not a day over fifteen. The man balked, confused by the strength with which she had grabbed his arm. She stood defiantly between him and the little girl still humming softly near the flowers. The older girl’s hair was dark and wild, her green eyes narrowed as she looked at the man with disgust. He hesitated under her stare, but recovered a moment later. His face smoothed over, trying to hide his embarrassment that a teenage girl had startled him. His brow furrowed in anger, and he spread his feet as he steadied himself.</p>
<p>“Who do you think you are, <em>fille</em>? I should put you and the brat behind you over my knee and we’ll see. …”</p>
<p>“<em>Ce qui semble </em><em>être le probl</em><em>ême</em>?”</p>
<p>              The air stirred. The strength of the voice hit the Frenchman like a wave, taking him by surprise. He stumbled as he whipped around and fell hard on his backside. Turning over on the cobblestones, he saw a young man stepping out of a humming car, another teenager stepping out behind him. The Frenchman licked his cracked lips, eyes wide as he took stock of the two and the strange, vibrating car that appeared silently. They stood tall in front of him, their appearances strong. The first young man was dressed in a plain black suit without a tie, a gleaming chain bearing a strange cross hanging around his neck. His face was expressionless. The teenage boy came up quickly behind him, his eyes threatening, his voice filled with the same depth and power.</p>
<p>“We’ve had a long journey and we have little patience. Leave now. It will be one of your better decisions.”</p>
<p>              The teenage boy’s piercing dark blue eyes silenced the man as he looked down on him. The Frenchman fumbled backward on his elbows, struggling to come to his feet before running down the alleyway in the direction he had come. When the little girl finally looked up, her face glowed with excitement.</p>
<p>“Adalric! Niles! You’ve been gone so long, <em>tu m’as manquee</em>!”</p>
<p>              She ran forward, almost tripping over her feet as she came to embrace the young man around his legs, the chain around his neck hanging in the air as he leaned forward. Adalric remained expressionless, his tone disapproving.</p>
<p>“Julia, what have we told you about leaving the house? It is dangerous to be alone in the city the way it is now.”</p>
<p>              Her feet brushed the stone, her face crestfallen.</p>
<p>“<em>Je suis d</em><em>êsole</em>. But the flowers, the flowers were <em>thirsty</em>! They told me so, and they are so pretty. I couldn’t let them die!”</p>
<p>              Adalric gave her a small smile, then turned to the girl with the wild hair. He nodded thoughtfully toward her.</p>
<p>“Mabelle, it is wonderful to see you again. May I introduce my younger brother. This is Niles.”</p>
<p>              Niles smiled genially as he extended his hand.</p>
<p>“It is a pleasure to meet you, <em>mademoiselle</em>.”</p>
<p>              Mabelle pursed her lips, folding her arms and showing no inclination to take his hand. Niles pulled away, his cheeks growing red under her stare. She looked at them both disapprovingly.</p>
<p>“Do you know what could have happened if I hadn’t been here? Who knows what that man could have done to her! Where would you have been?”</p>
<p>              Adalric bowed his head.</p>
<p>“You are right. I will have a talk with Ethel, the matron, when we return home. Thank you for being here.”</p>
<p>              He turned to the little girl, Julia, taking one of her hands.</p>
<p>“This is Mabelle, Julia. She will be staying with us for a while.”</p>
<p>              The girl looked down shyly, her hands holding on to Adalric’s jacket pocket. Mabelle’s stern expression relaxed and she walked forward to kneel in front of her.</p>
<p>“<em>Bonjour</em>, Julia, my name is Mabelle. I would like it very much if we might become friends. I can even help you water the flowers whenever you want.”</p>
<p>              Mabelle extended her hands. Julia’s face spread in a wide smile as she offered her own, nodding enthusiastically. Niles fidgeted beside them, scratching the back of his head and smiling apologetically.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mabelle. It is a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p>              Mabelle stood up straight, flashing Niles another disapproving look, then turned.</p>
<p>“So how long will you be staying <em>this</em> time, Adalric Vanlare?”</p>
<p>              Adalric looked up pensively into the dense clouds of pollution that hung thick over the city.</p>
<p>“Niles will be staying to look after things here for a while. Regretfully, I will only be staying for the night. The world has done too much damage to itself. There’s much to be done. We need to help while there is still a chance for us to do so.”</p>
<p>              Adalric helped Julia into the car. Mabelle followed in silence. Gently closing the door, he turned toward Niles.</p>
<p>“We Noble will no longer be able to remain isolated. It is time again we enter the world.”</p>

<h3> </h3></div>","Hi!
 
First and foremost, thanks to anyone who took the time to view my project.  I was motivated by a few close friends who enlightened me on crowd funding to create this campaign.  The day I finished the rough draft for this novel was one of the best days of my life.  Since then, I’ve spent more time editing and rewriting my story than it took for me to write the initial copy.  I love this book.  The novel is everything I’ve ever wanted in a story, and now I’m looking for a way to share it with others. 
 
When I started writing, I had no motive.  Within a short four months I finished the first copy and asked myself what to do next.  For four months, I was excited to go home and write.  I was excited to go back into the world I had created, and it’s set in the one we live in today. 
 
The two most frequent things I’ve heard from my friends who’ve read Noble are…
 
“I feel like this could be real.”
 
“**** that ending blew my mind and I did not see that coming!”
 
                I laughed pretty hard the first time I heard that.
               I am a pilot in the early days of my career, and I don’t make very much money…  I received a quote from a copy editor to work on my novel and it was 1400 dollars.  Not really pocket change for a man who wrestles with student loans.  But beside that, the 450 for the book design and page layout, and the money I’ve already spent on printing copies and shipping, I want to use any extra funding I receive to print as many copies as I can for a first printing.  I’ve written proposals and query letters for publishing houses and book agents, but I simply need the funding to accomplish it all.  I’m taking this chance in my life to do something extraordinary and I’m not the type to quit.  I want to succeed like any other writer who puts himself and his work out into the world.  So below I’ve laid out the proposed back cover for my book, some information I wrote about myself that I used in one of my proposals, and the prologue. Enjoy! And thanks for looking!
Enter the world of the Noble, a secret society representing human potential while shadowing the world throughout history—only to emerge when the world is on the verge of collapse.

A family and a past, both unknown to him, thrust him into the world of the Noble, an ancient race that represents the potential in all of us.

I want this book to be shareable and available to all as an eBook, as well as a print copy. This Common Book will be considered open source, public domain, and can be widely shared. I feel that this is an important time in our history and we are at a crossroads. </p>
<p>In the legal world of Copyrights, Trademarks, and Digital Rights, we are facing a more restrictive future of written, audio and video based materials, and how they may be used. This bears directly on our freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of use. In order to avoid these restrictions, I see the Common Book of Wicca and Witchcraft as able to bypass most of the problems with copyright issues. This will give my fellow Wiccans, Witches, and Seekers the freedom to teach, with quality materials, the basics of our faith. My hope is that you will want this for yourself and your family as well. </p>
<p>Why Wicca? For me, once I accepted Wicca, it changed and saved my life. From my soul, my inner self, I felt healing and understanding that nothing else was ever able to answer, and I discovered how beautiful the natural world is. Being Wiccan as well as a Witch was life affirming and comforting in so many places in my life. It gave me the freedom to believe as I wanted, and since then, I have dedicated myself to teaching. The Common Book of Wicca and Witchcraft is the next step in what I believe can help bring comfort and understanding to so many others. </p>
<p><br/><strong>The Problem:</strong> </p>
<p>The current teaching manuals of any coven, circle or temple, unless they are using their own personal Book of Shadows, have to be purchased from a publisher, who originally printed them for the authors. This is a great system that has served us well for the past 70 years, and it was the best available way for us while we were unable to connect with each other. But, it has also left many of our faith practices and rituals to fall under copyright, and they can be shared only under certain narrow conditions.  I suspect the constant drum of corporations to protect intellectual property could make it much more difficult to use any copyrighted material beyond the scope of reading and practice. <br/>For instance, in 2012, one of our most beloved chants was used freely and incorporated many derivative works. This open sharing angered the original author of the chant, and she actively sought to narrow the usage, and eliminate the various other forms of the chant. She was able to do so because the chant was copyrighted in the seventies, and most people were just not aware of that. This is just one example of the unexpected consequences of copyrights and their impact on the community<br/>This is why we want to have a book of common knowledge that allows covens, circles, witan shrines, temples, and groves to teach at least the basics to people who want to learn.  This has always been our goal; to provide an education to anyone, anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>All materials will be derived from common knowledge, research, and properly annotated and referenced sources. We will have a review panel to ensure the material does not violate copyrights of any authors or publishers.  If we are required to have permission to print, we will either acquire permission or we will remove the passages that violate copyright. This is very important in creating shareable material.</p>
<p><b>What will be the Content of Book?</b><br/>  The quality of the book will be determined by the authors, seeking to express common knowledge in a way that does not violate any copyrights currently held by any author or publisher currently. We have a great team to start, and we will be accepting the best of our community to help with this project  We anticipate that this will be well-structured and very inclusive. The first table of contents, is History, Holidays, Traditions &amp; Beliefs, Rituals, Spells, Prayers &amp; Chants and Skills.  We will also include a glossary/dictionary and a bibliography. <br/><br/>The materials in the book will be of quality, vetted by sharp-eyed and knowledgeable elders, and will be based on the submissions we receive. We have a basic structure today with enough material to start, and we will only add to the depth and beauty of the Craft. . <br/><b><br/>First Edition Hardcover Edition: </b><br/>We are going to have the Hardcover books made by a small press here in Chicago, Il. We will make as only as many as we have perks and prepaid orders, plus a small amount for authors and gifts.  This will give you a beautiful book, that will be a certified first edition, with all the errors, mistakes, and before inevitable changes will occur. This is the nature of printing, and we will produce to our market and limit the final number created to actual demand.  Everyone who receives the first edition will also receive the eBook as well. <br/><b><br/>Paperback Edition:</b><br/>This will be the largest possible run we can make, in the format which can get us the most number of quality copies. The current plan is to create a trade paperback edition at 1000 copies, with the $20,000 goal.  If we do not meet that goal, we will use small press printers to make as many copies as we need to meet the demand. Everyone who receives a paperpack edition will also receive the eBook as well. <br/><b><br/>eBook Edition: </b><br/>As we move into the Digital age, this edition will not be constrained to the same size as print, and will be able to have a larger amount of material. It will have a identical copy of the printed book, and a extended part with additional material created. This is a more fluid format in setting up, and when created will be the easiest shared.  Every perk, excluding handmade bookmark, will include the eBook. <br/><br/><b>eBook Update, Creating Links in eBooks:</b><br/>November 4th, update<br/><br/>In discussing the eBook, we are able to create links, and this will allow us to connect to thousands of other pages. We are building this to be read on any platform including tablets, Kindles, and any way one wants to read their digital materials. In this, we will be able to give authors and writers ways to build in hyperlinks in their writings,  as well as automatically for certain wordsets, and create a referral service that can connect to other online libraries such as Sacred Text,  Library of Congress, and virtually the whole of humanities public libraries to tap into. We can incorporate video and audio into the eBook. <br/><br/>In this sense the eBook will be a gateway into the world of Witchcraft and Wicca, on a spiritual and virtual levels, driving everyone to seek out physical experiences, building community.  The quality of the links will depend on finding sites that will help them become part of the community.  <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>The Process:</strong> </p>
<p>We are seeking to create both a digital eBook and also a bound book that covers the basic teachings of Wicca and Witchcraft. We are planning to take one year to write and acquire the needed materials. </p>
<p>We do have The Super Omnibus of Spells and Incantations for Every Occasion to draw from, created and provided by Don Lewis and Maryann Kay. We will incorporate The Five Mystic Secrets with commentary as well. This will be the start of source material created for the purpose of sharing. </p>
<p>We will hire editors, authors, and researchers as we can to create lessons for the book. We will be creating a physical version that can be shared in whole or in part. We will also have an eBook edition which will be a digital version of the same book, with additional materials that might not be available for the first bound edition. </p>
<p>Everything will be peer reviewed, and searched for plagiarism and other copyright violations. When all materials have been formatted and collated, the completed book will be sent out for printing. The bound version and the eBook will be released simultaneously.  </p>

<p><strike>If we do not make $3,000 we will refund all money, and end the project.</strike></p>
<p>If we make at least $3,000, we will produce the eBook with materials we have at that time. We will hire an editor to help with a volunteer writing group. The paperback will be a comb bound, hand printed book. A hardcover edition will be hand produced. </p>
<p>When we make $5,000 we will print our paperback professionally. </p>
<p>When we raise more than $5,000, we will use most of the money to hire editors, writers, authors, and researchers to produce the best quality material for this project. </p>
<p>With $20,000 we can complete the bound first edition within one year, with basic teachings in a Common Book of Wicca and Witchcraft. </p>
<p>If we reach beyond $20,000 we can add a broader coalition of writers to allow them to do more in-depth lessons. We can hopefully hire university level and professional writers. We can also include more novice writers as well.

<p><strong>Team History:</strong> <br/>Our Team History: We have been public Pagan educators since 1990, beginning with the New Castle Society and the Mirror Coven of Chicago. We have been instrumental in creating wonderful opportunities for people to learn and understand Paganism, with a number of us practicing among other traditions. We have sponsored magazines including The Terminal Journal and Round Table Magazine. We evolved into radio including Psychic Chicago Radio, Telepathic Radio, and currently Pagans Tonight, a seven day a week radio network that just celebrated its four year anniversary with over 1500 shows. </p>
<p>We hosted three Pagan Leadership Conferences of Chicago in 1994. These projects, along with Pagan Expo, launched an active community that lasted through most of the decade, with some of Chicago’s best leaders stepping up to help with expansion and growth. Today Chicago is a community that is learning to live with a new generation that seeks knowledge via the internet.</p>
<p>This project began with The Daily Spell in 1998 and it subsequently became the online website Witch School on September 4th, 2011. This has been a powerful global education resource that offers a free lessons and dozens of courses. Every day, Witch School is doing it’s very best to provide a lifetime of education to anyone, anytime, anywhere. We have thousands of potential teachers globally, ready to teach, if we could supply them with the necessary materials. In the past, Witchcraft, Wicca and Pagan educational programs have often been bootstrap projects. So once again, we ask our fellow Wiccans to help us compile and distribute new and insightful information, so that we can share our experiences, as we learn our history and seek our own path.  Witch School reaches 246,000 members in 207 countries, and offers courses such as Living the Wiccan Life and over 100 more. </p>
<p>We created Magick TV which has video lessons, interviews with Pagan community leaders, and more, including Don Lewis Daily Vlog. We have produced over 2,000 videos since the station opened on November 11th, 2005. We started Pagans Tonight radio on September 15th, 2009. We published The Correllian Times magazine beginning in 2006, with Issue 74 just released.<br/><br/></p>
<p>We have done some large scale projects, and this will be one of our greatest challenges. If we can accomplish this, one year from now we will have reached our goal to continue our focus of a lifelong, open education. We will be able to offer a set of core materials for all teachers to share with everyone; to use with no fear of reprimand or copyright infringement threats. </p></span><p> </p></span></span><p> </p></span><p> </p></span><p> </p></span><p> </p></span></span><p> </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Hi, I am Ed Hubbard, and my project will allow us to create a Common Book of Wicca and Witchcraft.

<p>All is not right in the Otherworld of elves and faeries. Our story begins with a dire warning from Aurali, a broken hearted faery, wise in experience and devoted to her kind. The Light of the Otherworld is quickly fading, for reasons that remain shrouded in mystery. A Great Befalling has scarred the hearts of elves and faeries, and afflicted their minds. They have lost their connection to each other, and the deeper mysteries of their existence – as a result, their lives seem devoid of meaning. The villains of this tragedy have hidden their agenda well. Great lies must be exposed before the Otherworld can be saved. Time is running out to discover the truth; in fact, only one year remains. If both sides do not reconcile their differences, the Light will die, and all will be lost.</p>
<p>Is there anyone who can prevent this from happening?</p>
<p>Enter Baudwin our hero - a water faery from the hamlet of Deuona. Baudwin is a spirited, adventurous soul with a brave heart, and an important destiny he must grow into. He lives with his father and grandfather helping to operate a dam that provides water to neighboring farms. In his spare time, he enjoys collecting Elven Steamway inventions, and performing with his acrobatic troupe. Although he is content with his life on the river, a great mystery pains his heart. His mother has been missing ever since he was born. All he knows is that her disappearance is somehow linked to the Great Befalling. To find her, he must uncover clues left by the woeful calamity that has struck down the elves and faeries. This search will sorely test his resolve, and lead him down an ever more difficult path to re-awaken the realm.</p>
<p>In Secrets of the Rainbow Bridge, Baudwin will join up with loyal friends from every Faery element, and face multiple enemies, with hidden agendas. He will also be forced to choose between the old ways of the Faeries, and the new ways of the Elves. This will not come easily for him. To make the right choice, he will have to contemplate many challenging situations. His quest will force him to change the way he perceives the world around him: allies will seem like enemies, and enemies like allies. He will receive help from unexpected sources, but for the most part he will have to meet the challenge alone.</p>
<p>Time is short and there is much ground to cover. Baudwin has but one year to accomplish his goal, for his journey begins at the start of the Liminal year – a special time between the ages when unusual occurrences are common, and everything becomes possible. Extraordinary events will open opportunities for great change, but they will also come with even greater dangers. Are the events around him part of a greater tapestry that he cannot yet comprehend? Will he succeed in his quest? And are you ready to go with him on his amazing journey?</p>

</div><div>
<div>
<p>In our family, we have had our share of pain and struggle, including periods of unemployment, family illness, failed businesses, and financial instability. When we began working on Secrets of the Rainbow Bridge, all of us felt that our lives had reached an all time low. J.R.R. Tolkien states in The Return of the King that ""Oft hope is born, when all is forlorn."" </p>
<p>For us, when all was forlorn, the Elves and Faeries became our muses. ""Write our story!"" they said. And so we began. The more we collaborated, the better we felt. Having worked together tightly as a creative team for the past four years, our spirits have lifted, our pain is fading, and healing is coming into our lives. </p>
<p>As artists, we want very much to share all of this with you. Through Secrets of the Rainbow Bridge, we would like to show you what the Elves and Faeries are saying, which is that no matter how dark and difficult things may seem, each of us has the power to rise above our greatest challenges, by going deep within. When we find out who we are inside, we can always draw upon the positive, in order to let go of the negative, and find the Light. </p>
<p>With this message in our hearts, we get up everyday, utterly committed to our all important goal, which is to complete our first book. After that, we have five more to go. The Elves and Faeries have a lot to say! With your support, we will be able to continue on this path, which is to provide a deep and uplifting message for our readers. In the process, we will make sure that they are thoroughly entertained!</p>

<p>The

<p>Although the
story is easy to understand, the world is fairly complex, and getting fully immersed takes time. We strove to

between the Elven steampunk (which we call Steamway) civilization, and
the traditional Faery civilization. We expect the story to be understood on many levels, and will be loved by families who want a
magic adventure with drama and depth. </p>

In the final version, we will iron out all the bugs.Your sample has tons of spacing shifts etc on my reader? What gives?Not all readers and formats are created equal. We haven't had any problems with Kindle, or PDF, but some readers on the iPad don't like our document. If you're using an iPad we recommend NeoSoarBook.Hey this map preview looks pretty good. Why would I bother paying you for it?That map preview is merely 20% of the true size. That means the real version is 12,000 by 7,800 pixels. It has much more detail than the sample we are showing, and the same is true for all of our character artwork etc.How long have you been writing this series?For over four years now. The first book should be done around the five year mark.Wow a sixty day campaign? Kinda long don't you think?Not really. If people don't have time to read all ten chapters then they may not feel comfortable backing us. The long window is to give them a little more time, and hopefully tell a friend or two :-)",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Victoria (Vikki) Marie, I am retired from paid work and
serve as volunteer pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Tonantzin
Community.  Recently Scholar's Press asked to publish my doctoral
thesis.  Although written 10 year ago, the work is of current
relevance because it examines sociological factors in
addiction and explores the questions of how powerlessness and
surrender translate into sobriety as well as the motivation to help
others in the recovery process.  
</p>
<p>If I can purchase 20 copies of the book, I can lower
the publishers selling price from $101.85 CAD to $61.35CAD per copy. 
Addiction touches the lives of so many people.  The lower price will
make it more accessible.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>The book, <u>Transforming Addiction: The role of spirituality in
recovery from addiction</u> will be available next month.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I need $1,050 to purchase 20 books
	from the distributor of Scholar's Press books, morebooks.de.   
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal or if I receive more than my
	goal, I will purchase as many books as I can to lower it's retail
	price. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Addiction is a
	problem of concern in many communities around the globe.  Assorted
	strategies have been studied or implemented to address the problem
	with varied amounts of success. This study investigates
	spirituality, a largely unexplored factor in recovery from
	addictions, and its role in the learning processes that transformed
	the participants from addicts to abstainers. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This book will provide new insights into
	addiction issues for health care professionals, spiritual leaders,
	students of the social sciences and anyone concerned about addiction
	and recovery issues.  Your contribution will help me make the book
	accessible to more people.  
	</p>

My name is Victoria (Vikki) Marie, I am retired from paid work and
serve as volunteer pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Tonantzin
Community.  Recently Scholar's Press asked to publish my doctoral
thesis.  Although written 10 year ago, the work is of current
relevance because it examines sociological factors in
addiction and explores the questions of how powerlessness and
surrender translate into sobriety as well as the motivation to help
others in the recovery process.  

If I can purchase 20 copies of the book, I can lower
the publishers selling price from $101.85 CAD to $61.35CAD per copy. 
Addiction touches the lives of so many people.  The lower price will
make it more accessible.
   What We Need & What You Get 
The book, Transforming Addiction: The role of spirituality in
recovery from addiction will be available next month.


I need $1,050 to purchase 20 books
	from the distributor of Scholar's Press books, morebooks.de.   
	


If I don't reach my entire goal or if I receive more than my
	goal, I will purchase as many books as I can to lower it's retail
	price. 
	


  The Impact 


Addiction is a
	problem of concern in many communities around the globe.  Assorted
	strategies have been studied or implemented to address the problem
	with varied amounts of success. This study investigates
	spirituality, a largely unexplored factor in recovery from
	addictions, and its role in the learning processes that transformed
	the participants from addicts to abstainers. 
	


This book will provide new insights into
	addiction issues for health care professionals, spiritual leaders,
	students of the social sciences and anyone concerned about addiction
	and recovery issues.  Your contribution will help me make the book
	accessible to more people.  
	


  Risks & Challenges  
The only risk is not reaching my goal.  If I don't I will purchase
as many book as I can to lower the retail price.

<p>Hi, I’m Darcelle, the Editor-in-chief for a <strong>magazine about wellness, recreation, culture and travel, called <em>Infinity Magazine</em>. </strong></p>

We all want to help, but we can't do it alone. Please consider donating enough to pay for his airfare over to the Low Countries.
THIS IS A SECRET: BARRY DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS.
We hope that you will consider donating--furthermore if you want to help us with incentives to help others donate, please let us know.

Respecto a los exámenes efectuados acerca de la psicología del individuo solo pudo colegirse de ésta que era turbulenta, confusa y la mayoría de las veces su psique parecía tener querencia a separarse del cauce de la realidad objetiva»
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 960€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de El caso Teselas que saldría después a la venta.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Alfonso Cuenca vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

<h3>Who are we? </h3>
<p>We are three mental health advocates: Hattie Gladwell, James Conlon and Anneli Roberts, starting an online mental health publication for people with mental illness - and those interested in mental illness - BY people with mental illness. We will share mental health pieces from experienced and new writers, offering opinion pieces, personal essays, mental health news, studies, listicles and more. </p>
<p>We want to showcase people's talent, and remind mental health writers that their work is worthy of being paid for.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise £5,000 so that we can create a big enough budget to promote our website, PAY our writers (something that a lot of people don't do when it comes to mental health writing) and make sure we can bring you the best content. To be transparent, we are taking a lot of time to launch and edit and make sure the website is the best it can be for you all, and so we need to make some money from it ourselves. We are also looking at marketing costs, sponsorships - but really we just want to be able to share the stories of as many mental health writers as possible, and make sure they are compensated for their time, effort and talent. </p>
<p>If you donate, you will get exclusive access to a mental health newsletter written by Anneli, James and Hattie, and you will also get an early look at the launch of the website, plus weekly updates on writers we've got onboard and pieces to look forward to.</p>
<p>You will also get to read three exclusive pieces over the next month, before they are launched online. </p>
<p>If we don't meet the funding goal, we will use what we have raised to pay as many writers as possible, and to get the website out there with promotion. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We think this is an important project for many. There are little publications out there - with the exception of a few - focusing mainly on mental health and everything that incorporates it - including physical health, dating, sex, friendships, worklife and more. And our niche? We are only commissioning those with experience of mental illness - whether that be suffering themselves, or experience of someone else suffering.</p>
<p>There are so many mental health writers out there who don't get the opportunity to share their work - or don't get paid for it - and we want to change that. We want to show writers that their work is amazing, and most of all, appreciated, and worthy of fair pay. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate, don't worry! We thank you for your time reading this. If you would like to help us out though, please do share our campaign and encourage other people to donate. We will love you for it! </p>

<p>Many people know about the <strong>Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962</strong> when it was by pure chance that a nuclear war between the USA and the USSR did not start. Only two hours before the war was to begin, the White House finally received a telegram from Moscow. Immediately following that, President Kennedy canceled the invasion of Cuba, where 40 thousand Soviet troops and missiles with nuclear warheads were deployed. The confrontation was caused by the Soviet Union secretly deploying ballistic missiles in Cuba and aiming them at 60 major US cities.</p>

American generals and politicians did not know about that, and they insisted that President Kennedy order an airstrike on those missiles. Only the patience of the President of the United States saved the whole world from a nuclear war. Otherwise, about seven thousand missiles with nuclear warheads would have taken off. The USSR and Europe would have been completely destroyed, and the United States would have been partially affected. That is, about 50 million people could have died.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610382664/debhxfwdssraaryzrmpf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As far as the United States is concerned, I found enough material here to write this novel. Yet in the USSR, everything was classified and I had to collect the information bit by bit. The peculiarity of this novel is that I create a complete picture of those troubling days, both in the White House and in the Kremlin.

<h3>Twilight's List: Third Print Run</h3>
<div>Kittyhawk, aka Kits, here again. Thanks to the desire and fervor of a person who wishes to remain anonymous, I'm once again doing a print run on <a href=""http://www.fimfiction.net/story/21583/twilights-list"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twilight's List</a>.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It's been nearly three years since I ran the first print run of </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">List</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> that garnered around 45 orders. In the years since, I've gotten a few sporadic requests for copies of the book. While I had extras, I ran out of stock about a year ago. Last week, a person who dearly wanted a copy of the book was confronted with a choice: print a one-off (at around $180) or attempt to get another print run done. He (she?) got enough interest going that I decided to attempt to get a third printing off the ground.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is a campaign to raise the money needed to order a print run. I'm expecting around 20 orders, and attempting to balance the price-per-copy around that. If I get them, this will raise the total orders for <i>List</i> to around 70. Frankly, that is astonishing.I'm totally humbled by the fact that people love this story enough to want to pay for a print copy. The fact that there is <i>still </i>demand four years after it was published just blows my mind. This is for you guys as much as it is for me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With that in mind, this is, again, a one-off print run. I'll be collecting the capital to buy the books, pay shipping, and then send them on out to the purchasers. I may purchase a few copies to hold against future demand, but I won't be opening a storefront or anything.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>If you're unfamiliar with <i><a href=""http://www.fimfiction.net/story/21583/twilights-list"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twilight's List</a>,</i> then you should know you that you can read it at the link above for the mere cost of viewing the hosting site's ads. You don't need an account or anything. (Also, HI.

<div>For $45 + shipping, you'll get the following</div>

</ul>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Right now, Shipping is based on a weight of 1 lbs and my experience sending out the first two print runs. I've done $5 for US?Canada and $10 for Europe.

<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>According to the documentation on this site, it might take up to 15 days to actually get the money from Indiegogo. So after the campaign ends, I'll post updates on what they tell me about the funds. When I have them, I'll fire off the order to Book1one. Last time, it took them about 3 weeks to get me my books. I've no clue what their queue is like these days. I'll keep this site updated with news as I hear about it. I'll start creating packing slips the day I order the books, so they should be ready to go once I receive them. I'll send them out in groups: one international, one domestic. I'll email everyone the tracking number (which may or may not do you a lot of good if you're not in the US) so you can see where your package is. All told, it might be up to 9 weeks from the start of this campaign until you get the book. Sorry for the long lead time.</p>

</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why So Expensive?</h3>
<div>If you've never delved into the world of quality printing, it's not a cheap process. Especially for small book runs like this. I use Book1one to do small print runs, and am very happy with the <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/OhCyl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">result</a>, but it's not cheap. Each additional book ordered will reduce the price per book by a little, but it's not a plate-process. I'd need to get several hundred orders (300+) to make that a viable plan. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Since I can not comprehend a successful campaign for the above case, I'm sticking to a very high quality, non-plate process. They output is indistinguishable from any of the hardbacks I've bought from Amazon or brick and mortar book stores. The ink is very dark, the paper is actually on the higher quality side of what I own, and there is no ""transparency"" issues with seeing text through the page. I also have not had any ink smudge due to sweaty fingers.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The book is standard hardback size (9.25""x6.25"", as I recall), and has 157 numbered pages in 12 chapters. Page numbers follow standard book conventions and all that jazz. I make use of running chapter titles, fancy section separators, and a custom page footer.  I've linked it a few times already, but I have <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/OhCyl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a gallery of images of what the book looks like</a>. The only differences between this copy and the depicted one, will be the cloth cover color; I'll use a different option than from the first edition.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The <a href=""http://sta.sh/28j778hgivh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">interior and cover art</a> can be viewed online. <a href=""http://fav.me/d74xdqn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A trimmed version of the PDF used for printing</a> is also available. It lacks the blank end-leaves, the attribution notice, and the padding needed for binding, but it generated from the same project files as the copy I send to the publisher. I will be updating the afterwards for this edition as well.</div>
<div>As for shipping, I've used USPS to generate prices for a 1 Lbs rigid 10x8 envelope and that these are the nearest-dollar prices it spat out. Shipping got expensive at some point. Sorry.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>So yeah, I've looked at this PDF about 300 times since it was first generated, and another 20 or so for the second print run. Even now, years later, I still find myself glazing over re-reading it. Anyone who wants to send in grammar, typos, or other derps is not only welcomed to, but encouraged. I'll give it a few more passes since I charging people money for it again, but many eyes shallow errors make, right?</p>

I've been collecting testimonies from Maya survivors of the Guatemalan civil war for the past 10 years. In 2009 I published a book of these testimonies in Spanish, ""Cual guerra? Testimonios de sobrevivientes Mayas"" and in 2010 the book was published in the US (""What War? Testimonies of Maya Survivors""). </p>
<p>I am raising money now to publish a new book of testimonies in Spanish titled ""Guerra inconclusa: La voz de sobrevientes"" (""Unfinished War:The Voice of Survivors""). I decided to write this book because recently the Guatemalan government issued a proclamation declaring that genocide had never taken place in Guatemala. This new book will make public more survivors' stories of displacement, terror and murder to counter this official denial.</p>
<p>It is critically important that the reality of survivors' experiences be added to the public record. This history will also serve to educate young Guatemalans who did not live during this period. These testimonies will help break the culture of silence which still exists in Guatemala today.</p>
<p>My previous book,  ""Cual guerra? Testimonies de sobreviventes Mayas"" has been very meaningful to individuals whose stories have been published as it serves to validate the reality of their experiences.

<p>There is a long tradition of art, of poetry,
of music, of the making of beautiful things, that runs through multiple
generations of the De Paz family. And at the center of this tradition is the
late Oscar dePaz, father, grandfather, great grandfather, and poet patriarch,
unwavering patriot, ‘poet laureate’ of Jayuya, Puerto Rico, bohemian, baseball
lover and, as remembered by his grandchildren, master maker of bistec and habichuellas.
Romantic, a dreamer of beauty. </p>
<p>To honor his memory and in gratitude for
Oscar’s inspiration to two generations of artists, musicians and poets, his son
Gilberto de Paz has put to music a choice selection of his best poems in a
beautifully arranged CD, a just and proper tribute to the patriarch of our
family artistic tradition. </p>
<p>The CD will be presented in April 2015 in an
event at the historic Thomas Center in Gainesville, Florida. For that occasion,
we want to publish a small poem book that will bring together a select sample
of his poems, including the ones selected for the CD, for participants in this
presentation, which we expect to be a beautiful evening of music, poetry and
art - a modest endeavor to honor a man that infused a modest life with an epic
zest and modeled the poet and artist to his grateful children and
grandchildren. Books that are not distributed the night of the event, will be
available in local independent bookstores.</p>
<p><b>Risks and challenges</b></p>
<p>The CD
is recorded and published. The book is laid out. We just need your help to take
it to the printer. We are only waiting for your support!</p><p><br/></p><p>

Abril 2015 en un evento histórico en el Thomas Center de Gainesville, Florida.
Para acompañar la presentación del CD y ayudar a dar a conocer su poesía,
queremos juntar en un modesto poemario una muestra selecta de lo mejor de su
poesía, incluyendo los poemas seleccionados para el CD, para completar lo que
esperamos será una bella noche de música, poesía y arte.  Los poemarios que no se distribuyan la noche

<p></p></div>","There is a long tradition of art, of poetry,
of music, of the making of beautiful things, that runs through multiple
generations of the De Paz family. And at the center of this tradition is the
late Oscar dePaz, father, grandfather, great grandfather, and poet patriarch,
unwavering patriot, ‘poet laureate’ of Jayuya, Puerto Rico, bohemian, baseball
lover and, as remembered by his grandchildren, master maker of bistec and habichuellas.
Romantic, a dreamer of beauty. 
To honor his memory and in gratitude for
Oscar’s inspiration to two generations of artists, musicians and poets, his son
Gilberto de Paz has put to music a choice selection of his best poems in a
beautifully arranged CD, a just and proper tribute to the patriarch of our
family artistic tradition. 
The CD will be presented in April 2015 in an
event at the historic Thomas Center in Gainesville, Florida. For that occasion,
we want to publish a small poem book that will bring together a select sample
of his poems, including the ones selected for the CD, for participants in this
presentation, which we expect to be a beautiful evening of music, poetry and
art - a modest endeavor to honor a man that infused a modest life with an epic
zest and modeled the poet and artist to his grateful children and
grandchildren. Books that are not distributed the night of the event, will be
available in local independent bookstores.
Risks and challenges
The CD
is recorded and published. The book is laid out. We just need your help to take
it to the printer. We are only waiting for your support!
Para honrar el recuerdo y
el legado de inspiración del poeta jayuyano Oscar de Paz, su hijo Gilberto de
Paz ha musicalizado una selección de su poesía en un CD con arreglos de Amaury Lopez
Jackson.
El CD se presentará en
Abril 2015 en un evento histórico en el Thomas Center de Gainesville, Florida.
Para acompañar la presentación del CD y ayudar a dar a conocer su poesía,
queremos juntar en un modesto poemario una muestra selecta de lo mejor de su
poesía, incluyendo los poemas seleccionados para el CD, para completar lo que
esperamos será una bella noche de música, poesía y arte.  Los poemarios que no se distribuyan la noche
de la presentación se distribuirán localmente en librerías independientes. Una
modesta propuesta en honor de quien vivió y modeló para sus agradecidos hijos y
nietos el alma del poeta y el artista.
Un donativo a cualquier nivel
será enormemente agradecido, pero también ofrecemos premios a varios niveles
para aquellos de ustedes que quieran acompañarnos más generosamente en esta

Contiene 26 páginas y la portada será de tapa dura.                        Definitivamente existen intereses que no desean que nuestros niños aprendan a reflexionar, sólo desean robots programados que sigan haciendo funcionar el sistema. Las grandes editoriales de libros infantiles, las que distribuyen el 90% de los libros que están en las tiendas, no quieren ofrecerle a los niños libros con mensajes.En nuestras manos está poder darle una alternativa de lectura a estos niños. Ofrecerle libros infantiles que tengan un mensaje que vibre en la misma frecuencia en la que se encuentran ellos. Para las ilustraciones de este libro hemos aplicado las mismas técnicas que se utilizan en la industria del cine y la televisión. Primero se crearon los escenarios, luego se ubicaron las luces para la iluminación y por último las cámaras. Para cada situación de la historia se realizó una puesta en escena y luego se seleccionó la mejor toma de cámara. En pocas palabras todo lo que ustedes ven en las ilustraciones del libro, existe en forma virtual.

                   


El monto recaudado se utilizará en la impresión de la primera edición del libro que consta de 1000 ejemplares. Igualmente pagaremos los servicios de distribución y mercadeo a una compañía americana que posee una amplia red de distribución en las diferentes tiendas de Estados Unidos. Si el monto alcanzado lo permite, también publicaremos el libro en inglés. 

El libro se mandará a imprimir aproximadamente el 30 de Enero de 2015.  (Debemos esperar a que Indiegogo nos haga la transferencia). Según nuestros cálculos debemos estar recibiendo la producción completa de esta primera edición a finales del mes de febrero 2015.  Sin embargo estos tiempos pueden variar, todo depende del término acordado por la imprenta al momento de hacer la orden de impresión.

Las recompensas que no incluyan el libro físico se comenzarán a enviar el 21 de enero de 2014. Las recompensas que sí incluyan el libro físico se comenzarán a enviar una vez que hayamos recibido los libros impresos.ACUERDO PARA VENEZUELA:
Logramos un acuerdo con la compañía directobox.net y el envío del libro físico a Venezuela solo costará $6. 





El 10% de la producción total del libro se donará a bibliotecas públicas para que el mensaje del libro le llegue a la mayor cantidad de niños posible.

<h3>Who I am and why I'm making this book...<br/>
</h3>
<span>Hi! I'm Alex Wallman, creator of Our 
Mirror Book. Throughout
 my career I've worked on a lot of projects helping people, animals and the 
environment. I've done things as diverse as driving a ship through 
Antarctica to protect whales, to making communications about the health 
risks of drinking too much soda. These projects have been with groups and individuals as diverse as Sea Shepherd, Greenpeace, Yosi Sergeant (formerly of The White House's Office of Public Liaison), The California Endowment, and Richard Branson's Carbon War Room.<br/><br/>Being involved in various forms of activism and art led me to wonder how I could be best put to use in creating positive change.</span> And Our Mirror Book is the result of this thinking. Our Mirror Book aims to help kids help themselves, and inspire them to 'be the change they wish to see in the world'. It shows us that life isn't just something that happens TO us, it's also something that we CREATE with what we choose to think, believe, say &amp; do. It shows the reader that life's good 'reflections' come back to us in greater and greater abundance the more we focus on creating them. <br/><br/>I was inspired to make this book by the books that affected me most as a child. As children our books color our dreams and guide our velocities. With limited life experience as kids, these books have a huge power to shape how we perceive and interact with the world. The realization of just how much the books of my childhood molded me meant that when I had the idea for Our Mirror Book, I knew it was important enough to follow it through to its completion.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I need &amp; what you'll get...</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise $7500. This will pay for a print run of 1000 copies of Our Mirror 
Book from a local printer, and will cover shipping to my home for storage and distribution. After delivery I'll post some of the books as rewards to donors, sell them, and give them to kids 
who can't afford them.  This amount will also cover the creation of any ancillary perks claimed by contributors and the shipping of these items.<br/></p>
<p>Any extra funds I raise beyond my goal will go toward translating the book to Spanish &amp; getting it out to a wider audience. Overshooting my goal will also help build lesson plans that further the ideas contained in the book. (These will be created in conjunction with elementary-curriculum-specialists and are already in the pipeline.)</p>
<p>Speaking of rewards, we have some amazing ones on offer, including:</p>
<p> Signed copies of the book.</p>
<p>Signed Our Mirror Book wall prints.<br/></p>
<p>Original &amp; custom art pieces created
by me, including portraits of loved ones.<br/></p>
<p>Printed thank yous in the book.<br/></p>
<p>Dedication of the entire book to you, or someone you love.<br/></p>
<p>An amazing prize pack from Deepak Chopra and The Chopra Foundation.<br/></p>
<p>Signed rarity packs from The Drums and a personal video from Jonny Pierce. <br/></p>
<p>A great fan package from OK-GO.</p>
<p>An original children's song created by Paul McCartney's DJ, Chris Holmes.<br/></p>
<p>Or, if you're game, I'll even show you the studio where I created the book, cook you
dinner at my house, and then Devendra Banhart will pop by the house to sing you a
song, in person! <br/></p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>New Grit: Startups in America's Comeback Cities</i> is a story of optimism and a story of expectation. It looks at the cultural and mechanical traits that seven former industrial powerhouse cities (DET, STL, CIN, CLE, PIT, BUF, BAL) share that give them reason to be optimistic about a comeback built on the shoulders of entrepreneurship. At the same time, it lays out the steps to be taken within these cites to transform optimism into reality.<br/><br/>My name is Andy Gordon and I am the author of <i>New Grit</i>. I wrote this book because I grew up and have lived in comeback cities much of my life and find myself carrying the flag for why they're so great wherever I go. I wrote this book to help others recognize comeback cities' potential to not only regain their own prosperity of decades past, but to help propel prosperity on a regional and national scale.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a sense of hope for comeback cities and an understanding of the importance of entrepreneurship in achieving this goal. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the resurgence of once-great American cities in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand what can be done in your own community to grow its entrepreneurial spirit.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about everything from the history of small steel towns to the story of how Silicon Valley came to be. You'll hear how a bunch of cities known for awful sports teams can harness their unrelentingly rabid fandom to boost their economy. You'll hear:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Why the revival of comeback cities matters beyond each city's own borders</li>
<li>What traits make these cities uniquely equipped to ride startups to resurgence</li>
<li>How these cities can proceed to make this vision a reality</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><i>New Grit: Startups in America's Comeback Cities</i> is a non-fiction book that a variety of audiences will be fascinated by. If you are a rust belt enthusiast like myself, you will find optimism for the future of this area. If you are interested in cities, startups, or startup community development, you will find an application of many theories to specific cities given their unique traits and cultures. If you are a millennial who can’t fathom the possibility of owning a home and having a good quality of life in your current city, you will find promise in places you hadn’t considered. And finally, if you are a fan of comebacks and underdogs, or are simply wondering how a community can dig itself out of a hole, look no further.</p>
<p>Like so many of us who have committed to proving to ourselves that we can get up off the mat, these comeback cities are determined to prove their supporters right and their naysayers wrong. They are so immensely confident in the spirit and resources of their city that its resurgence is inevitable. They're not hoping for a comeback, they're waiting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Book - <i>New Grit: Startups in America's Comeback Cities</i></strong></p>The book is written in four parts....<ul>
<li>Part 1 “Comeback Cities” introduces our cities, covers the reasons why anyone should care about these cities' resurgence and why startups are a key driver, while acknowledging the reasons cities like Kansas City, Columbus, and Nashville didn't quite make the cut.</li>
<li>Part 2 “Mechanical Traits: Industry, Institutions, and Expertise” contains examples from each of the comeback cities spanning historic industry expertise to cheaper costs of doing business to the importance of existing Fortune-500 companies in places like Cincinnati.</li>
<li>Part 3 “Cultural Traits: Love, Connection, and Realism” looks at the more human side of these cities. Think things like the intense love of place you've been exposed to by any Detroiter, Buffalonian, or Yinzer talking endlessly and lovingly about their hometown. This section also looks at the historic impact of only a few industries and employers on the entrepreneurial fabric of these cities' populations.</li>
<li>Finally, Part 4 “Igniting the Comeback” lays out the keys and steps to tapping into the traits shared by come back cities.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the book's publishing costs. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2019</li>
<li>The cover design of my book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder</li>
<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy and Ebook formats)</li>
<li>The copyediting for my book - to help polish things up prior to publication</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.</p>

<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>Andy Gordon is a Buffalo native working with Techstars to develop the city's entrepreneurial ecosystem, MBA candidate at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business, assistant football coach at Gonzaga College High School in DC, dog dad to purebred mutt and March 2016 pet-of-the-month award winner at his vet Beau Gordon, damaged but persevering Bills and Sabres fan, and renowned fun uncle to nine Gordons.<br/><br/>Andy was inspired to write this book while crying into his beer after a Buffalo Bills 54-24 loss to the San Diego Chargers on the back of Nathan Peterman's five interceptions. He began anticipating the same old jabs his friends would throw at him about the lowly Bills the next day, but heard the same voice in his head that he's heard for his old life. The voice, sounding ever-haggard, insisted that every loss like this Peterman debacle would make any eventual championship all the more meaningful. This seed began to grow in the coming weeks as he dove deeper into the startups and venture capital world while at Georgetown, recognizing the overlap in these two ideas: that places that have experienced such a long string of losses not only have the most to gain in a resurgence, but have the pride and love necessary to fuel that resurgence from within.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Andy at azgordon1@gmail.com and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/azgordon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>We had great jobs and promising Silicon Valley careers. A rent controlled apartment in one of the most expensive cities in the world. A newborn daughter. And yet we walked away from it all (not the newborn).<br/><br/>In September 2018, my husband, baby, and I left our lives behind to travel the world for a year to try to reconnect with what makes each of us happy. We traveled abroad for 303 days across 11 countries and 48 cities and towns, and spent more than a year in total bouncing from hotel room to guest room to B&amp;B to Airbnb with little more than two suitcases and a travel crib. We returned to the US just in time to settle into the then-epicenter of a global pandemic, only to realize that the same lessons we learned while traveling where the ones that served us best while quarantining.<br/><br/>My name is Laura Weidman Powers and I am the author of <i>Unstuck Together: Lessons in Parenting, Partnership, and Packing from 303 Days on the Road with a Baby</i>. <i>Unstuck Together</i> is the story of three years of our lives: the year we decided to leave, the year we traveled abroad, and the year after we returned.</p>
<p>I wrote this book for the people in our lives and the people we met on our travels, the people who looked at our choices with longing, the people who looked at their lives and said “I could never...”, to show them that maybe, in fact, they could. I wrote this book for those who aren’t sure that they want starting a family to mean settling down. This book is for people who are responsible, predictable, reliable, and not spontaneous at all — because we get to have adventures, too.<br/><br/>Now that we’re all stuck navigating a global pandemic, this book has taken on new meaning. There is much that we learned about parenting and partnership while spending all our time together as a family during our year of travel that has informed how we have navigated the challenges of what will likely end up being a year or more of pandemic-induced isolation. And now that we and many of us are working completely remotely for the foreseeable future, it’s a chance to consider what it might be like to change the parts of our lives that aren’t serving us without also having to quit our jobs.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new perspective on your own life and choices, that it will inspire you to think about where you are stuck -- and where it just feels that way. After all, with work, school, exercise, socializing, and more taking place online these days, getting creative with where and how we live and build community has never been more timely.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll also learn about things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the experience of co-parenting across different cultures changed our notions of what is right for us;</li>
<li>What it's like to choose your destinations 4-5 days in advance based on your favorite foods or an obscure blog post you found; and</li>
<li>Which 12 items stayed with us through the entirety of our year of adventure.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are feeling an acute sense of wanderlust — and want to do something about it.<br/><br/><i>Unstuck Together</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to those who are both ambitious and adventurous, those who have obligations and want new opportunities, and those who are looking at uprooting their lives and creating a new normal for their families for the first time.</p>

<h3>The Book - <i>Unstuck Together</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1: The choice to leave.</strong><br/>Part 1 tells the story of how I found myself successful but stuck, pregnant, and unhappy. You’ll hear the story of the girls weekend that changed my perspective and changed my life, and how my husband and I packed up everything — including our new daughter — to make a change.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2: Our time on the road.</strong><br/>In Part 2, you’ll see us parenting across different cultures, adjusting our expectations and discovering where we hold firm. We learn how to spend tons of time together, and how important it is to spend a bit of time apart. We navigate work and leisure when lines are blurred, and try to tap into what brings each of us joy (spoiler alert: for the baby, it’s playgrounds).<br/><br/><strong>Part 3: The return.</strong><br/>Part 3 recounts how we thought we were moving to New York to be closer to family and friends, culture and community and we ended up more isolated than ever as the city became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. We drew on every hard-won insight from our time abroad to navigate our time at home as everything we determined we wanted proves to be just out of reach.</p>

We had great jobs and promising Silicon Valley careers. A rent controlled apartment in one of the most expensive cities in the world. A newborn daughter. And yet we walked away from it all (not the newborn).In September 2018, my husband, baby, and I left our lives behind to travel the world for a year to try to reconnect with what makes each of us happy. We traveled abroad for 303 days across 11 countries and 48 cities and towns, and spent more than a year in total bouncing from hotel room to guest room to B&B to Airbnb with little more than two suitcases and a travel crib. We returned to the US just in time to settle into the then-epicenter of a global pandemic, only to realize that the same lessons we learned while traveling where the ones that served us best while quarantining.My name is Laura Weidman Powers and I am the author of Unstuck Together: Lessons in Parenting, Partnership, and Packing from 303 Days on the Road with a Baby. Unstuck Together is the story of three years of our lives: the year we decided to leave, the year we traveled abroad, and the year after we returned.
I wrote this book for the people in our lives and the people we met on our travels, the people who looked at our choices with longing, the people who looked at their lives and said “I could never...”, to show them that maybe, in fact, they could. I wrote this book for those who aren’t sure that they want starting a family to mean settling down. This book is for people who are responsible, predictable, reliable, and not spontaneous at all — because we get to have adventures, too.Now that we’re all stuck navigating a global pandemic, this book has taken on new meaning. There is much that we learned about parenting and partnership while spending all our time together as a family during our year of travel that has informed how we have navigated the challenges of what will likely end up being a year or more of pandemic-induced isolation. And now that we and many of us are working completely remotely for the foreseeable future, it’s a chance to consider what it might be like to change the parts of our lives that aren’t serving us without also having to quit our jobs.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new perspective on your own life and choices, that it will inspire you to think about where you are stuck -- and where it just feels that way. After all, with work, school, exercise, socializing, and more taking place online these days, getting creative with where and how we live and build community has never been more timely.In this book, you'll also learn about things like:

How the experience of co-parenting across different cultures changed our notions of what is right for us;
What it's like to choose your destinations 4-5 days in advance based on your favorite foods or an obscure blog post you found; and
Which 12 items stayed with us through the entirety of our year of adventure.

You will love this book if you are feeling an acute sense of wanderlust — and want to do something about it.Unstuck Together is a non-fiction book that speaks to those who are both ambitious and adventurous, those who have obligations and want new opportunities, and those who are looking at uprooting their lives and creating a new normal for their families for the first time.

Anna (24), Mary (22), Helen (21), and Theresa (17) had left rural Listowel, Ireland one by one to live on “Silver Street,” the idyllic road for those who achieved the American Dream. With an unexpected violent occurrence only moments after her arrival, Bridie quickly realizes that America is not what it seems. Anna struggles with protecting and providing for her family as the matriarch. Mary desires to start her own life independent of her sisters. Helen makes several short-sighted decisions that affect more than just herself. Theresa takes on a secret new job that brings unexpected trouble. Bridie tries to grow up faster than her sisters want. Together, they learn what it means to embrace America’s fast pace and bright lights but also stay true to their Irish homeland. Follow each sister through her journey of hardship, surprise, betrayal, and success as one of America’s darkest days gets closer.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you’re a sister, have sisters, or have a mother or grandmother with sisters. The relationship between sisters is one that transcends historical time period, race, religion, economic standing, social class — any barrier or label that separates people because it is a bond anyone can relate to. You will also enjoy this book if you’re an immigrant or the descendant of an immigrant, especially one from Ireland. Like sisterhood, all immigrant experiences share common threads and the Galvin sisters’ immigrant story is no different. Finally, you’ll love this book if you enjoy the historical fiction genre, specifically the 1920s period in America.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that<i> The Galvin Girls </i>inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>Who am I as a sister? Do I support my sister(s) or those who are/have sister(s) in the best way possible?</li>
<li>Why should we rely on our families, especially our sisters, in times of struggle? How much should we rely on them?</li>
<li>How can we better aid and empower immigrant communities in the United States, not only in crisis but every single day?</li>

</ul><p> </p><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Emily Schmidt is a recent Stanford University graduate and will be pursuing a master’s degree at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication this coming autumn. She grew up celebrating her maternal Irish roots as a competitive Irish dancer with Rince Ri School of Irish Dance, even participating in the Philadelphia St. Patrick’s Day parade every March. Tracing her great-grandmother’s family back generations in Ireland on Ancestry.com during high school only intensified her love for the culture and desire to someday share her family’s story with the world.<br/><br/>While at Stanford, Emily took “Twentieth Century Irish Literature” with renowned Irish poet Eavan Boland, where she discovered her love for James Joyce’s<i> Dubliners.</i> The beginning threads of <i>The Galvin Girls</i> appeared in short stories Emily wrote for her subsequent creative writing classes. In the summers following her sophomore and junior years, she traveled to Ireland with her family to explore the places where her great-grandmother lived and meet with the daughter of the youngest Galvin sister, Josephine, who decided to stay in Ireland. It wasn’t until she sat down with Dr. Adam Johnson, her Pulitzer Prize-winning professor for “Advanced Fiction Writing,” that she pieced together the basic plot of <i>The Galvin Girls.</i><br/><br/>When she’s not writing, Emily can be found crocheting anything and everything, taking an absurd number of Buzzfeed quizzes, or re-watching Downtown Abbey for the fifth time.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Emily at emilyschmidt@emilyschmidtauthor.com  and find her on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-schmidt-author/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/emilyschmidtstanford"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/em7997/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>.</p><p> </p><h3>Questions You May Have </h3><p><strong>Q: Why did I choose New Degree Press?</strong><br/>A: If you’re unfamiliar with the publishing world, I can assure you it’s extremely difficult to break into as a young, unpublished writer. Traditional publishing has a very high rejection rate and one can spend years submitting manuscripts without any acceptances or even feedback. Self-publishing is a route that requires one to wear every hat—writer, editor, marketer, etc. It can also cost a lot of money to hire editors to ensure one’s work is up to publishing standards. I wanted to take a path down the middle with hybrid publishing, where I receive the industry expertise and structure to write the best possible book and also keep my own copyright. (Think of Jo from Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of <i>Little Women</i>.)<br/><br/><strong>Q: How much of the book is fiction?</strong><br/>A: The main characters of the book—the Galvin sisters and their love interests—were my real relatives. I based their personalities on stories I’ve heard from people who knew them. All minor characters are purely made up. Many of the places exist or once existed in Philadelphia: Broad Street Station, Wanamaker’s, Apex Hosiery, St. Columba’s, North Bonsall Street. All major historical events occurred and were highly researched to ensure an accurate depiction. Some of the events that occur to the Galvin sisters are real, but many are completely fictional or altered to fit the timeline of the plot.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Why didn’t I write a biography?</strong><br/>A: I didn’t have enough information. The children of the Galvin sisters are now in their eighties, and several of them passed away before I even conceived the idea of writing the novel. Mary’s daughter, Caye, died my junior year and Helen’s son, my grandfather, passed last October. And even then, they had a limited number of stories to share because they’re older and don’t remember everything. I have historical records from Ancestry.com, albums of old photographs, and my own experience visiting where they grew up in Ireland, but beyond that, there’s not enough information to write a biography.<br/><br/><strong>Q: What would the real Galvin sisters think of this book?</strong><br/>A: When I interviewed Mary’s daughter, Caye, she told me that the Galvin sisters deserved to be known. She always thought someone would write a book about them. For whatever reason, the universe has dropped that task in my lap and I’m doing my absolute best to honor authentically through my art. I believe they would smile, laugh, and want to share it with others. And in the words of my great-grandmother Helen, she’d say, “Ooooo Em-ly.”<br/><br/><strong>Q: Am I going to write more books in the future?</strong><br/>A: Absolutely! I hope publishing <i>The Galvin Girls</i> will give me the experience and credibility to get my own literary agent. Writing a novel the second time around should (hopefully!) be much easier than the first. I do have some ideas in the back of my brain pleading to be explored, but for now, revising and editing<i> The Galvin Girls</i> is my primary task until at least mid-October.<br/><br/><strong>Q: How can I be going to journalism school and writing a novel? Don’t they conflict with one another?</strong><br/>A: The beauty about being a writer is that I don’t need to define myself one way or another. I’ve written poetry, short stories, articles, personal essays, and now a novel. I might end up working for a newspaper or magazine, but that doesn’t take away from my imagination. I’m just practicing and perfecting different sets of writing skills. Kurt Vonnegut was a journalist for <i>Sports Illustrated</i> at one point!</p><p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

 About the AuthorEmily Schmidt is a recent Stanford University graduate and will be pursuing a master’s degree at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication this coming autumn. She grew up celebrating her maternal Irish roots as a competitive Irish dancer with Rince Ri School of Irish Dance, even participating in the Philadelphia St. Patrick’s Day parade every March. Tracing her great-grandmother’s family back generations in Ireland on Ancestry.com during high school only intensified her love for the culture and desire to someday share her family’s story with the world.While at Stanford, Emily took “Twentieth Century Irish Literature” with renowned Irish poet Eavan Boland, where she discovered her love for James Joyce’s Dubliners. The beginning threads of The Galvin Girls appeared in short stories Emily wrote for her subsequent creative writing classes. In the summers following her sophomore and junior years, she traveled to Ireland with her family to explore the places where her great-grandmother lived and meet with the daughter of the youngest Galvin sister, Josephine, who decided to stay in Ireland. It wasn’t until she sat down with Dr. Adam Johnson, her Pulitzer Prize-winning professor for “Advanced Fiction Writing,” that she pieced together the basic plot of The Galvin Girls.When she’s not writing, Emily can be found crocheting anything and everything, taking an absurd number of Buzzfeed quizzes, or re-watching Downtown Abbey for the fifth time.For more information you can connect with Emily at emilyschmidt@emilyschmidtauthor.com  and find her on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram. Questions You May Have Q: Why did I choose New Degree Press?A: If you’re unfamiliar with the publishing world, I can assure you it’s extremely difficult to break into as a young, unpublished writer. Traditional publishing has a very high rejection rate and one can spend years submitting manuscripts without any acceptances or even feedback. Self-publishing is a route that requires one to wear every hat—writer, editor, marketer, etc. It can also cost a lot of money to hire editors to ensure one’s work is up to publishing standards. I wanted to take a path down the middle with hybrid publishing, where I receive the industry expertise and structure to write the best possible book and also keep my own copyright. (Think of Jo from Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Little Women.)Q: How much of the book is fiction?A: The main characters of the book—the Galvin sisters and their love interests—were my real relatives. I based their personalities on stories I’ve heard from people who knew them. All minor characters are purely made up. Many of the places exist or once existed in Philadelphia: Broad Street Station, Wanamaker’s, Apex Hosiery, St. Columba’s, North Bonsall Street. All major historical events occurred and were highly researched to ensure an accurate depiction. Some of the events that occur to the Galvin sisters are real, but many are completely fictional or altered to fit the timeline of the plot.Q: Why didn’t I write a biography?A: I didn’t have enough information. The children of the Galvin sisters are now in their eighties, and several of them passed away before I even conceived the idea of writing the novel. Mary’s daughter, Caye, died my junior year and Helen’s son, my grandfather, passed last October. And even then, they had a limited number of stories to share because they’re older and don’t remember everything. I have historical records from Ancestry.com, albums of old photographs, and my own experience visiting where they grew up in Ireland, but beyond that, there’s not enough information to write a biography.Q: What would the real Galvin sisters think of this book?A: When I interviewed Mary’s daughter, Caye, she told me that the Galvin sisters deserved to be known. She always thought someone would write a book about them. For whatever reason, the universe has dropped that task in my lap and I’m doing my absolute best to honor authentically through my art. I believe they would smile, laugh, and want to share it with others. And in the words of my great-grandmother Helen, she’d say, “Ooooo Em-ly.”Q: Am I going to write more books in the future?A: Absolutely! I hope publishing The Galvin Girls will give me the experience and credibility to get my own literary agent. Writing a novel the second time around should (hopefully!) be much easier than the first. I do have some ideas in the back of my brain pleading to be explored, but for now, revising and editing The Galvin Girls is my primary task until at least mid-October.Q: How can I be going to journalism school and writing a novel? Don’t they conflict with one another?A: The beauty about being a writer is that I don’t need to define myself one way or another. I’ve written poetry, short stories, articles, personal essays, and now a novel. I might end up working for a newspaper or magazine, but that doesn’t take away from my imagination. I’m just practicing and perfecting different sets of writing skills. Kurt Vonnegut was a journalist for Sports Illustrated at one point! Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

<h2 style=""text-align: left;"">Story of My Book</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><i>Reins Pulling Bronco</i> is about a child of the new world order who yearns for independence in a society ruled by a golden generation, blatantly consuming the working class for the benefit of their daily operations. With the birth of her unrelated brother and recent disappearance of lead ranchers, Bronco must decide whether to put her life on hold for the sake of Bronco Ranch or live out her dreams traveling beyond the terrains and control of Ultreu.<br/><br/>My name is Kyle Bardell and I am the author of <i>Reins Pulling Bronco</i>. I wrote this book to achieve a childhood dream of writing my own novel as well as exploring the lessons of the world through my own eyes. My hope is to provide a shining light to the lost Black Youth of today, in hopes for a better future tomorrow. <br/><br/>In reading this book, one will relate the choices of the characters to a decision they made in their own life. I want this book to open one’s eyes to the beauty and darkness we can find within ourselves. Listen to each character as they all follow their own individual paths as if they each have a lesson to teach. Containing a wide range of characters, one should be able to relate-- no matter the reader’s perspective.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/>A select few perceived to be the source of prosperity spent their lives to build a home for the future generations to flourish. With efforts to sustain their exponential growth, this “golden generation“ gave each basic resource— wood, ore, agriculture, and livestock— a separate territory in order to complete the construction of the new capital Ultreu. Learning from their mistakes at the unfinished Tower of Prestinia, Ultreu devised a system of diplomacy eliminating differences in education and social standing for the benefit of the society and to repair the changes in the climate caused by the tower’s construction. While resource allocation solely depends on a unit’s dependency to the capital, the capital’s only job is to distribute resources.<br/><br/>The changing of seasons bring out the Ice-Walkers— or as Bronco describes them, Blockheads. Their skin is pale-blue like the ice blocks encapsulating whatever lies atop their shoulders. Traveling in packs, these human-like creatures migrate with the moving winter storm— a never ending blizzard that travels around the island of Alprova. Jericho, a lead rancher of Bronco’s unit, informed Bronco to pay the monsters no mind and let them wander through the snow. Their origin is unknown and their existence is little acknowledged by most, until the lights of Prestinia’s Tower begin to glow.</p>
</div>
<br/>You will love this book if you enjoy adventure, philosophy, and allegorical storytelling.<br/><br/><i>Reins Pulling Bronco</i> speaks to the Black Youth, particularly those who are considered losted in today's world.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Reins Pulling Bronco inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging topics like:<ul>
<li>The impact on our surrounding environment</li>
<li>The need for order in our lives.</li>
<li>The value of our generational traumas</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing generational knowledge, narcissism, and self-discovery will change us all for the better.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Book's Artistic Approach, Mission, and Vision</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The world has grown in technology, knowledge, and acceptance. The specific teachings of past generations do not pertain to today's world; however, the basic core of the knowledge is still valuable. Sifting through wisdom of my own as well as those interviewed, I wanted to find multiple answers to a single question: ""what is something I know now about the world I wish I had known then, that is different--in perspective--from my parents?""</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A collective worry I see in my community is the loss of the Black youth-- specifically, the lost in drive and life's purpose. To become lost, one must first be lead astray. When someone becomes lost, the person does not immediately realize it. The individual first experiences an invalidation in their life and begins to look for guidance. Seeking answers, the recently lost is told a reality from another person who possesses unaware traumas and invalidations, breeding a spiral in the new lost soul. Once the new lost soul becomes validated by whatever mindset they have endorsed, one is then troubled with the challenge of changing the accepted perspective. Those lost can only help themselves, because we control our own reality. Attempting to disrupt the spiraling of newly lost souls will result in a cycle of codependency-- where one becomes susceptible to the same fate. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Instead of forcing blinders onto the youth, as did past generations trying to block the evils out of our worlds, I want to educate and provide a guiding light by using allegorical lives of fictional Black characters. My vision is to have the novel in school systems with high Black/ African-American drop-out rates. The book was written with a young Black girl protagonist, because of the underrepresentation of Black women in fictional novels. I also paid close mind to the portrayal of Black men and how I believe masculinity to be projected today. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In reading this novel, one will see how it looks to be lost from an outside perspective and how the reactions of those recently lost can impact their immediate surroundings.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Exceptionally Average: Through Their Eyes</i> is exploring how today's most exceptional young professionals discover how to serve others and unlock their potential.<br/><br/>My name is Tian Shi and I am the author of <i>Exceptionally Average: Through Their Eyes</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore how founders used social entrepreneurship to build fulfilling careers to guide my own soul-searching process. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be inspired. I want to show you that anyone can cause a ripple of change within their own community. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for entrepreneurship. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you discover your own potential by creating your own path and remaining steadfast to your core values and beliefs.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about what it means to be a servant leader and how to leverage your assets and passions to positively benefit your community. You'll hear stories from...</p>
<ul>
<li>Eric Woods, who left Wall Street to pursue a career in entrepreneurship to benefit his local home community with services that were not present previously.</li>
<li>Adele McClure, who was told at a young age she couldn’t attend her dream college because she did not have the academic prowess, set out to change her state’s legislature to empower minority communities from which she came from.</li>
<li>Yossuf Albanawi, who used his personal struggles to found a company to prevent the opioid epidemic across the United States.</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you want to learn how others achieved their vocational goals, want to explore what the entrepreneurship industry has to offer, or are just searching for a career that truly fulfills your passion.<br/><br/><i>Exceptionally Average: Through Their Eyes</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to college students and young professionals who want to look at how to manifest their ideas into a reality and want to embark on their career in a non-traditional way.<br/> <h2>The Book - <i>Exceptionally Average: Through Their Eyes</i>
</h2>
<br/>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. We’ll learn why serving others is so powerful and ever so important in this day and age where we are all so individually focused. Why is it that if you find a $20 bill, you’ll find more fulfillment spending it on someone else than yourself? And yet, with the rise of social media and individualism, we as a society are becoming more divided and less united. How far will a single act of kindness take you?<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-10. We will learn the seven pillars of servant leadership through stories from seventeen entrepreneurs and their lived experiences. Explore how you can create generational wealth through Jervonte’s Edmonds story and how to tackle ingrained social inequalities from Joy Buolamwini’s experience.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 11-14. We’ll learn how to become a servant leader from nine entrepreneurs. These four chapters investigate how to cultivate leadership in high school, college, as a recent graduate, and how to leverage the support from your immediate network to aid your own journey as an entrepreneur. Hear about Shaun Johnson’s two-decade-long journey to discover his entrepreneurial traits and how others, like Khuram Zuman, discovered his innovative nature at a young age. <br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>

</ul> <h2>About the Author</h2>
<strong>Tian Shi </strong>is a student at Georgetown University, studying Biology, Cognitive Science, and Entrepreneurship. She is a mentor, teacher, and intern for a biotechnological startup.<br/><br/>She wrote this book because she wanted to explore how to embark on the non-traditional career path of becoming an entrepreneur to better others. She is curious to explore careers outside of the corporate, 9-5 lifestyle after she graduates college. She took it upon herself to understand the world of innovation in order to make a name for herself and inspire others to do the same.<br/><br/>In her spare time, she likes to explore the city that she’s living in by going for long runs. She likes to cook—pesto pizza with mozzarella is her favorite—paint, draw, and listen to podcasts that she comes across on Spotify, like Daily Ted Talks and Michelle Obama’s podcast.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Tian at ttshi123@gmail.com and at @nait.shi on Instagram.<br/> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

I wrote this book because I wanted to explore how founders used social entrepreneurship to build fulfilling careers to guide my own soul-searching process. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be inspired. I want to show you that anyone can cause a ripple of change within their own community. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for entrepreneurship. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you discover your own potential by creating your own path and remaining steadfast to your core values and beliefs.In this book, you'll learn about what it means to be a servant leader and how to leverage your assets and passions to positively benefit your community. You'll hear stories from...

Eric Woods, who left Wall Street to pursue a career in entrepreneurship to benefit his local home community with services that were not present previously.
Adele McClure, who was told at a young age she couldn’t attend her dream college because she did not have the academic prowess, set out to change her state’s legislature to empower minority communities from which she came from.
Yossuf Albanawi, who used his personal struggles to found a company to prevent the opioid epidemic across the United States.
You will love this book if you want to learn how others achieved their vocational goals, want to explore what the entrepreneurship industry has to offer, or are just searching for a career that truly fulfills your passion.Exceptionally Average: Through Their Eyes is a nonfiction book that speaks to college students and young professionals who want to look at how to manifest their ideas into a reality and want to embark on their career in a non-traditional way. The Book - Exceptionally Average: Through Their Eyes

The book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. We’ll learn why serving others is so powerful and ever so important in this day and age where we are all so individually focused. Why is it that if you find a $20 bill, you’ll find more fulfillment spending it on someone else than yourself? And yet, with the rise of social media and individualism, we as a society are becoming more divided and less united. How far will a single act of kindness take you?Part 2 contains chapters 4-10. We will learn the seven pillars of servant leadership through stories from seventeen entrepreneurs and their lived experiences. Explore how you can create generational wealth through Jervonte’s Edmonds story and how to tackle ingrained social inequalities from Joy Buolamwini’s experience.Part 3 contains chapters 11-14. We’ll learn how to become a servant leader from nine entrepreneurs. These four chapters investigate how to cultivate leadership in high school, college, as a recent graduate, and how to leverage the support from your immediate network to aid your own journey as an entrepreneur. Hear about Shaun Johnson’s two-decade-long journey to discover his entrepreneurial traits and how others, like Khuram Zuman, discovered his innovative nature at a young age.  What I Need & What You'll Get

I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use.
