We want to save your air AND your precious space. 
* The following screen is optimized for desktop.
 
           We wanted to change the mechanical appearance of air purifiers. To overcome this artificiality, we studied the opposite: designs that look natural and focus on the essence of what the product does.Since air purifiers tend to stay in one place, they should blend into their surroundings.Nature is the world’s air purifier, so natural, Scandinavian design was our biggest inspiration.      In 2018, we started collecting images and words from our two sources (nature and Scandinavian design) to sketch our plans.Luckily, we met a young design team in Denmark, and our global project was born.Finally, we hit upon the perfect design that combines our nature-inspired shape with the Scandinavian style……and we named it Löv.      To analyze how consumers use air purifiers in their real life and which functions they need the most, we visited numerous furniture and interior design showrooms, exhibitions, and consumers’ houses. So, we thought it would be great if an air purifier could be adjusted to suit different spaces and situations while, of course, maintaining its beauty as well.   With a one-touch cradle dis/assembly, you can change your Löv to be positioned any way you want.  Whether you change your furniture, room, house—or even just your mood—Löv is there to match your needs.     This problem is not yours alone. That’s why we made Löv: to bring freedom to your precious space.""Slim"" means something more special.Löv helps you to save space for things that are valuable to you, like another plant in your small apartment or maybe some more toys in the children's room.       We rearranged the inlet, fan, and outlet to enable the slim profile. Then, we patented Löv technology, which combines high performance with a narrow profile.    To develop this innovative FAN blade, we went through countless CFD [Computational Fluid Dynamics], including Flow simulations of Solidworks and ANSYS Fluent program, to make it withstand the pressure of the filter within the set width and noise limit.   The Central Air Guide, which also got a patent, reduces the pressure drop of the airflow coming out from several fans, which provides soft and wide air and eventually cuts the noise as well. By making samples with a 3D printer and CNC machine and testing them, we determined the optimal structure for the air guide.         This compact body shoots out about 25 single cubic meter boxes of clean air in just 10 minutes.*This is an estimated performance, which is planned for KS official standard test.    We removed all the distracting functions, so we can focus more on the things that matter most.  Fine dust concentration is displayed in both numbers and 4 different levels of colors. This Auto Mode helps you to check how well the air purifier is working without needing an extra device.When the device is used horizontally, the display changes to be horizontal as well.  According to the graph above, Löv’s laser dust sensor produces exactly the same air measurement value as other professional dust measuring devices. These devices are normally more than $100, making Löv both beautiful and economical.            Komma is the same word as “Comma” in Nordic countries.

It's the perfect addition to your inner garden houseplants: its lively personality makes it the ideal plant companion. Stretch Goals:

€50k ✓ =  Water reservoir sub-irrigation system. It means less frequent watering and your plant receives all the water it needs automatically. When Lua is thirsty = reservoir is empty; Lua is sick = reservoir is full.

€100k ✓ = Standard QI wireless power transfer
You will be able to choose your color after the end of the campaign.  Lua saves your greenery and makes you skip the hassle of an intricate setup: the free mobile app only requires an internet connection once for the download, and is then operational, even offline! Using Lua’s app is literally as simple as scanning a QR code!Lua displays 15 different real-time animations: 6 animations are directly related to your plant’s health and overall well-being, while the 9 others give Lua and your plant, a spark of life. 6 essential animations: Thirsty: When soil moisture drops under the defined threshold, you need to water your plant. Sick: Too much water can kill your plant too, wait until Lua is thirsty to add water. Vampire: After a few days Lua will turn into a vampire if exposure to light is not sufficient. Squint: Too much exposure to light can harm your plant, when Lua is squinting it’s looking for shade. Cold: When the temperature drops. Lua will sneeze the day after. Hot: Lua is too hot.Other animations: Happy: Lua is back to normal. Puzzled: Lua couldn’t read your QR code. Wink: You showed a QR code to Lua and it understood it. Tired: Lua will go back to sleep when there’s no movement in front of it. Wake-up: When Lua senses a movement. Grumpy: Random animation. If stretch goal #2 is reached, Lua will look grumpy when there’s a good chance of rain. Tongue sticking out: Random animation. Motion tracking feature:Lua detects a movement and follows it with the eyes. If nothing happens, Lua will go back to sleep.  The app has been entirely designed around simplicity and ease-of-use:

Download Lua app & let the easy setup install it in less than no time.

Choose your plant’s family, the exact type of plant or manually set your own preferred thresholds. 

Make Lua read the generated QR code and it’s all set!
 The app lets you browse your plant’s category and type, then generates a QR code holding info specific to your plant. Lua reads the QR code generated on your device’s screen and sets the parameters.The app allows you to change Lua’s facial proportions and automatically adapts the animations accordingly. The motion sensor allows Lua’s eyes to follow the movement in front of them: it’s like Lua’s looking at you!    - The planter comes with a sub-irrigation water reservoir.

Now, we’re back to prove that “good” doesn’t have to be good enough. Amid rapid company growth, we’ve spent countless hours devising a way to do more than just elevate the way you cook. We want to transform it entirely.​


This time around, our goal is to offer you a cookware series that not only looks and cooks like a premium product line, but also features the most groundbreaking non-stick technology to date...all that with the direct-to-consumer prices our supporters have come to expect.

One of the most appealing aspects of modern cookware—and also one of their greatest failings—is the non-stick coating. We wanted to do something truly unprecedented, which is why we spent the past two years searching for technology that could match our lofty standards and take the Masters Collection into entirely new territory.

Our newest cookware series features the most durable and effective non-stick coating ever created, with genuinely remarkable scratch and wear resistance. The coating was initially developed to protect critical parts in medical, automotive, and aerospace tools and engines—and now, we’ve applied it to our cookware to incredible effect.
 


Coin scratch resistance test results. Under normal temperature, using coating scratch resistance tester, with 3Kg vertical pressure to test the coating damage caused by the coin with 10cm moving distance. Back and forth as a cycle.

As the molecules set, they interlock to form a robust, dimpled cooking surface that’s been proven to outlast anything else on the market. (We think the texture resembles the rind of a lemon or lime.)

Embrace Your Plastic. 
Made from recycled plastics, and with removable heads: Doop is the last toothbrush you'll ever buy. 
 

 
One Billion toothbrushes are thrown away just in the United States, every year! Be part of the solution. Join the Doop movement.
 

 
When we began to analyze the sustainability market we were on a mission to create a positive change in our daily behaviours. We paid particular attention to the dramatic amount of plastic that's thrown away each day and doing harm to our planet.
So we asked, what if we embraced our plastic? What if we could transform it into a recycled and recyclable material that everyone can use on a daily basis? This is where the idea for Doop started.
 

 


 

 
 
Plastic reengineered
With the help of academics and scientists, we have designed a conscious toothbrush that directly tackles the problem of plastic pollution by giving it a new life.
 

 
 
Why buy a toothbrush knowing it will one day end up in a landfill? Say no to single-use plastic, and say yes to Doop.
According to our peer-reviewed Lifecycle report, switching to Doop will result in a 66% reduction in ecotoxicity when compared to a traditional toothbrush. 
 

 
 
The click
When you're ready to replace your toothbrush head or want to wash it, you can easily snap off the old one and snap a new one on. You'll never have to replace the toothbrush body.

 

 
 
Free shipping worldwide
You can buy our toothbrushes from anywhere in the world and we'll ship them to you in our sleek packaging... absolutely free.
 

 


 
 

 
 

 
Doop was specially created with the environment in mind.
The graphics above and below show the environmental impact of Doop when compared to a traditional toothbrush.
 


 
Doop toothbrushes are made from recycled polypropylene, and the bristles are nylon. 
 

 


 

 
The data on the chart above is from our own internally commissioned, and peer reviewed report.  And we are happy to supply anyone a copy upon request.
 

 
Doop is innovative in terms of a systems’ thinking approach, leveraging the benefits of material selection, eco-design, and local production in order to improve the local economies.
Also, our return system after end-of-life promotes a circular economic solution, and transparent communication by measuring all the environmental impacts on the system. By introducing these types of products, and systems into the market, we will be demonstrating their true potential.

<p>After two years of making an extensive research to find the best quality on materials and technology for our cookware, we finally found the perfect recipe to produce our pans and pots series. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500891768/dpwafij6g8qoutrx3egk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All our Frying Pans and Pots are made with a <strong>Die Cast Aluminium Body</strong>. This is our special aluminium alloy and thanks to its high quality, it is extremely resistant to impacts and cannot be deformed. This assures a long lasting family of products.</p>
<p>Our special Aluminium Alloy contains <strong>high conductivity</strong>, allowing the heat to spread evenly throughout the entire surface. This upgrades the cooking experience to a much higher level while giving you more control over your food.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500893230/d3qhsyrvumj9zyqo71eg.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>For our coating, we teamed up with the top quality <strong>Swiss brand ILAG</strong>, offering the highest quality of nonstick coating. We have chosen the Granitec technology for each of our pans and pots. This consists in a<strong> five-layer nonstick coating, reinforced by ceramic scratch proof particles</strong> that are able to endure any intense use. Because of its multi- layered system and the ceramic reinforcement, we guarantee a long lifetime and the best abrasion and corrosion resistance.</p>
<p>In addition to its excellent performance characteristics, the coating is also <strong>healthy and environmental friendly</strong>. All our products are 100% PFOA free for a safe food consumption.</p>

<p>In order to make our non-stick property so long lasting, we tested our prototypes continuously over a certain period of time. All our non-stick tests were combined with mechanical and chemical abuse to simulate a typical long-term household use and test if the most common cooking ingredients will stick over time.</p>

<p>It is very common to use extremely corrosive ingredients such as tomatoes, salt, vinegar and different spices. Some recipes require long cooking hours within high temperatures. Combining this process along with corrosive ingredients damages average coatings. We tested Granitec in terms of resistance to blistering, undermining, staining and other defects.</p>

<p>Abrasion resistance refers to the capability of coatings to withstand superficial rubbing and scratching without being worn away.

<p><strong>LGA Abrasion Test: </strong>This test uses a special mixture of steel balls and water, a mixture which heavily abuses the coating. These items are then positioned onto an orbital shaking machine at a speed of 300 rpm for 15, 30 and 45 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>MTP Abrasion Test: </strong>The test uses a special rotating “head” to which three ballpoint pen refills are attached under a specific load. The items are positioned on a hotplate and brought up to a temperature of 200°C while the hotplate is moving back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>British Standard Abrasion Test:</strong> This test uses a specified Scotch-Brite pad, which is rubbed back and forth on the coating and combined with water and detergent. The test tries to simulate the cleaning and scrubbing action on cook- and bakeware.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Abrasion Test: </strong>This test uses an abrasive pad that rotates on the coating under a certain load and a certain speed.

<p>We are three Italians. This means we were wired to feel passionate for food! We love cooking, but every time we wanted to get new cookware, we felt it was <strong>impossible to find good products at reasonable prices.</strong>    </p>
<p>Does it really have to be this expensive to be a home cook passionate? We refused to accept this fact as a reality.  </p>
<p>What if passionate cooks didn’t have to buy expensive brands in order to get high quality products? And so, our journey began as we set up our own mission to <strong>offer honesty amongst everything.</strong>  </p>
<p>We believe in making business by focusing on the quality of our products rather than the profit. For us, <strong>offering high quality at a fair price</strong> means also setting an example and inspiring other business to run with transparency by all means.</p>
</div></div>","After two years of making an extensive research to find the best quality on materials and technology for our cookware, we finally found the perfect recipe to produce our pans and pots series. 

All our Frying Pans and Pots are made with a Die Cast Aluminium Body. This is our special aluminium alloy and thanks to its high quality, it is extremely resistant to impacts and cannot be deformed. This assures a long lasting family of products.
Our special Aluminium Alloy contains high conductivity, allowing the heat to spread evenly throughout the entire surface. This upgrades the cooking experience to a much higher level while giving you more control over your food.


For our coating, we teamed up with the top quality Swiss brand ILAG, offering the highest quality of nonstick coating. We have chosen the Granitec technology for each of our pans and pots. This consists in a five-layer nonstick coating, reinforced by ceramic scratch proof particles that are able to endure any intense use. Because of its multi- layered system and the ceramic reinforcement, we guarantee a long lifetime and the best abrasion and corrosion resistance.
In addition to its excellent performance characteristics, the coating is also healthy and environmental friendly. All our products are 100% PFOA free for a safe food consumption.



Coupled with our high quality Aluminium Body, we added a special and thick reinforced stainless steel bottom. This will grant a faster heat distribution, allowing these products to cook greatly with gas, ceramic, induction, electric or any other cooking technology.



In order to make our non-stick property so long lasting, we tested our prototypes continuously over a certain period of time. All our non-stick tests were combined with mechanical and chemical abuse to simulate a typical long-term household use and test if the most common cooking ingredients will stick over time.


It is very common to use extremely corrosive ingredients such as tomatoes, salt, vinegar and different spices. Some recipes require long cooking hours within high temperatures. Combining this process along with corrosive ingredients damages average coatings. We tested Granitec in terms of resistance to blistering, undermining, staining and other defects.


Abrasion resistance refers to the capability of coatings to withstand superficial rubbing and scratching without being worn away. Thanks to reinforcing additives and the special ceramic particles, Granitec showed a considerably higher quality surface hardness and wear resistance than any other average coatings. 

LGA Abrasion Test: This test uses a special mixture of steel balls and water, a mixture which heavily abuses the coating. These items are then positioned onto an orbital shaking machine at a speed of 300 rpm for 15, 30 and 45 minutes.
MTP Abrasion Test: The test uses a special rotating “head” to which three ballpoint pen refills are attached under a specific load. The items are positioned on a hotplate and brought up to a temperature of 200°C while the hotplate is moving back and forth.
British Standard Abrasion Test: This test uses a specified Scotch-Brite pad, which is rubbed back and forth on the coating and combined with water and detergent. The test tries to simulate the cleaning and scrubbing action on cook- and bakeware.
Dry Abrasion Test: This test uses an abrasive pad that rotates on the coating under a certain load and a certain speed. The number of rotations carried out to expose the substrate is an indication of lifetime expectation

Comfortable, safe, easy to use and adaptable to any situation! We assure you that after trying our family of pots, you will run out recipes to keep the fun going.

For us, comfort comes always first. This is why we have included these silicone handle holders for the best grip. Our goal is to simplify your life as much as possible so we made them detachable to make cleaning easier.

In addition, we have designed an innovative lid that suits and adapts to all your daily cooking needs. This lid includes two different strainers for water draining and steam release. You can choose between a fast or a slower draining speed for the perfect dosage. The lid rim is made of silicone in order to achieve the best grip when pouring.

We like to think of every single cooking detail, this is why we thought about those annoying moments where you are cooking in a rush, but can’t find a spot for your spoon, so you end up dripping everywhere. Well, our lid contains a perfect silicone spoon holder that will save your counter from all those messy stains.

<p><strong>What does the Rocean One offer that I can't get from my standard pitcher filter?</strong></p>
<p>The Rocean One is the first smart water device built for both homes and commercial environments to filter, flavor and carbonate your water. Our goal is to provide you with the same convenience and breadth of beverage choices that what you've come to expect from the local supermarket - without the plastic and at a fraction of the carbon footprint.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I drink bottled water because I don't trust the filtration of tap water. How do I know that the water that comes from Rocean One is just as pure - or purer - than bottled water?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to water purity, the bottled water industry is actually less regulated than the water that comes from our tap. This means that even after spending money on bottled water and generating a significant carbon footprint, you may still be drinking water that contains contaminants and microplastics. Our carbon block filtration system is 15x more powerful and removes 75 more contaminants than a standard pitcher filter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When it comes to enhanced water, I'm very particular about the level of flavoring and the amount of carbonation. That's why I have my preferred water brands. How would the Rocean One replicate my same preferred taste?</strong></p>
<p>Our team of engineers have spent over 2 years developing our ""Precise Personalization"" system that allows you to re-create your favorite beverages or create something entirely new. Our RFID-enabled pod technology allows you to select your preferred level of carbonation and flavoring. And through our branded pod partnerships, you can re-create your favorite flavored water beverages (that you're currently drinking from a plastic bottle.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How long does it take to install?</strong></p>
<p>With our remote reservoir system, you can start using your Rocean One immediately or you can have a professional spend 15 minutes connecting it to the cold water supply line under the sink. Either way, it’s incredibly easy to start using your Rocean.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How much space will Rocean occupy on my countertop?</strong></p>
<p>We designed rocean to fit perfectly under your cabinet and occupy half the counter space of a standard toaster oven. The size varies depending on whether you opt for the remote reservoir or the plumbed-in option, and measures approximately 15"" tall, 16"" long and 5"" deep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do I need to purchase a specific bottle to use with my Rocean?</strong></p>
<p>No. The Rocean One is designed to be used with any bottle or even a single glass. You do not need to purchase any specific bottles to properly use the device.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What bottle sizes can the Rocean One accommodate?</strong></p>
<p>The bottle area on the Rocean One is approximately 12 inches tall and 5 inches wide, meaning it can accommodate almost any bottle size or even a single glass. Our touch-screen dispenser means that you can fill your carafe, water bottle or even a small sip of your preferred water beverage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How many drinks can I make with one flavor pod?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your preferred amount of flavoring, 2 flavor pods can make 48 bottles of flavored water at approximately 1/5th the cost.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How much sparkling water does one CO2 canister yield?</strong></p>
<p>1 CO2 canister can make up to 30 17oz bottles of sparkling water at approximately 1/3rd the cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How often do I need to replace the filter?</strong></p>
<p>Most households will only need to replace their filter once a year. As a smart device, your Rocean One will keep track of your filter usage and remind you as it's time to re-order a new filter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is the water refrigerated?</strong></p>
<p>To minimize Rocean’s footprint on your kitchen counter - and the environment - we left out refrigeration. The typical temperature of the water coming from your city’s underground pipes is 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Since the Rocean One quickly refills large pitchers and carafes, it’s easy to keep your fridge stocked with your favorite drinks at the temperature you want.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What type of water filtration does Rocean use?</strong></p>
<p>Rocean uses carbon block filtration technology that is certified by the National Science Foundation to effectively filter over 75 contaminants from drinking water. That's 15x more effective than pitcher filters. Plus, you can filter up to 300 gallons of water before you need to replace it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What makes carbon block filtration so effective?</strong></p>
<p>Carbon block filters are smaller, faster, and more efficient than alternate filtration methods, such as reverse osmosis and distillation. Reverse osmosis wastes 4 liters of water per 1 liter of potable water produced, and it requires a large 3' x 2' feet under-the-counter system. Meanwhile, distillation can take 2 hours to produce a single liter of water, and uses as much energy as an air conditioning unit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Does the Rocean filter remove microplastics?</strong></p>
<p>Our submicron water filter traps particles smaller than a single micron in size, meaning that it has no problem filtering microplastics, including synthetic fibers which have a diameter of 10 microns in size. Microplastics are not visible to the naked eye, but have been found in 94% of US tap water samples, and are becoming an increasingly large cause of concern to the scientific community, although their impact on human health has not yet been fully assessed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Does the Rocean filter remove flouride?</strong></p>
<p>Our advanced submicron carbon block filter has been rigorously engineered and re-engineered to effectively reduce upwards of 99% of a multitude of contaminants, including the most dangerous such as asbestos, cysts, industrial chemicals, heavy metals like lead and mercury, and microplastics. It does not, however, significantly reduce fluoride which, in tap water in the US is typically below 0.7 ppm (well below any known risk levels) Here's a full list of contaminants our filter removes from drinking water: <a href=""http://bit.ly/r0contaminants"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bit.ly/r0contaminants</a></p>

<h1>Working Prototypes</h1>
<p>During our two year development of Kapsul, we extensively modeled thermal performance to achieve the smallest possible form factor.  After building many small-scale heat exchanger prototypes to check our math, we built a fully functioning air conditioner using custom components made to our specifications.  </p>
<p>Currently, we have designed and built two full-scale prototypes.  One is a thermal prototype which actually works to pump heat at the size we have designed, and a user experience prototype which acts as a testbed for us to work on the installation experience, confirm the function of our light pipe and knob design, and continue to develop the iOS and Android apps to confirm software/hardware integration.</p>

<p>Kapsul has been in development for over two years, and in that time our team of experienced engineers and designers have addressed all the major technical hurdles associated with this product. After many prototypes and much analysis, Kapsul is ready to begin the road to production.</p>
<p>Kapsul worked with the team at <a href=""http://www.likuma.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Likuma Labs</a>, an established product development firm that has experience bringing projects from the drawing board to the production line in various industries including consumer products, medical devices, and industrial automation. We know what it takes to bring hardware into production, and we know there will be challenges along the way.</p>
<p>No product development process is free from hiccups, and that's why we live by the mantra to ""prototype early and often."" We've budgeted a year to bring Kapsul into production and into your hands well before the Summer of 2017. We know this is a long time to wait, but Kapsul is a complex device with electronics and mechanical systems, and it must communicate with two separate apps (iOS and Android). Rather than rush to put out a buggy, 0th-generation product, we want our backers to have the user experience they deserve on the first day they open the box.</p>
<p>In the Summer of 2016 we plan to extensively test numerous pre-production units here in our own Philadelphia homes to work out all the bugs and kinks in the design and user interface so that we can move into full production knowing the design is ready for you. We've budgeted extra production time in case the first production units don't meet our exacting requirements. During the production roll-out, some specifications presented above may change slightly, such as precise dimensions and energy data. However, we believe the numbers presented to be a realistic outcome, and are not just optimistic estimates.</p>
<p>There is a risk that Kapsul will not be ready to ship in time for Spring of 2017. Given the seasonal nature of the product, a 3-6 month slip in timeline would result in Kapsul being delivered during or after the Summer of 2017. We know that backers would be incredibly disappointed in this result, and we are working late nights and weekends to minimize this risk. However, given the complexity of the supply chain management, regulatory requirements, and third-party safety verification required, backers should understand there is a risk the shipment timeline could slip into or beyond the Summer of 2017.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kurt/noria-cool-redefined/description#project_faq_169581"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Can Kapsul be placed vertically in a window?</a></p>
<p><b>Kapsul is currently designed to only be placed horizontally.</b> There are a number of engineering issues that must be addressed before Kapsul could be placed vertically, including compressor lubrication and condensate dripping. However, given the feedback from many interested parties, we are exploring incorporating this into the design as we move forward with production. However, potential backers should note that we cannot commit to accommodating a vertical installation at this time.</p>

Features


Specifications   
Cooling Type: Vapor-compression refrigeration using environmentally and ozone-friendly R410a refrigerant.
Cooling Capacity: 5,000 BTU/hour.
Room size: Up to 160 square feet.
Window Opening Size: 21"" to 36"" wide.
Window Type: Single or double-hung window frames.
Installation Orientation: Currently horizontal only.  We are exploring vertical orientation in the future.
Power Requirement: 120V/60Hz
 
Low Profile Engineering
Kapsul's significant reduction in size in comparison to existing units means that the view outside is no longer obstructed.  The patent-pending engineering required state-of-the-art CFD simulation and years of optimization to get into the final form factor Kapsul offers, trimming the total size by 40%. The highly engineered fans and ventilation system are quiet and efficient. Unlike other window air conditioners, Kapsul directs the cool air up towards the ceiling, creating a convective cycle that prevents cold and hot spots in the room. At 5,000 BTU/hr, Kapsul can cool a 10'x16' room, or two Kapsul units can cool a room up to 330 sq ft. 
 
Designed From the Ground Up
When we started this project, we knew window air conditioning needed more than just a pretty grill or smartphone control.  The whole user experience had to be rethought, and Kapsul had to be completely redesigned from the ground up.  Our modern and elegant design not only looks good but also addresses the irritations that users have with existing window AC designs.
 

Easy to Install
Kapsul comes with a special window frame adapter to ensure a safe and easy installation.  The adapter is installed first to create a secure, sealed socket into which Kapsul slides and locks in place.  No more struggling with a bulky object in an open window. The innovative handle and rounded sides further aid with installation, removal, and storage.

 
Kapsul slides and locks into place.
Simple User Interface
We've built Kapsul around a single knob that controls the thing you want to change - temperature.  Plug it in and set the thermostat. There's no complicated modes or settings. Users can set a schedule via the iOS and Android apps to ensure they never use more energy than is needed.
 

Setting the temperature couldn't be easier.
 Night mode is easy on your eyes.
Control Kapsul From iPhone or Android 
Kapsul can be set to a schedule by your iPhone or Android device, ensuring you can come home to a cool space without running your electricity all day. Our simple-to-use app allows you to control several Kapsul units at a time. 
App Wireframe
Using the Kapsul app, you can easily set up a weekly schedule to ensure you save energy without sacrificing comfort.
Total Room Circulation
Kapsul is designed to blow cold air upwards to mix with the warm air below as it falls.  This circulation removes the warm spots in the room while preventing cold air from being recirculated, which improves comfort and efficiency.

Easy Storage
If you are using Kapsul in a bedroom, you don't have to take it far when autumn arrives.  Kapsul's slim profile allows it to spend the off-season under your bed or in a closet.

Working Prototypes
During our two year development of Kapsul, we extensively modeled thermal performance to achieve the smallest possible form factor.  After building many small-scale heat exchanger prototypes to check our math, we built a fully functioning air conditioner using custom components made to our specifications.  
Currently, we have designed and built two full-scale prototypes.  One is a thermal prototype which actually works to pump heat at the size we have designed, and a user experience prototype which acts as a testbed for us to work on the installation experience, confirm the function of our light pipe and knob design, and continue to develop the iOS and Android apps to confirm software/hardware integration.

Risks and challenges
Kapsul has been in development for over two years, and in that time our team of experienced engineers and designers have addressed all the major technical hurdles associated with this product. After many prototypes and much analysis, Kapsul is ready to begin the road to production.
Kapsul worked with the team at Likuma Labs, an established product development firm that has experience bringing projects from the drawing board to the production line in various industries including consumer products, medical devices, and industrial automation. We know what it takes to bring hardware into production, and we know there will be challenges along the way.
No product development process is free from hiccups, and that's why we live by the mantra to ""prototype early and often."" We've budgeted a year to bring Kapsul into production and into your hands well before the Summer of 2017. We know this is a long time to wait, but Kapsul is a complex device with electronics and mechanical systems, and it must communicate with two separate apps (iOS and Android). Rather than rush to put out a buggy, 0th-generation product, we want our backers to have the user experience they deserve on the first day they open the box.
In the Summer of 2016 we plan to extensively test numerous pre-production units here in our own Philadelphia homes to work out all the bugs and kinks in the design and user interface so that we can move into full production knowing the design is ready for you. We've budgeted extra production time in case the first production units don't meet our exacting requirements. During the production roll-out, some specifications presented above may change slightly, such as precise dimensions and energy data. However, we believe the numbers presented to be a realistic outcome, and are not just optimistic estimates.
There is a risk that Kapsul will not be ready to ship in time for Spring of 2017. Given the seasonal nature of the product, a 3-6 month slip in timeline would result in Kapsul being delivered during or after the Summer of 2017. We know that backers would be incredibly disappointed in this result, and we are working late nights and weekends to minimize this risk. However, given the complexity of the supply chain management, regulatory requirements, and third-party safety verification required, backers should understand there is a risk the shipment timeline could slip into or beyond the Summer of 2017.
FAQ's
 
Can Kapsul be placed vertically in a window?
Kapsul is currently designed to only be placed horizontally. There are a number of engineering issues that must be addressed before Kapsul could be placed vertically, including compressor lubrication and condensate dripping. However, given the feedback from many interested parties, we are exploring incorporating this into the design as we move forward with production. However, potential backers should note that we cannot commit to accommodating a vertical installation at this time.
What type of window can Kapsul be installed in?
Kapsul can be installed in single or double-hung window frames.
What size window will Kapsul fit into?
Kapsul can be installed in windows 21'' to 36'' wide.
Must I remove my window screen before installing Kapsul?
Yes, the screen must be removed or slid out of the way before installing Kapsul.
When will Kapsul be available in my country?
Accommodating the electrical and regulatory requirements of each country will take time, and we can only commit to delivering Kapsul in the United States and Canada at this time.
What type of filter will Kapsul have?
Kapsul will have a standard screen filter that we recommend cleaning once per season. This filter is used to prevent dust from clogging the evaporator coils and is not meant to improve room air quality with regard to pollen, dust, or smoke.
Can I control Kapsul from outside my home?
Schedule creation and temperature adjustments made through the app may initially only work within your home.  However, the units will ship with Wi-Fi connectivity, and control via the Internet is a capability that is planned.
How does Kapsul remove the condensed water from inside the unit?
Kapsul's window frame adapter is designed to tilt the unit 3-degrees up so that the condensate can collect and drip outside of the window it's installed into. Kapsul will protrude about 8-9'' from the window, which will prevent water from dripping down the side of the building.
Is there a warranty?
Kapsul will ship with a 1-year warranty.
Can Kapsul be pushed back into the room from the outside?
No. Kapsul's frame adapter has spring-loaded locking cleats that latch once Kapsul is inserted. These cleats provide three functions.
1. Prevent someone from outside the home pushing Kapsul inside, 
2. Prevent a child from pulling Kapsul into the room on top of themselves, 
3. Allow Kapsul to pass the UL structural loading test which applies 400 pounds of downforce to the top of Kapsul on the outside of the building.
How far will Kapsul protrude from the window outside?
About 8-9'' of the unit will extend outside.
Is Kapsul lighter than existing window AC units?
Kapsul is approximately 8 pounds lighter than current window air conditioners of similar capacity. The ergonomics of Kapsul's installation and handle contribute significantly to its ease of installation in addition to the moderate reduction in weight. Precise weight figures will be available as the project nears completion.
Will Kapsul have a heating function?
No, Kapsul's heat pump only works one way – to cool the inside of a room.
Will Kapsul be HomeKit enabled?
This capability may not be available initially at the time of delivery, but HomeKit support is planned.
How much does it cost to run Kapsul?
Kapsul will cost about $50.00 to run during the summer months. This is an extremely rough estimation, based on the following calculation:
0.480 kilowatts x 9.5 hours of cooling per day x 90 cooling days per season x $0.12 per kilowatt hour = $49 dollars a summer.
Your energy needs will vary depending on your geography, how hot the summer is, at what temperature you set the room,  and how much electricity costs in your locale.
Can Kapsul run on batteries or solar power?
Kapsul is a 480 W, 110-120 V A/C appliance.  It can be powered by an appropriately sized solar and/or energy storage system with an inverter and appropriate electronics.  
Will Kapsul be available in any other colors?
Perhaps in the future, but for now Kapsul will only be available in a single color scheme.
Can I pick up my Kapsul to save on shipping if I live in or near Philadelphia?
Unfortunately, no. Kickstarter does not allow us to vary the shipping based on geographic location, and we aren't certain about where fulfillment will occur yet, either. Sorry about that!
Will Kapsul display Celsius?
The numbers printed around the knob are in Fahrenheit. We will include a Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion via the App.
What maintenance is required for Kapsul?
The refrigerant and lubricant are hermetically sealed during manufacture, so no serious maintenance will be required over the life of the product. The screen filter should be cleaned with water each season.
What is the lifespan of Kapsul?
Kapsul will have an average lifespan of about 10 years depending on the amount of use it gets.
Can Kapsul be installed in an RV or another vehicle?
Not at the moment. RV installation will require a custom adapter that we haven't provisioned for. If you decided to modify Kapsul or it's adapter in any way that's up to you but it won't be UL certified for safety.
Can Kapsul be installed directly into a wall?
We ask that Kapsul is installed per our directions in a single or double-hung window. If you decided to modify it in any way that's up to you but it won't be UL certified for safety.
Does Kapsul come with a surge protector?
There is an LCDI plug on our 6 foot cable per UL requirements.
What type of cable/plug will Kapsul have?
Kapsul comes with a 6' power cord that features an LCDI 3-prong plug suitable for 120V outlets.
What material is Kapsul constructed from?
Materials will mainly be painted metal and a minimal amount of UV-resistant plastic. All materials will be in compliance with Underwriter Laboratories requirements for rain, corrosion, and UV resistance.
How did you come up with the name ""Kapsul""?
We considered hundreds of words using an anagram generator. Kapsul came up, and it turned out to be an old, unused dictionary word for a type of water wheel. Since our internal fans and dial-display all look a bit like wheels, we thought it was a fitting name!",26.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Single-use plastic is bad and it needs to go. By helping you move to solid bars ScrubsUp helps you reduce your plastic footprint. No more single-use bottles, just rinse your case and replace your bar. Easy.</p>
<p>Not only do you cut down on the amount of single-use plastic you use but solid bars help you reduce your carbon footprint. Up to 95% of liquid shower products are made up of water. By not transporting all that water around the world solid bars help you significantly reduce your CO2 footprint.  </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2>Environmental Commitment</h2>
<h3>Long-lasting design</h3>
<p>In order to make sure that the ScrubsUp case is something that you buy once and that lasts for a lifetime, we have made sure to use long-lasting and resistant materials so you don't have to worry about it breaking and leaving you without a way to ScrubUp!</p>
<h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3>
<p>By making the case out of recycled plastic we will be reducing global plastic waste on two fronts. First by helping people reduce the amount of plastic they are throwing away (by using a single shampoo bar you eliminate the waste of 3 plastic shampoo bottles). The second is by taking the plastic that people have already thrown out and giving it a new life and making the ScrubsUp case!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Doing something new always involves some risks. That being said, we have spent a lot of time thinking about and mitigating the risks that could come our way. Be it from identifying various manufacturing partners to carrying out extensive testing and design reviews to make sure that our final design will work exactly as we want it to and, most importantly, for as long as we want it to!</p>
<p>Obviously, the current COVID-19 crisis continues to change and challenge the world in unexpected ways. We are aware that this could lead to some issues with getting the product in your hands-on time. Never the less we are reassured by the fact that even during the height of the COVID-19 crisis in the UK we still had clear and actionable paths to manufacture available. </p>
<p>Overall, we want you, our backers, to rest assured that no matter what challenges get thrown our way we will resolve them and get you Scrubbing Up as soon as possible.</p>

Single-use plastic is bad and it needs to go. By helping you move to solid bars ScrubsUp helps you reduce your plastic footprint. No more single-use bottles, just rinse your case and replace your bar. Easy.
Not only do you cut down on the amount of single-use plastic you use but solid bars help you reduce your carbon footprint. Up to 95% of liquid shower products are made up of water. By not transporting all that water around the world solid bars help you significantly reduce your CO2 footprint.  




At ScrubsUp we believe that clean people should not mean a dirty planet. We created a unique bar case and offer a range of shampoo, conditioner and ""everything"" bars to help you make the transition to solid shower products! 
This is the clean, convenient and conscious alternative for your daily shower routine. Together, we can make a difference and reduce single-use plastic and CO2 emissions!
 We aren't planning on stopping here! There are so many things in our day to day life that are unnecessarily wasteful and inconvenient. As a result, we already have a pipeline of other ideas for helping you live a more convenient life whilst being more environmentally friendly. We are excited to take our backers along the journey along with us!

Environmental Commitment
Long-lasting design
In order to make sure that the ScrubsUp case is something that you buy once and that lasts for a lifetime, we have made sure to use long-lasting and resistant materials so you don't have to worry about it breaking and leaving you without a way to ScrubUp!
Reusability and recyclability
By making the case out of recycled plastic we will be reducing global plastic waste on two fronts. First by helping people reduce the amount of plastic they are throwing away (by using a single shampoo bar you eliminate the waste of 3 plastic shampoo bottles). The second is by taking the plastic that people have already thrown out and giving it a new life and making the ScrubsUp case!

Risks & Challenges
Doing something new always involves some risks. That being said, we have spent a lot of time thinking about and mitigating the risks that could come our way. Be it from identifying various manufacturing partners to carrying out extensive testing and design reviews to make sure that our final design will work exactly as we want it to and, most importantly, for as long as we want it to!
Obviously, the current COVID-19 crisis continues to change and challenge the world in unexpected ways. We are aware that this could lead to some issues with getting the product in your hands-on time. Never the less we are reassured by the fact that even during the height of the COVID-19 crisis in the UK we still had clear and actionable paths to manufacture available. 
Overall, we want you, our backers, to rest assured that no matter what challenges get thrown our way we will resolve them and get you Scrubbing Up as soon as possible.",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

 MarsCat is the world’s first bionic pet cat developed by Elephant Robotics, aiming to be a home robot, a robotic pet to comfort you and surprise you. Just like a real cat, MarsCat is fully autonomous. No extra instruction is needed to control its movements.It is fully responsive and has sensitive interactions. It can feel your touch, hear your voice, see your face and play with toys. Every MarsCat is unique from its eyes, body to personality, its personality will change according to the way you pet it. With powerful quad-core Raspberry PI, you can also program it easily and give it endless possibilities. MarsCat can also be an ideal choice for education, research and commerce.  
A Bionic Cat, a Programmable Home Robot with Endless Possibilities 
 Bionic and IndependentMarsCat Surprises You You will never know what MarsCat will do next because it is like a real cat, fully autonomous. MarsCat acts independently without any instructions. MarsCat walks, runs, sleeps, sits, stretches, bites nails, kneads and even buries litter although she won’t produce any waste.   It may express different emotions by different meows or gestures. Sometimes it may do some amazing things that surprise you and make your day! 16 servo motors to make MarsCat more bionic 

 Highly InteractiveMarsCat Delights You MarsCat is a good companion, it is fully responsive and interactive. It can play with you or your toys because it can feel, hear and see. Touch its head, chin or back to find out what it will react! It can also interact with objects or people nearby, even play with real cats.    
 


 
Feel: You can touch its head, jaw and back or even hug it.Hear: You can talk to MarsCat to order it to walk or come to you, but it will not always follow your command, it has its own feeling.        See: MarsCat will see you or see its own toys. MarsCat can play Teasers (by moving object recognition), Toy-ball, Toy-fish or find its own bed.        Unique and Personality DevelopingMarsCat is Shaped by You MarsCat is unique from its eyes, body to personality. MarsCat has 6 characters which can be changed. She may be enthusiastic or aloof, energetic or lazy, social or shy. Her personality develops through the way you pet her. The factors that express MarsCat’s personality: 
Frequency of speaking
Enthusiastic or not when having interaction
Frequency of movement
Tone of sounds…
MarsCat will be more enthusiastic if you interact with her more, be more talkative if you talk to it more…      Open Sourced and ProgrammableMarsCat is Redefined by You   
 MarsCat is open-sourced, we use 4 main threads to process: Vision (qr_code, object_recognition, face_recognition and moving object recognition), Voice (command and volume db), Sensors (gyro sensor, touch sensor and distance sensor) and AI (process all data and do the output actions) . The action will include movements of 16 motors and kinematics + eye-display + sound effect.     You can customize your own MarsCat's eyeball with regular eye color / a blink / a heart / a lightning or anything you like. The API is quite easy to use. Just drop a 128x128 png/jpg file will work.You can program MarsCat easily and make it with endless possibilities. With powerful quad-core Raspberry Pi, you can create your own applications. MarsCat is also an ideal choice for education, research and commerce.    We are preparing a wireless charger for MarsCat now! MarsCat will have its own bed ""charging station"". (First version of the rendering for your reference)
 
For all MarsCat's designers, you can now find MarsCat's open source code  from here  → https://github.com/elephantrobotics/marsai

We have made an improvement of MarsCat's tail,  the tail will be changed to a rubber coverage, more flexible one.

Open SDKWith MarsCat SDK, you will have access to a huge amount of sensors and actuators at the same time to fulfill your own Cat applications. Also Protocol and library are open-source embedded in Raspberry PI. Everyone can build your own function of cat for education and commercial usages.The sensors/ actuators you can access includes: 
Camera
Camera - face, QR code and object recognition
Voice Mic
Voice - Commands recognition
TOF distance laser sensor
Multiple Capacitance Touch sensor
All 16 servo motors: control angles, speed, torque, ID, and receive the data
Sounds - as you want
2 x OLED display on the eye  
Secondary DevelopmentMarsCat will be open sourced after this campaign. We choose to open source because we think every people could be the creator of this new creature, you can customize any functions or applications yourself. Helping everyone enjoy Robots World is what we dream to do.    
 Artificial IntelligenceThe brain of vertebrates consists of forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Animals receive different stimulations (endocrine system) and release different hormones into blood to influence body and behavior through its central nervous system.As a bionic cat, in ethology, MarsCat should not only sense like a real cat but also behave like a real one. So the classical artificial intelligence is used into MarsCat. It enabled the sequence from sensor to action.     
 How Personality Grows
 Like a real cat. It has different characters and personalities. Some cats are vivacious, while some are lazy. Some cats are aloof while some are more close to human. Also, some cats are super curious and they meow frequently.MarsCat is built to allow you to shape its personalities. More interactions with MarsCat will impel it to be more close to you. More conversations with MarsCat will impel it to meow to you often. Every time you touch it, talk to it or even let it see you, will change its personality. Industrial DesignWe wanted Mars to be an approachable and instantly likable companion, full of character. However, designing a robotic cat is no easy task. Under its skin, Mars is packed with electronics, motors, gears, batteries, sensors, displays and a structural skeleton with joints. All of this adds up to some very challenging space and movement constraints that had to be considered when trying to design a friendly feline exterior.  
 Our starting point in the industrial design process was the initial form factor and technical envelope, coupled with studies of other toy and cartoon cats, as well as the anatomy of real cats. We went through many iterations of the industrial design, often doing multiple design studies for key parts to evaluate the technical performance as well as the visual proportions and expression. 
 Once we had honed in on a general shape we felt comfortable with, we started looking at the finer details and massaging the design. We also worked hard to reduce the number of visible parts and carefully manage any split lines and assembly features.Since Mars is essentially one fixed shape, we have developed different colour and pattern schemes to offer users differentiation and customization opportunities. ManufacturingSince we are a robotic company and we supply automation solutions to customers in the past 4 years. So we decide to produce the MarsCat by our own, and plan to use our robotic arms to manufacture MarsCat in the future.

<p>In the times of IoT, everything seems to be connected and smart. Unfortunately, robot vacuum cleaners available in the market are just not quite there yet. They fall short to completely free up our hands from house cleaning because of their deficiency in obstacle avoidance, deep cleaning, house mapping etc. Neabot NoMo Q11 lifts the <strong>AI obstacle avoidance technology </strong>to a whole new level. It utilizes <strong>3D scanning &amp; mapping</strong> instead of 2D that's widely used by competing products. Together with the <strong>most advanced route planning algorithm</strong>, Neabot Q11 plans better cleaning routes than any other robot vacuums and achieves <strong>an industry-high cleaning rate of 91%</strong>. The compact  body, <strong>3.4-inch in height,</strong> easily gets under beds and sofas. Its <strong>unbeatable suction power of 4000Pa</strong> is one of the strongest on the market. When getting on carpet, it automatically boost the suction to give the carpet a much more thorough cleaning. Q11 comes with an <strong>interactive APP of its own</strong>, on which you can easily set the cleaning areas or the <strong>no-go zones</strong>. We’ve had noise reduction in mind from day one, so that you and your family can have your life/work undisturbed while Neabot Q11 gets your house cleaned up. In addition to all above wonderful features, the uniqued design of Q11 stands out in a very visually pleasing way.</p>

<p>Built upon the <strong>dToF detection technology and 3D imaging algorithm</strong>, Neabot Q11's AI obstacle avoidance system <strong>features 4 beam LiDARs</strong>. As a cutting edge technology widely used in <strong>autonomous driving by leading self-driving car makers</strong> around the world, Beam LiDAR is characterized by its long detecting range and high imaging fidelity. It helps self-driving cars to see the world more clearly, so that the cars can plan better routes, and detect and avoid obstacles faster and more accurately. With this technology integrated, Neabot Q11 can accurately recognize chair feet, magazines, cables and pet droppings etc. For every cleaning task, Q11 <strong>optimizes the cleaning route and avoids obstacles</strong>, completing the task in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Q11 can accurately <strong>identify all kinds of small objects and stains</strong>, and adjust its course of action accordingly. You never have to worry about Q11 smearing dog poop all over your house, or getting tangled up by wires or other small objects.</p>

Unfortunately, robot vacuum cleaners available in the market are just not quite there yet. They fall short to completely free up our hands from house cleaning because of their deficiency in obstacle avoidance, deep cleaning, house mapping etc. Neabot NoMo Q11 lifts the AI obstacle avoidance technology to a whole new level. It utilizes 3D scanning & mapping instead of 2D that's widely used by competing products. Together with the most advanced route planning algorithm, Neabot Q11 plans better cleaning routes than any other robot vacuums and achieves an industry-high cleaning rate of 91%. The compact  body, 3.4-inch in height, easily gets under beds and sofas. Its unbeatable suction power of 4000Pa is one of the strongest on the market. When getting on carpet, it automatically boost the suction to give the carpet a much more thorough cleaning. Q11 comes with an interactive APP of its own, on which you can easily set the cleaning areas or the no-go zones. We’ve had noise reduction in mind from day one, so that you and your family can have your life/work undisturbed while Neabot Q11 gets your house cleaned up. In addition to all above wonderful features, the uniqued design of Q11 stands out in a very visually pleasing way.

neabot NoMo Q11 im Test - Der extrem flache Saugroboter mit Laser in der Front!
 

 


 

 
Built upon the dToF detection technology and 3D imaging algorithm, Neabot Q11's AI obstacle avoidance system features 4 beam LiDARs. As a cutting edge technology widely used in autonomous driving by leading self-driving car makers around the world, Beam LiDAR is characterized by its long detecting range and high imaging fidelity. It helps self-driving cars to see the world more clearly, so that the cars can plan better routes, and detect and avoid obstacles faster and more accurately. With this technology integrated, Neabot Q11 can accurately recognize chair feet, magazines, cables and pet droppings etc. For every cleaning task, Q11 optimizes the cleaning route and avoids obstacles, completing the task in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Q11 can accurately identify all kinds of small objects and stains, and adjust its course of action accordingly. You never have to worry about Q11 smearing dog poop all over your house, or getting tangled up by wires or other small objects.
 

 

 

 
*Q11 may not recognize liquids, but can clean water stains on the floor. *Q11 does not have a camera to capture image so your privacy will never be breached. *Q11 does not recognize objects under 2cm in height.

 
    Unlike most robot vacuums with their radar stacked on top, Neabot Q11 hides the Beam LiDARs inside the body, significantly reducing the thickness of the robot. Q11 is merely 3.4” in height and can easily roam under sofas, beds and cupboards etc.  Traditional robot vacuums go only where you can see, leaving much of your floor unattended. We reduced the height of Neabot Q11 to a mere 3.4"" by hiding the LiDARs inside, so that it can go under beds and sofas and such to give your house a much more thorough cleaning it desperately needs.    If you ever had a robot vacuum before, it’s quite likely you’ve seen it tumbling down the stairs. That is never going to happen to Neabot Q11, thanks to those 4 most sensitive anti-drop sensors built in. This is a safety measure for the robot itself, your house, but most importantly you and your family.   *NEABOT Q11 can climb on and off carpet from hard floor effortlessly. It can climb over obstacles ≤2cm.    The base station also serves as a charging station. Whenever the robot is docked in, it is charging. When the batteries run low in the middle of a task, it automatically goes back to the base station for charging. In addition, the energy dense batteries built in could power the robot for 150-minute vacuuming or cleaning 2100sqft house. So you’ll never have to be concerned about its batteries running low.  Neabot Q11 not only has a 250ml dust box built in the robot but also has a 2.5L supersize self-emptying dustbin. When the robot finishes a task and goes back to the station, trash in the dust box is transferred into the 2.5L self-emptying dustbin so you don’t have to empty the dust box manually. The collector is big enough for trash of approximately 30 days, although it varies with the size of your house. When it's full, all you need to do is lifting your fingers to take it out.    What does it mean for a robot vacuum to have a suction power of 4000Pa? To put it in perspective, most competing products in the market are between 1,000pa and 2,000pa. Neabot Q11 boasts a suction power of 4000Pa. This may seems unreal considering its compact size. But that’s what NEABOT Q11 is.   No matter it’s flour, grains, beans or even marbles, the powerful Neabot Q11 can handle with ease. Wherever Neabot Q11 has scrolled by is spotless. Now you don't have to worry about your kids running around the house bare-footed. Manual vacuuming? Never again!         Semi-Enclosed Leak Proof StructureThe base station of Q11 is in a semi-enclosed structure that prevents water from leaking out of the mop. Water overruns and soaks up your beloved wooden floor? Never happens. HEPA Filter    Smooth surfaces such as marble floor needs vacuuming plus wet mopping, while carpets and rugs are best cleaned with stronger suction power. Neabot Q11 has different cleaning plans for them all. On carpets and rugs, it automatically increases suction power to 2500Pa to get rid of dust deep down the plush. On hard floors, the robot automatically decreases the suction to save energy.* Turn off mopping when vacuuming carpets and rugs. What makes a great cleaning robot? Neabot Q11 sets the bar to a new high. 200 rmp for sweeping, 4000pa for vacuuming and 4-level precision water control for mopping, Q11 is literally an all-rounder. And that is what makes a good cleaning robot.    Remote App ControlWe've designed an app specifically for Neabot Q11, on which you can monitor & control the robot, schedule cleanings, and set cleaning areas as well as virtual no-go zones even when you're away from home, saving you the trouble of placing physical obstacles to stop the robot for entering certain parts of your house. You can also manually control the robot on Neabot APP, which displays in over 20 languages and voices. We want you to be able to operate the machine in your most familiar language.  Multi-Floor MappingYou have a big house of multi-story? That's no problem for Neabot Q11, as our Neabot APP can store up to 3 separate maps. No matter which floor it is on, Q11 will know which map to use and there's no need to do remapping.   Bluetooth Assisted Network Configuration While most cleaning robots can only be paired with your smart phone via wifi, which sometimes can be a rather disheartening experience because of failures and delays, Neabot Q11 provides you an alternative, Bluetooth. It’s much simpler, faster and more reliable.   Neabot Q11 has a suction power of 4000Pa, one rarely seen in robot vacuums of comparable size. That doesn't give us reason to settle for less noise cancellation. Instead, we have many smart designs and delicate mechanisms to reduce Q11's noise level, so it'll leave you and your family undisturbed for work, study, a nap, a movie, yoga exercise and even meditation.*Noise level varies under different work conditions. Under Silent Mode, 650pa suction, Neabot Q11 is 65dB.   Unboxing Video Neabot App Introduction

It can detect any obstacle as long as it's taller than 2cm.b. The suction power - Q11 is 4000Pa, the max on the market. N1 is 2700Pa.c. Q11 features a 300ml water tank, meanwhile N1 doesn't have mopping feature, N1Plus as but it's not electric controlled water tank.d. Q11 saves 3 maps. N1 saves 1 map.e.

Simply put, it's the finest towel we've had the pleasure of using to date.Our Japanese manufacturer has decades of experience. Working together we have selected the finest cotton for purpose and zero twist softness.Inspiring peace and tranquility to create the perfect balance of form and function - without compromise. Get ready to upgrade your bathroom to a spa-like oasis. Every. Single. Day.  That's where Sento 2 comes in, introducing the towels fit for an emperor or empress. We have chosen only the finest natural materials and implemented specialized manufacturing techniques developed in Japan. Relentlessly pursuing the finest methods to create a product of the utmost quality.      The Japanese zero-twist design is luxuriously soft, super absorbent, quick drying and so effortlessly fluffy and light it feels like a cloud. We know you will love it too! 
 
   The Japanese have been perfecting the art of towel making for hundreds of years. Used by the upper class of society in the 17th Century including the Samurai.  They still carry on this tradition focusing on superior craftsmanship and simplicity.   Like all Sento products, our new towels are packed full of features and meticulously engineered. They are designed from the ground up to be both the best bath towels and the best everyday towels on the planet.    Regular terry loop towels typically twist their cotton strands repeatedly, forming thick rope-like loops. These thick strands are much easier (and lower cost) to work with.    Sento's premium zero twist design allows the natural cotton fibers to remain loose and fluffy. The intricate and time consuming process of working with zero twist fibers is very rewarding, as it yields towels unbelievably gentle and soft. The effortless elegance is quickly apparent to anyone who experiences the towel.   Inspired by our passion for the finer things in life, Japanese craftsmanship and attention to detail.  Many towels are made of cotton, but the look and feel of towels largely depends on what type of cotton is used. Towels designed and priced for everyday use are made of sub-standard methods.   Sento is made with true Zero Twist yarns designed to leave the cotton fibers free. The result is a fabric with an extra fluffy texture that maintains an airy softness, evoking the feel of a cloud.   Sento fabric is ultra-soft, super-fluffy and designed for high-end spas and hotels with it's luxurious look and feel.     The zero twist process allows each cotton fiber to retain its natural texture – and its luxurious softness – allowing the fabric to remain ‘open’ to the air.   The openness greatly increases absorbency allowing air to permeate the fabric, moisture simply disappears and the towel dries quickly after each use. While the towel is remarkably voluminous, full of high quality cotton, it remains incredibly light for its size.    Once we discovered its effect on our prototype towels we knew our next project had to be Zero Twist.   Sento 2 achieves unprecedented softness. It really needs to be experienced to be believed.   Every single Sento towel is made with painstaking dedication to achieve industry leading perfection.   Harsh water containing undesirably minerals and heavy metals can damage towels during production. Sento uses only the softest water sourced from the mountains is used to create our towels. White, Royal Blue, Stone, Red, Dark Navy (From left to Right)  Sento was born and raised on Kickstarter. In 2016 we launched the Sento Towel. Thanks to our incredible backers and supporters, over 20,000 people worldwide now enjoy our products every day.     Where We Are Our second towel project has been heavily tested and refined with over a year of development. We have developed strong and stable partnerships with local craftspeople and supply chains. We are ready to go! We have a design that has been heavily tested and refined at every step along the way.

The spark came from one incident that happened one morning.  It was an ordinary morning when I switched on my toaster for making breakfast, the toaster sparkled and flickered with flame out of the blue. Dangerous it was, I know, but it was awkwardly mesmerizing to watch the spark and flare flickering from the toaster. From there, I wondered how I could turn this actual enthralling and fascinating flame into a functional product that could mimic that beguilingly relaxing moment. After putting tremendous effort and carrying out countless experiments on R&D, I created this “i-Flame Diffuser” by integrating virtual flame into an essential oil diffuser.This is the story of the “i-Flame Diffuser”, from turning a fancy thought into an authentic useful product. We try the best to design... Start as sketches and allows us to generate the ideas quickly, sharing and discussing with our teammates, focusing on the form, creativity and iteration. Trying to explore more than one precise depiction of single concept, end up as a 2D&3D drawings before going into next stage-prototyping.

It has a hardness rating of 60HRC, meaning it’s REALLY tough and durable.This supreme shaving machine combines 4 blades with an 8-direction foil head and 8,000 rpm motor to give you the fastest, gentlest shave ever. 8000rpm x 4 blades = 32,000 cutting actions per minute and 100% satisfaction. Get the smoothest shave in under 2 minutes!Leading electric shavers max out at a 30º angle. SMATE gives you a 27º angle for the smoothest shave ever. We designed SMATE 360 using Voronoi geometry to create the perfect shaving angle for ultimate efficiency and closeness.Okay, Wait a Second. Voronoi Geometry?Yeah, we said it. We achieved the closest shave possible by applying Voronoi Geometry principles to SMATE 360’s blade angle. To get the blade as close as possible without being too close for comfort, we used insight from the Voronoi diagram, named after Russian mathematician Georgy Voronoy.Voronoi diagrams separate points into sections so that each point is closest to just 1 other point and no others. Point A (the blade) gets as close as possible to Point B (hairs), without coming too close to point C (skin).It’s not the “most efficient shave ever” if you have to lather up with shaving cream—which is why you don’t. The SMATE 360 works the same whether you’re wet, dry or using shaving cream. It’s rated IPX7 waterproof so you can shave in the shower and clean it under running water.No more dreading your daily shave or nicking yourself in a rush.The 4 cutter system and 8 active directional foil head gives you a smooth shave without sharp edges.The average man spends over $100 per year on disposable razor blades and more than 2 billion are thrown away annually. Switching to SMATE 360 means no more changing your razor blade every week.SMATE 360’s motor lasts 10 years. All you have to do is replace the outer head 1 year and the inner head every 2 years. With that kind of reliability, it’s no wonder the affordable price tag stirs competition in the shaving industry!Hate shaving when you're in a rush or late to work? Not to worry. Looking good doesn’t have to take a huge chunk of your morning, just 180 seconds.SMATE 360’s durable Anlai steel blades move at 32,000 clips per minute to give you a spotless shave in 3 minutes, every time. And you don’t have to worry about missing a patch when you’re a little distracted—the 27º angle shaves all the spots other razors miss.SMATE 360 does more than cut down your shaving time.And when you forget to charge it? SMATE 360’s lithium-ion battery lasts 30 days without charge and uses a Type C USB port for the most convenient charging. It’s also equipped with a LED light indicator to notify you when the battery is low.The SMATE 360 was created to fit into your busy life. You get a gentle shave, free of bumps, cuts and pain without any water. Shave dry, wet, with or without shaving cream, or even in the shower.  Let your skin adjust to a shave this good.Your beard and skin will need time to adjust to a shave so close. This is normal. As a result, your face may feel a bit sensitive after a shave in the first few weeks of use.Don't worry though! Give it time and you'll experience the full joy of the closest, fastest shave you'll ever get. No need to purchase disposable razors *just* for your upcoming trip.

On top of that, a survey found that men ages <a href=""https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19547899/why-you-should-really-wash-your-sheets-more-frequently-you-do/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">18-25 wash their sheets four times in a year</a>, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/TUS/CHARTS/HOUSEHOLD.HTM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">on average, men do 1/4th the amount of laundry as women</a>. This fact means that these sheets are only being washed once per month. When we discovered these numbers, we realized that it meant we had to make sure our sheets have powerful anti-bacterial features, and we did just that. Our sheets will stay cleaner for longer and require less washing. The anti-bacterial fabric keeps the bed sheets clean while helping your skin stay bacteria and acne-free.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579127549/th8ignzcigtpkdh05miv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579127585/lprd7l5bxuhudivvszo9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579127601/hnvnis5x86gzgg3mvovd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>When it comes to washing sheets, most people don't know how to do so correctly, and that leads to pilling.

The breath-ability prevents excess sweating, and the absorbency helps keep you dry, allowing your body to stay at the perfect temperature all night long.When it came to smoothness, we made sure you will have a silk-level experience while sleeping on Jax Sheets. Smoothness and softness are essential for every sex, but more so for men, because they tend to have more body hair and sleep with fewer clothes on. So by having a smooth and soft surface, their overall sleep experience would be improved.Would you sleep on your toilet? Did you know that after one week of sleeping on your sheets, your bed has 17,442 times more bacteria than your toilet seat and 24,631 times more bacteria than your bathroom door handle?

Don't worry; we fixed this issue by doubling our elastic and making it adjustable, so no one has to be attacked by their sheets in the middle of the night.  Dermatologists recommend that, unless you like acne, you should wash your pillowcase every 2-3 days.

Strong enough to tackle the grimiest of dishes, yet gentle enough to keep your pots and pans scratch-free. The heavy-duty brush head & bristles are 100% plant-based, made from wood & sisal fibers.




 

Turn over the brush for a durable built-in scrubber.

Get that stuck on grime without scratching pots and pans 
Reusable scrubber that is washable
Easy to use & very effective
Watch that stuck on gunk come off without damaging your pots and pans 


 
Strong enough to tackle the dirtiest dishes.

The natural sisal bristles are known for their strength, durability, and anti-microbial properties. 
The ergonomic handle ensures comfort.  
The replaceable brush head is compostable, you replace the part that gets old. Keep the part that still works. It's a win-win. 


 
Sustainable Design Meets Functional Cleaning
Meet our newest creation, Do the Dishes Brush. It’s the eco-friendly brush you didn’t know you were waiting for!
 

Our Do the Dishes brush checks all boxes!
We analyzed leading dish brush brands, Amazon bestsellers, and did A LOT of dishes. We saw a big opportunity to keep plastic out of landfills (and oceans) and leverage the superpowers of our planet's natural materials.

Our Do The Dishes Brush: Make Better Choices Every Day
✓Uses plastic wisely with its durable and re-usable recycled plastic handle (that's ergonomic)! ✓Has a replaceable and compostable brush head.✓Naturally effective thanks to the sisal bristle fibers.✓MamaP gives back! Each color represents a different social or environmental cause we support.

 
 
What Makes This Dish Brush Different? 
Replaceable brush heads made out of natural materials (wood and sisal fibers). Plastic handle made of post-consumer recycled plastic. Diverting waste from landfills. Ergonomically designed handle for a better more comfortable grip. 

 
How It Works: Replace, Compost, That's It!
We recommend replacing your brush head every 1 – 2 months. 

Remove head
Drop-in your backyard compost bin
Feel good about helping our planet while keeping your dishes sparkly clean


MamaP's Press Coverage
Press loves us, and so do our customers! We're proud to have been featured in great publications like Wall Street Journal, Rachael Ray, and Forbes.

We Started With One Question - Why Don’t Compostable Dish Brushes Work As Well as Plastic Ones?
We spent countless months talking to people to understand what they’re looking for in their cleaning brushes. We also tested dish brushes ourselves for over three years.

The Solution: Do The Dishes Brush
Reduce. Reuse. Compost the part that needs replacing and re-use the part that lasts forever!! WIN. WIN.

Traditional Dish Brushes Are Made With 100% Virgin Plastic. 
After a couple of months of use they get grimey and need to be replaced.  You throw it in your trash, and it ends up in a landfill or the ocean. Keep our oceans clean. Keep Microplastics out of our water (and our bodies).

 
Using a Sponge is Not Much Better 
""362 different kinds of bacteria are on sponges."" -Time Magazine
Sponges have been scientifically proven to harbor more bacteria than your toilet (no, thanks)! 
And, they’re also made of plastics that aren’t biodegradable. Keep your dishes and the planet clean. Don't use a sponge!

The Problem We Want To Solve
We really want clean dishes, but we ultimately care about having a clean EARTH.
Our Objective: to minimize plastic waste. In the US we currently throw out over 400 MILLION plastic dish brushes and sponges. EVERY. SINGLE. YEAR. This plastic isn't going anywhere good. It's all ending up in our oceans. Let's clean more than our dishes.

Current Eco Brushes Don't Cut It
Most eco brushes are stiff, have handles that are prone to rot, and are uncomfortable to hold.

MamaP's Do The Dishes Brush is ergonomic, comfortable to hold, and its handle is made from recycled plastic. There's no need to throw the whole thing out! Simply replace the brush head as necessary (or every couple months). The brush heads are compostable too!

<p>The Mateo Sit-Stand Desk. It’s a story of a small business that believes in beauty and functionality. It’s a story of thoughtful design and quality equipment coming together to create something you can enjoy and be proud of while minimizing clutter and waste. It’s a story of love — we love to create things that you love to use.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/51r4f7jedkjr41i/deskfeatures.jpg?dl=0"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Mateo has set out to redefine the work environment, and we’re starting that conversation with the Sit-Stand. It’s simple. Beautiful. Smart. Functional. Ergonomic. It’s the first in what will become a series of innovations that will make the office environment a more enjoyable place, whether you’re at home, in an office, coworking, at school, or even outdoors.</p>
<p>Think about it — how much time do you spend at work? Why can’t your work environment be as inspiring as it is functional? Who wants a bunch of clutter and cords showing all the time, especially when your office is also your home? Why build something flimsy out of materials that are wasteful? Why not have a work environment that inspires you and creates a sense of comfort?<br/> </p>

<p>The founders of Mateo come from a long line of farmers. We like to grow things and have a background as artists and sculptors.

We are a collective of diverse problem solvers. We understand all aspects of our trade, from how a tree becomes a table to how to take a dream design to reality and everything in-between. We have the knowledge, the tools, and the know-how to turn even the wildest design ideas into tangible realities. Our fabrication studio uses the latest technologies, coupled with our team's deep knowledge of traditional woodworking. And our products are focused on how we can use design to eliminate waste. </p>

</div></div>","Live a more inspired life with Mateo. A high quality, beautifully designed workspace that enables a more productive, creative, and curated life. 



 

The Mateo Sit-Stand Desk. It’s a story of a small business that believes in beauty and functionality. It’s a story of thoughtful design and quality equipment coming together to create something you can enjoy and be proud of while minimizing clutter and waste. It’s a story of love — we love to create things that you love to use.

Mateo has set out to redefine the work environment, and we’re starting that conversation with the Sit-Stand. It’s simple. Beautiful. Smart. Functional. Ergonomic. It’s the first in what will become a series of innovations that will make the office environment a more enjoyable place, whether you’re at home, in an office, coworking, at school, or even outdoors.
Think about it — how much time do you spend at work? Why can’t your work environment be as inspiring as it is functional? Who wants a bunch of clutter and cords showing all the time, especially when your office is also your home? Why build something flimsy out of materials that are wasteful? Why not have a work environment that inspires you and creates a sense of comfort? 


 

There are some key features in our desks that we want to point out:

<p>Clair is built with the purpose of lessening your energy output; with the ability to work wirelessly, fold easily, and be fully managed at a distance, this fan takes the hassle out of cooling off.</p>
<p><strong>Weighing in at just 9 pounds</strong>, Clair can be comfortably picked up and placed. As it is wireless, the only effort you need to put in is where to place it.</p>
<p>Once situated, you can sit wherever you’d like and take the fan’s remote control with you, allowing you to calibrate and occasionally adjust the settings for the fan. These settings include air speed, rotation, and hours active. You also have the option to turn the fan off or select the night mode, which reduces the LED brightness and reduces the air speed to the lowest setting.</p>
<p><strong>The fan can run up to 7 hours on battery life, and the air speed increases incrementally from level 1 up to level 4.</strong> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>No More Crosswires</h3>
<p>There’s no need to decide what gets unplugged for Clair; you can leave everything as is and undisturbed. Save the extension plugs and crowded outlets for something else, because this fan can operate without those pesky wires. On the lowest speed, Clair can actually run up to 20 hours of battery life, letting you worry about one less thing to monitor.</p>

<h3>Take Clair Outside</h3>
<p>Finding outlets inside can be a hassle, sure, but what about outside? You won’t need to worry about finding a place to plug in outside either because Clair takes away the restriction of a wire. Enjoy Clair on your patio, during a picnic, or even while camping. The blades are easily washable, helping you keep the outdoors outside of your house.</p>

<h3>Hassle-Free Storability</h3>
<p>Clair folds into a flat shape, making it rather easy to slide into places to be stored, such as under the bed, between furniture, or propped up in the closet. Simply fold Clair by tilting it down 90 degrees into its flat position and tuck away anywhere. Its sleek design and light material provide easy access to any family member.</p>

<h3>Keeps You Cool in Ways You Didn’t Know You Could Be</h3>
<p>Clair’s head can rotate 180 degrees, allowing you to determine the best angle to cool you off. The main body itself can automatically rotate 120 degrees, although you have the ability to turn this rotation on and off as you need it with the remote control. Unlike other fans, Clair provides a myriad of options for you to consider in order to create a cool environment that is to your liking. </p>

We can follow different strategies of product creation, from a bare bones idea on the whiteboard to the fully launched HW and SW products.  We developed an optimised model for greensens  such that we can provide you with a product with valuable functionality and the very best German quality.Almost from the beginning, we found our reliable manufacturing partner, and adjusted our design to the manufacturing processes to optimise the technology and costs. It was  great support for our development to create a product that has the best functionality and quality. Here are some images from our supplier sites.The most expensive parts in the production process are to create an injection Mold for plastic parts and setup the electronics production line. We need your support to bring greensens smart sensors in life.Flowers and plants  live so much longer with a flower sensor from greensens - and that's why you'll love them! Order now greensens Houseplant Sensor and enjoy the beauty of your plants.Your plants will love it - and so will you! Back this project NOW!  We worked hard on product development and spent a lot of time researching the best partner for reliable and quality manufacturing. greensens sensors were developed based on feedback from our partners, to achieve the highest level of production efficiency, thereby making all processes easy and fast-moving. One of the key aspects is a quality check, and we have quality assurance people at the production site to bring you the very best possible product.Plastic injection Mold: We work with leading product designers who help us prepare the body for easy and efficient production. Our surface finish has strict requirements, so we may expect some delays here to reach the best quality.Certification: The process of certification depends on many factors and may influence our timeline.Our strong relationship with the manufacturer will ensure the manufacturing process goes smoothly to provide the Kickstarter community the quality they deserve and expect.All in all, we can’t control and predict everything. With that said, we promise to be transparent and communicate every change in our production process to ensure we meet your expectations.",44.0,1,"1 Campaign

We hear you! The Min. width is shortened from 53 in to 49.2 in, compatible with a wider range of bathtub types.The grip is moved from the top to the middle, more convenient to pull out, even for your little ones.And you can see in the testing video that the watertight performance is not affected at all!

 
Thinking of giving your bathroom a makeover? Wondering how you can bring even a small bathroom to life? Tired of dealing with a moldy, dripping shower curtain?Traditional shower curtains are breeding grounds for mold and mildew, holding more bacteria than the average home’s toilet seat. And since they’re not waterproof, they often drip that bacteria-filled water onto your floor. Not to mention, they’re always dangling in your way and taking your valuable shower space.Meanwhile, glass shower stalls are bulky, take over your bathroom, and require a professional to install. And reports of cracks and breakages are common when not used carefully. ...And if you’ve looked into buying one recently, you’ll know they are definitely not cheap.Meet JoyFous, the new generation of waterproof rolling shower screen for 3 wall bathtubs that maximizes shower space while keeping your shower bacteria, mold, and mildew free. With its smooth roll-out design, the JoyFous seals you into your own shower world in one easy pull.Unlike bunchy, bulky shower curtains that crowd your shower space, the JoyFous follows one clean line from wall to wall. You simply pull out the JoyFous screen and attach the handle to the opposite wall. And when you’re not showering, the JoyFous is almost invisible. It fully retracts into its case in one smooth roll. Giving you back all the bathroom space you need for a clean, spacious bathroom. Without glass doors taking up space or wet curtains crowding the corner.  Once the JoyFous is pulled shut, you’re free to express yourself without worrying about a drop escaping. JoyFous creates a watertight seal that blocks water from escaping, even when you get carried away with the splashing, with a screen specially designed to withstand pressure even from powerful showerheads. Silicone sealing strips lining the JoyFous’s frame mean water won’t escape through the cracks and onto your walls and floor. What about regular shower curtains? They try to shield water from escaping, but they have no waterproof frame. The result? They hang loose, soak up spray, and wind-up dripping bacteria filled water onto your floor. Even glass shower doors tend to drip when you open them.And the JoyFous can stretch to fit any shower space. It runs from 53 to 78-inches, making it perfect for any three wall tub. Fact: You come to the shower to get clean.Fact: Studies show that in most homes, the shower curtain is the dirtiest thing in the bathroom, holding up to 60X more bacteria than the toilet seat. Are we the only ones who see a problem here?The JoyFous rolling shower screen uses three layers of mildew resistant material to block mold and mildew from forming even after years of use. Watertight silicone coatings on either side of the screen block water molecules while allowing air to flow in, making them mildew-resistant, waterproof, and dust-repellant. Meanwhile, the screen’s core middle layer is made of a fiberglass fabric treated with the same waterproofing process used on outdoor camping gear. And the JoyFous’s waterproof screen dries fast. So fast that it passed the rigorous SGS standard test for antibacterial materials, meaning you won't have to wait ages for it to dry before putting it away. Just roll it up right after your shower without mold or mildew creeping in between showers.Even the JoyFous’s aluminum-alloy frame is covered by a special plastic coating that keeps it mold and mildew free after repeated use.Call us crazy, but we think everyone deserves a clean place to shower. *Check the 30-day mold-proof test video below! We will proceed with the test until the end of the campaign!

 
 Small bathrooms, big bathrooms, skinny bathrooms, wide ones. Every bathroom is beautiful, and the JoyFous is designed to fit them all. The JoyFous is easy to install on your own, and unlike glass shower doors, you can do it without any help from a professional. It comes with two easy installation options to suit your bathroom set-up.No Fuss Glue Installation The easy glue installation is the perfect option to ensure a tight fit in any space — without damaging your wall. Simple & Secure Drill InstallationEven if your bathroom calls for an extra tight fit, the JoyFous’s simple drill installation option is completely DIY - you wont need any professionals to install it, unlike glass shower stalls. Just follow the simple guidelines to fasten the JoyFous securely into place for years of easy use.*Check complete installation videos (drill or glue) at the end of campaign page.  For the glue installation, no tools are required for a takedown. The JoyFous shower screen comes out as easily as it goes in. Planning to move? It is just as easy to uninstall and take with you when you relocate. Whether you’re renting downtown or leasing in the countryside, you can rest easy knowing the JoyFous won’t leave a trace.  Your shower is your oasis. Which means it should be safe, clean, and totally non-toxic.The JoyFous is made without any heavy metals, making it 100 percent skin friendly and safe for children. And it’s completely odor free! Making it safe for children to shower in.Plus, the JoyFous won’t get bent out of shape. It uses two layers of soft, durable silicone wrapped around flexible fiberglass that bounces back into shape, making it more durable than glass shower doors, and stronger than flimsy shower curtains. So it’s safe and clean for your whole family to use – from grandparents to grandkids. We’ve redefined durability in a shower, creating a new class of long-lasting shower screen that holds up under daily showers for years. Our engineers tested the JoyFous over 30,000 opens and retractions. They ran dozens of tests to create a screen that stays balanced and in-line after every pull. Ensuring an excellent watertight fit and a smooth opening — even after thousands of showers. So it works the same on day 1 as it does on day 1,000. *Check open & retraction test video below! That means saving you money in the long-run. With a 10-year plus lifespan, you’ll save big compared to expensive glass door installations that only last a fraction of the time. Or constantly replacing your hanging shower curtain when it gets moldy and breaks down.The JoyFous can be installed to open from right to left, or from left to right, depending on your shower position. To ensure the water-dam is effective, the main frame should always be installed on the same wall as your shower head, so that the screen pulls away from the shower to close.  Come Clean in All WhiteAll-white frame, handle, and shower screen for a clean look that suits any bathroom.A Bold Dash of BlackWhite shower screen with black frame and handle for a bold but subtle accent.                  Sign up on Kickbooster via the link below to get your personal referral link.

Time to start cleaning your home in 3D.</p><p>Most robot vacuum cleaners today are living in 2D. They only have a single sensor, so they fall short when scanning your home for slim objects.

And with a 520ml intelligent water tank for mopping hard surfaces, powerful suction capabilities, and a slim 3.35-inch body, the S10 can handle whatever mess your home throws at it. </p><p>And it never asks for a day off.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617077884/ayvo9k44dgqxkfaguzrp.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617104877/oyncaik70zgurgu4hngg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Nobody knows your home as well as you do.

Time to start cleaning your home in 3D.Most robot vacuum cleaners today are living in 2D. They only have a single sensor, so they fall short when scanning your home for slim objects. That leads to some messy mistakes - like dragging dog dirt around the house or getting caught under the sofa.Triple-eye LiDAR sensors put the S10 ahead of its class, allowing it to 3D scan your home in ways other cleaners can only dream of. It detects objects as slim as .04 inches, then decides in real-time to steer clear or hoover it up, ensuring a thorough clean without any surprises. Meanwhile, multi-floor mapping means the S10 can learn the layout of your home in seconds and optimize the most effective cleaning route. And with a 520ml intelligent water tank for mopping hard surfaces, powerful suction capabilities, and a slim 3.35-inch body, the S10 can handle whatever mess your home throws at it. And it never asks for a day off.Nobody knows your home as well as you do. Except for the 360 S10. The 3 powerful LiDAR sensors help the S10 size up your home and remove blind spots, meaning no more bumping into walls, and no problems. Just a clean home, every time.Main Laser The S10 keeps its eyes on the road. Its main laser focuses on long-distance objects and can detect items from 6-8 meters ahead, meaning it can spot your toddler crawling in the distance or the furniture you moved while remodeling.Front Laser The S10’s front laser has an eye for detail. It can size up objects in its path taller than 0.4 inches, then navigate away or rollover to hoover them up, helping it steer away from magazines on the floor and surprises from Fido. Wall LaserMind your head. The S10 uses a third laser to measure height, so it knows whether it can squeeze past or under obstacles - or if it should take a detour.Some messes are better left alone. The S10 is smart enough to know the difference.Most 2D cleaners come with a single LiDAR sensor that can only see and detect objects in 2D. And without a front or wall laser, they have blind spots when taking corners. That leads them to misjudge objects and bite off more than they can chew. The result? They wind up dragging your books around the house - or worse, charging through accidents from the family pet.The S10 uses 3D mapping to create a detailed blueprint of your home. Including your floor plan, furniture, and those slippers you left in the hallway. It memorizes your home’s floor plan and constantly scans for updates while cleaning. So you know your copy of Twilight or 32-page market report won’t be sucked up or rolled over.Your house is full of obstacles. And the S10 loves obstacles. Our engineers designed the S10 with a Front LiDAR sensor that can detect more than 100 different objects in your home. The results? Usage tests showed the 360 S10 to be 900 percent better at avoiding obstacles than the previous model. And they improved the S10’s 3D mapping accuracy by over 100 percent. So whether it’s a forgotten magazine or your cat missed the litter box, the S10 knows how to handle it.**The S10 360 can only detect objects taller than 0.4”, and may not be able to detect liquids.The S10 uses the same navigation technology as NASA’s Mars Rover to learn your entire home in seconds. Even those hard-to-reach corners you’d rather not think about. Its LiDAR sensors use a cutting-edge technology known as dToF - or Direct-Time-of-Flight - to shoot light pulses as it cleans your home. Compared to traditional LDS technology, the S10 offers 4X accuracy when recognizing objects, and 30% faster positioning. It can also handle areas with strong lightings, like balconies or the floor beside your sliding back doors - areas where other cleaners tend to get fuddled.Besides, the S10 never gets side-tracked while it’s cleaning. It uses an AI-powered algorithm (SLAM) to plan the most efficient cleaning route for your home, giving the clean you need in the shortest amount of time… without complaining about it.Remember the last time you had fun mopping a floor? Neither do we. The S10’s smart water tank makes cleaning even the toughest floor stains a hands-off experience. It adjusts the spray pressure depending on your floor’s surface. So it won’t over-soak the floors and damage them over time. And the mop will switch into high gear when it finds a tough floor stain. With an active pressure system that increases force when needed - no elbow grease required.And with a 520ml smart water tank - the largest of any robot vacuum on the market - it can handle up to 2153 ft² of flooring in one go. Add your favorite disinfectant to the water tank to kill floor bacteria and give you that clean home smell, and you’ll see why those wood-handle mops are so yesterday.Don’t let the S10’s slim design fool you - there’s a whole lot of power under the hood. It sucks up dirt and dust at a powerful 3300Pa. That’s around 1,000 Pascals more than the average robot cleaner. So its superior suction will dig in deep to clean the dirt you can’t see, while filtering dust in the process.And since no two messes are the same, the S10 comes with 4 different suction modes to fit your home's many moods and messes. So whether you’re drowning in dog hair or just want to cut down on cleaning time, you’ll find an option to suit your home.With all that power, the S10 never has to cut corners - but it will clean them. It’s powerful enough to suck up stubborn dirt tucked inside corners or up against the wall. Most robot vacuums don’t know the difference between your kitchen tiles and that shaggy rug in the living room. But cleaning those two surfaces requires a totally different approach.The S10 uses ultrasonic sensors to know what type of surface it’s on and changes its cleaning strategy. It can increase suction for thicker rugs, then lower power for slick tiles and hardwood. It will never get confused and mop your carpet either.We know. There’s no such thing as an ideal body type. Unless you’re a vacuum cleaner that needs to scoot under the sofa or get between chairs at the kitchen table - where it tends to get extra messy. Then it pays to be slim.That’s why our designers broke the mold by putting the S10’s LiDAR sensors inside the body, making the 360 S10 ultra-slim, and ahead of the curve. So there’s no bulky sensor bumping into your furniture.No more getting on your hands and knees to reach every nook and cranny. This breakthrough in robot cleaner design allows the S10 to stay at just 3.35-inches high, so it can go all the places your other vacuum cleaner can’t. Apologies to your… um, thicker vacuum cleaner. Living in a large home? The S10 doesn’t mind. It will still clean the entire thing and can memorize up to 10-floor maps at a time. So it remembers your home and cleans every room, every time, even when you’re living large. It can also recognize different floors and switch among the maps automatically.Some parts of your home are off-limits. Even to your vacuum cleaner.The S10 will only go where you say it can. Just program a no-go zone into the app, and the S10 will stay out of a kid’s bedroom during naptime or steer clear of the shelf where you keep grandma’s antiques. Have a complicated layout in your home? The S10 can adapt. While other robot cleaners only allow for regular areas to be set as no-go zones, the S10 will allow you to create multi-type shapes you like in the app.And no-go zones can be used for mopping features as well — the S10 is smart enough to avoid spraying your rugs. And no-go zones can be updated daily to keep up with the changes in your home. Some parts of your home need more attention than others. Like that spare room where your cat likes to nap. Simply program it into the app using the ‘Selected Room Cleaning’ feature, and the S10 will go over the area repeatedly until it gets the clean it needs.The 6 anti-drop sensors help it detect danger zones like ledges, staircases, and balconies, so you’ll never have to worry about it taking a tumble while it's off cleaning your home. Hate taking out the trash? The S10 makes it quick, clean, and easy with a washable 500ml capacity dust bin. It’s large enough that you’ll only have to empty it every two weeks. And one touch opening lets you toss the dirt without getting your hands dirty. Plus a mesh bin filter keeps long hairs from clogging it up.Working from home has its own special soundtrack: Phones ringing. Kids playing. Conference calls that last too long. Don’t let your vacuum cleaner be yet another background noise. Clocking in at a smooth 60 decibels, the S10 works hard without making a fuss about it. A 10-stage noise reduction system helps the S10 keep a low-profile even while it’s working overtime. So it makes cleaning your home sound easy… when you know that it’s anything but.And the S10’s patented noise-reduction system is pet-friendly. So it won’t set Fido on edge while making its rounds.The S10 makes it easy to have a customizable cleaning schedule. Simply program your most ideal cleaning time in the app - how’s Monday and Friday at 10 AM, when the house is empty? Or maybe 5 PM Thursday before your dinner guests arrive. Is once-weekly cleaning enough for your home, or do you have the kind of place that needs daily attention?Besides, the S10 will never give up just because it bumps into your yoga mat. It comes equipped with a cross-country chassis that enables it to crawl over obstacles up to 2cm high. Founded in 2005, 360 is known as a leading internet technology company providing security solutions for both enterprises and individuals, as well as technology-driven IoT products and solutions to bring online and offline solutions for people's daily lives. 360 Smart Life Group is a business group under the 360 brand that focuses on R&D and innovation of smart devices and IoT solutions.

This means that the sharpness is there to last. What's more, the sides of the knife is a flexible stainless steel enclosing this hard centre, making this knife even more harder and persistent.Finally the forged core has been created so that the structure of the metal and the durability is lengthened.＜Use of cobalt＞During the forging process of steel, carbon is lost, so cobalt is used to keep this lose to a minimum. By doing so, the steel can be forged to be of the highest quality. ＜Specifications＞[Knife] Cobalt Steel Alloy core with layered 13 Chrome Stainless Steel outer lining.[Handle] Reinforced laminate[Knife Edge] Double- edged (Usable for both left and right handed users)The ONE’S KNIFE is a great knife to have at home, and will be something you will reach for automatically when you go to cut after using it once.This blended knife mixing the best parts of a Japanese Nakiri and Chinese Cleaver is a great blade for any home that loves to cook, or even those that just need a multipurpose blade! We're offering the ONE'S KNIFE at 3 different discount levels, with 2 separate delivery dates due to the time it takes to manufacture. The first wave of orders will be sent in October　2021, with the second wave being sent in November 2021.Hokuriku Aluminium is an aluminium product manufacturer that has been running for the past 90 years or so, with it having its origins in producing cooking utensils. Since 1930, they have been producing high-quality aluminium cooking utensils, building materials and furniture etc., in the famous metalworking town of Takaoka in Toyama Prefecture.In December 2018, Hokuriku Aluminium was chosen as a regional future leader, by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.A regional future leader is selected on the virtue of being a company that creates products of high quality that also encompasses the characteristics of the region and helps to create an economic boom for the local economy.HP：https://hokua.com/This Project is promoted by Japankuru Funding, Bringing Japanese Products to the West!Points of consideration:Shipping Schedule: Due to the coronavirus, shipping from Japan has become rather erratic, and is takes a while to ship to various countries. We plan to ship via freighter ship, which will take 2-3 months from shipping. Import Fees: As we plan to send to various countries all over the world, we aren't able to handle the various import taxes, and therefore will need to be paid on the backers side. We ask for your understanding in this matter. Refunds: When the project has finished we aren't able to provide any refunds to backers. We ask for your understanding in this matter. Regarding Canadian Backers and Delivery: Currently shipping all over the world is in a state of flux, however shipping to Canada is extremely delayed from Japan due to a lack of open freighters heading there. We can't read the situation at the moment but we will ship as quickly as possible if the project is successful!",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","We are located in Western Oregon amidst an amazing array of natural materials. I have been chasing this dream full time for over two years and as a hobby for over a decade. Forming these materials for this purpose has been a challenging and inspiring experience. Along the way we've been covered by media sources including GIZMOTO, Details Magazine and Gear Junkie. 
Our technology has been impact and performance tested and we are actively selling custom helmets. For our next step, we need your help.Our objective is to fully certify the first lines of natural fiber bicycle helmets. We want to show that natural materials can work as well and better than the synthetics we are so accustomed to. Thus far, all of our prototypes have succeeded in preliminary testing at an accredited CPSC laboratory. We need your help to get 2 models fully certified for bicycle use.  See www.coyledesignandbuild.com for more info.
Prototype Testing at ACT Labs in CaliforniaOur helmets are made with salvaged wood and cork (which is sustainably harvested from live trees on a ~15 year cycle.)  This is the first time either of these materials have been used this way and we have patents pending for both technologies.  We use epoxy that is derived from tree resins and water based adhesives to keep our footprint small.

Outside our solar energy driven shop.Our helmets are 100% waterproof and weigh in at about 21 ounces.  The way we cut the cork allows air to circulate within the shell aiding venting and heat exchange. We have sold custom (non-certified) helmets to folks on 5 different continents and received inspiring feedback from our customers and businesses alike.Professional Mountain Biker Ryan Leech is a big supporter of our product!  Ryan Leech sporting his Madrone burl lid.All manufacturing and assembly is done in Oregon.  We are the only domestic manufacturer of bicycle helmets. To this point we have been able to develop our products successfully using leased and outsourced equipment and services. We will continue to offer fully custom helmets, AND we have chosen the following two models to take through the expensive process of certification: Holz Model Built with Fine Grain Douglas Fir, and the Madera Model Built with Fine Grain Douglas Fir.The certification process demands that we send large batches of each size and model.  Right now this is far more helmets than we are able to produce. To finish the comprehensive certification process and get our helmets out where folks can see them we need to have tools dedicated to our project in our shopWe will use funding to bring our manufacturing operation ""in house"".  This means buying one CNC Router for machining wood and a Laser cutting machine for cork (If you have some expertise in this area, we would love to hear from you).Machining one of our Douglas Fir ShellsA maple prototype being tested at the lab.To mark the significance of this project, we will burn ""1st Batch"" inside the helmets ordered through Indiegogo (and will burn your name in too, if you'd like). T shirts will have a limited edition “Team Member” text added.  Thanks for your support.-CoyleHERE ARE SOME OF THE PERKS: T-shirt with our logo.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Capable of baking up to 16"" pizzas</i></p>
<p>It's been 4 years since we ran our very first crowdfunding campaign which lead to the launch of <strong>Uuni: the world's first portable wood-fired oven</strong>. We're so grateful that campaign backers enabled us to bring our initial spark of an idea to market and we're proud to say Uuni is now in over 60 countries around the world and has received fantastic press, customer feedback as well as multiple awards. <strong>Uuni prioritises innovative design, ease of use, quality build and affordability</strong> and has opened up wood-fired cooking to a whole new global audience.</p>
<p>We are a company that has been built on connections and community and so it feels only right that we launch our next product here as a crowdfunding campaign: Say hello to Uuni Pro! </p>
<p>Uuni Pro has been over 2 years in the making. Our new Uuni Pro is a continuation of the innovative Uuni vision which offers game-changing versatility at a great price. Uuni Pro users will experience extreme cooking and versatility. Uuni Pro is quad fuelled which means it can run on wood pellets, larger pieces of wood, charcoal and gas- we are extremely excited about the capabilities of the Pro.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>It's all about that base</i></p>
<h3>What exactly is Uuni Pro</h3>
<p>Uuni Pro is not just a big Uuni, it's much, much more than that. First of all, its multi fuel capability enables you, the chef, to decide what you want to use to cook your food with. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Uuni Pro comes with the Wood + Charcoal Burner</strong> as a standard. As the name suggests, it's for burning regular wood as well as charcoal. We actually love using the Pro with charcoal to provide the main baseline of heat and then before a pizza goes in we throw on a few bits of wood to give the extra oomph and flavour.</li>
<li>The standard setup comes with our patent pending <strong>Pizza Door</strong>. This is a removable door that has an opening to get pizzas in and out easily. But being removable it's easy to take off if you want to put in a large piece of meat or bread. Or just want a better view of the flames.</li>
<li>As an Indiegogo special, backers of the campaign will receive the <strong>Uuni Pro Full Door</strong> as well as the our new <strong>Pellet Burner</strong> for a steady even heat.  The door, as seen in the photos, includes a window so you can see the food cooking and a thermometer to keep an eye on temperatures inside.</li>
<li>After the campaign we're also making available a <strong>Gas Burner</strong> for the Pro for $30 (a special price for campaign backers). The reason for not including it in the main reward is restriction imposed by certification requirements in different countries. E.g. we want to make sure we're allowed to sell in your country.</li>
<li>As with our previous Uuni models Uuni Pro takes fuel at the back of the oven and food goes into the front. The<strong> </strong>Wood + Charcoal Burner can be loaded from a hatch at the back. The Pellet Burner sits behind the unit and has a hopper of it's own. Details of the Gas Burner will be released soon. </li>
</ul>
<p>We've also gone back to the drawing broad to redesign what an Uuni looks like. The sleek new body hides inside it a layer of insulation to further enhance performance. Overall the body, with its stone baking board and door weighs around 57 lbs. (or 26 kg) making it transportable; it's easy to move to the back of your car or into your shed for safe keeping.</p>
<p><strong>Uuni Pro Size: </strong>Length: 29.13"" (740mm) Width: 19.29"" ( 490mm) Height: 31.1"" (790mm) </p>
<p><strong>Large cooking surface</strong>: 17.7 by 17.7"" (450mm by 450)</p>
<p>The majority of the body is made of high-grade 304 stainless steel to ensure it keeps it's beautiful appearance as long as possible and it isn't affected by the elements. (Please note the Uuni Pros featured in this campaign video and in the images are pre-production samples.)</p>
<p><strong>The planned retail price for the above setup of Uuni Pro is $649</strong>. By backing our campaign now on Indiegogo you'll not only save money but also make sure you're one of the very first people in the world to get to experience Uuni Pro.</p>
<p><strong>What's in the box:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Uuni Pro</li>
<li>Stone Baking Board (Removable)</li>
<li>Pizza Door</li>
<li>Wood + Charcoal Burner</li>
<li>Pellet Burner</li>
<li>Uuni Pro Full Door</li>
<li>Pizza Peel</li>
<li>(Backers of the Early Bird Perk also receive the Uuni Pro T-Shirt)</li>
</ul>
<p>Uuni care passionately about sustainability and as with our Uuni portable oven and wood-pellets <strong>we will plant a tree for each Uuni Pro we sell</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Free Shipping for US, UK</strong>. Other countries priced separately. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where are we now and why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>We have been working on Pro tirelessly for the past two years and needless to say we're super excited to be finally in the position to let the world know about it.</p>
<p>Starting in <strong>May 2016</strong>, we've been making prototypes with the chosen manufacturers (the same ones who also make our super popular Uuni 2S). They are very familiar with the product and have started now preparing tooling for manufacture. We've paid for this - a cost of around $50,000 - and it's progressing to plan. In <strong>January 2017</strong> we finished our patent application which means we're now ready to go public about Uuni Pro. We're doing final testing of units made with the tools in <strong>March/April</strong> and plan on starting manufacture of the parts at the same time. </p>
<p>We've invested heavily in this product - time, resources and money towards tooling - we now need your help so we can begin manufacturing at scale!</p>
<h3><b>Experience you can trust</b></h3>
</div><div><p>These last few years of experience in design, manufacturing, global logistics and fulfilling orders have been truly invaluable and we believe we are in a great position to make sure that this project is as smooth as possible. We have a fantastic and trusted relationship with each member of the chain- meaning that we are confident that we can deliver outstanding Uuni Pros to you this summer. </p></div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>If you're not ready for Uuni Pro just yet you still can help the campaign by letting your your friends know. Or even better- just think of that <i>one</i> friend who you think might just LOVE Uuni Pro and send them a link to this campaign. We'd really appreciate that.</p>
<p>We also have an exclusive Pro-backer T-shirt that'll just be available via this campaign.</p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</strong></p>

We knew we could create something bigger which enables users to create any dish in their oven. Breads, large meats, trays of roast vegetables and delicious 16” pizzas. The beauty of Uuni Pro is that it’s still transportable and that the multi-fuel capabilities truly mean it’s the most versatile oven out there. We’re proud to be further transforming the outdoor cooking landscape.”
Kristian Tapaninaho, Founder of Uuni
It's all about the food

Delicious rainbow trout with lemon & dill. First covered with foil, then finished on the open flames

It's time to level-up your bread skills


Here's the prime rib again, it was as good as it looks..

Uuni Pro provides the easiest and best pizza making experience. It really just takes 15 minutes to heat and you're ready to cook the tastiest pizzas you've ever had

It's all about that base
What exactly is Uuni Pro
Uuni Pro is not just a big Uuni, it's much, much more than that. First of all, its multi fuel capability enables you, the chef, to decide what you want to use to cook your food with. 


Uuni Pro comes with the Wood + Charcoal Burner as a standard. As the name suggests, it's for burning regular wood as well as charcoal. We actually love using the Pro with charcoal to provide the main baseline of heat and then before a pizza goes in we throw on a few bits of wood to give the extra oomph and flavour.
The standard setup comes with our patent pending Pizza Door. This is a removable door that has an opening to get pizzas in and out easily. But being removable it's easy to take off if you want to put in a large piece of meat or bread. Or just want a better view of the flames.
As an Indiegogo special, backers of the campaign will receive the Uuni Pro Full Door as well as the our new Pellet Burner for a steady even heat.  The door, as seen in the photos, includes a window so you can see the food cooking and a thermometer to keep an eye on temperatures inside.
After the campaign we're also making available a Gas Burner for the Pro for $30 (a special price for campaign backers). The reason for not including it in the main reward is restriction imposed by certification requirements in different countries. E.g. we want to make sure we're allowed to sell in your country.
As with our previous Uuni models Uuni Pro takes fuel at the back of the oven and food goes into the front. The Wood + Charcoal Burner can be loaded from a hatch at the back. The Pellet Burner sits behind the unit and has a hopper of it's own. Details of the Gas Burner will be released soon. 

We've also gone back to the drawing broad to redesign what an Uuni looks like. The sleek new body hides inside it a layer of insulation to further enhance performance. Overall the body, with its stone baking board and door weighs around 57 lbs. (or 26 kg) making it transportable; it's easy to move to the back of your car or into your shed for safe keeping.
Uuni Pro Size: Length: 29.13"" (740mm) Width: 19.29"" ( 490mm) Height: 31.1"" (790mm) 
Large cooking surface: 17.7 by 17.7"" (450mm by 450)
The majority of the body is made of high-grade 304 stainless steel to ensure it keeps it's beautiful appearance as long as possible and it isn't affected by the elements. (Please note the Uuni Pros featured in this campaign video and in the images are pre-production samples.)
The planned retail price for the above setup of Uuni Pro is $649. By backing our campaign now on Indiegogo you'll not only save money but also make sure you're one of the very first people in the world to get to experience Uuni Pro.
What's in the box:

Uuni Pro
Stone Baking Board (Removable)
Pizza Door
Wood + Charcoal Burner

Uuni care passionately about sustainability and as with our Uuni portable oven and wood-pellets we will plant a tree for each Uuni Pro we sell.
Free Shipping for US, UK. Other countries priced separately. 

Where are we now and why Indiegogo?
We have been working on Pro tirelessly for the past two years and needless to say we're super excited to be finally in the position to let the world know about it.
Starting in May 2016, we've been making prototypes with the chosen manufacturers (the same ones who also make our super popular Uuni 2S). They are very familiar with the product and have started now preparing tooling for manufacture. We've paid for this - a cost of around $50,000 - and it's progressing to plan. In January 2017 we finished our patent application which means we're now ready to go public about Uuni Pro. We're doing final testing of units made with the tools in March/April and plan on starting manufacture of the parts at the same time. 
We've invested heavily in this product - time, resources and money towards tooling - we now need your help so we can begin manufacturing at scale!
Experience you can trust
These last few years of experience in design, manufacturing, global logistics and fulfilling orders have been truly invaluable and we believe we are in a great position to make sure that this project is as smooth as possible. We have a fantastic and trusted relationship with each member of the chain- meaning that we are confident that we can deliver outstanding Uuni Pros to you this summer. 
Other ways you can help
If you're not ready for Uuni Pro just yet you still can help the campaign by letting your your friends know. Or even better- just think of that one friend who you think might just LOVE Uuni Pro and send them a link to this campaign. We'd really appreciate that.
We also have an exclusive Pro-backer T-shirt that'll just be available via this campaign.

Dear Supporters,

our goal was to create the best automatic self-cleaning litter box and make your life as a Cat Owner much easier by eliminating the smelly funk and daily hassle of litter box scooping.
 
This stinking problem pushed us to conceptual and hard work 
on solution of it. 
We created a reliable, comfortable and affordable Automatic self-cleaning litter box – our Smart Kitty.
 
Smart Kitty is adapted for all cats sizes and needs. To make it safe we have implemented sensors and our patented solutions.
Smart Kitty handle with waste of all sizes and scoops them to separated container, which stays closed while not used. It really works! It's efficient and requires only minimal attention.
Be sure that smell and your cat’s toilet things will not concern you anymore. 
Your cat will appreciate it very much. We are sure that you will LOVE IT too!
 

            
 Smart Kitty - The Best Invention Ever 

Absolute MUST HAVE for Cat Lovers.
 
 

 



 
 
 
 
 
 

























 


We have adapted Smart Kitty to all cats' sizes and needs. To make it safe we have implemented sensors and our patented solutions. Smart Kitty handle with waste of all sizes and scoops them to separated container, which stays closed while not used. 


This way you can be sure that smell and your cat’s toilet things will not concern you anymore. 


We have kept to a minimum your participation to operate the unit.

 
 
Smart Kitty starts working and makes its job only after your cat leaves it.
 
Since now, you don’t have to worry about emptying your cat's litter box when you leave town for few days nor you are going to take a weekend trip. 
You can be confident that Your cat will benefit from hygienically clean litter box.

 

The device is constructed of 3 independent modules, each of which can easily be removed.

Such a solution is convenient and very functional. It provides fast disassembly and makes easy cleaning. 

When you are back cleaning of Smart Kitty automatic litter box is now very simple. You just replace Replaceable Waste Bags.
 
 It is so easy as changing a kitchen garbage bag every few days or weeks. 

 
        


 

 
                       


 


 

 
 

       
A few minutes after use by cat litter box, automatic cleaning process starts. Raking system allows precise separation of impurities from the gravel.
After collecting litter container opens, and droppings are placed in a special closed container for excrements in the same time preventing the extraction of odors. This is done without losing the pure grit. 
Inside the container there is interchangeable disposable molding, providing comfort and cleanliness of the device.  
 
The only action that will be done from cat owner, is to eject a filled container of excrement (depends of amounts of cats nor its sizes – every few days/week).


 
 
 
         


We followed two ideas: FUNCTIONALITY and DESIGN. 
From now litter-box can be a decoration for your home.


We wanted that Smart Kitty - automatic litter box will no longer be associated only with impurities and has not been pushed to the farthest corner of your apartment. 
From now Smart Kitty is an element of interior design thanks to its design and quality.

<p>As our cats age, it’s common even for cats with no previous history of illness<br/>to develop health issues that can become life-threatening if undetected.

</div></div>","Introducing Color Health Technology

Gain peace of mind by being able to visually monitor your cat's health. Early detection of health issues can greatly reduce the time to recovery and potential complications for our cats, as well as significantly reducing the cost of their medical care.
As our cats age, it’s common even for cats with no previous history of illnessto develop health issues that can become life-threatening if undetected. With cats beingunable to tell us when something is wrong and their tendency to hide illness, our ColorHeath Technology provides you peace of mind knowing that Luuup Litter can alert you topotential health problems between checkups.
 

Meet the no mess litter box that's clean in seconds
 
The Luuup Cat Litter Box system uses 3 identical sifting trays. Each tray acts as a sieve, but when any two are stacked together, they form a solid base. To clean the litter box, just lift the top tray & the waste is separated from the clean litter. Rotate the empty 180 degrees and place it at the bottom of the stack to create a perpetually sifting Luuup.
Cleaning your litter box takes seconds. Say goodbye to scoops and liners. No more wasting litter or buying expensive and complicated contraptions with parts that can break, that you still have to clean. The Luuup Litter Box maintains a simplicity of design and a build quality that ensures years of reliable use.

electronics, was organizing an elegant dinner on his terrace for his fiancée.
He needed some music to create the right mood, but he realized that his traditional
bluetooth speaker wasn't appropriate for the occasion:</span><br/></p><p></p><ol>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">It was made in plastic, so totally out of place for an
elegant dinner</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">It was out of power, and h</span>e couldn’t charge it on the terrace without troublesome and long
wires</li>
</ol><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Since that night, Gianluca started to think to a functional, elegant, wireless
and plastic-less audio speaker.</span><br/>Looking at the candle, an old notion from engineering school came to his mind: the “Peltier
effect”.<br/>
After 18 months of tests in his basement, the first rudimentary prototype
of Pelty, the first Bluetooth speaker powered by fire, was born.<br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/652576/files/20140616071126-IMG_7519.jpg?1402927886"" src="""" style=""width: 487.5px; height: 325px;""/></h3><p></p><br/><p></p><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">What We Did So Far...</span></h3><h4>

prototype assembled by Gianluca, we decided to set up a small company in Italy
and we self-financed the registration of the patent.</span><br/>
</h4>
<p>Also, we covered the costs to improve the engineering
and the design of the Pelty, making it as powerful and elegant we could,
keeping in mind our goal of a very simple, functional device. </p>
<p>The prototyping phase took 6 months, as
we had to face several issues with suppliers and improve Pelty’s efficiency.</p>
<p>We also self-financed the videos and pictures you see above (damn.. that's expensive!) for the Indiegogo campaign.</p><p><br/></p><h3><span style="""">...And Why We Need Your Support!</span></h3><h4></h4><p>We now need funds to get the project going.</p><p>The largest share of your donation will be used to rent a space where Pelty will be assembled and prepared for shipping.</p><p>Moreover, further R&amp;D activity is needed: improvements in materials used and optimization of the components will be pursued, in order to improve Pelty’s performances.</p><p>You will also help us find an optimal packaging, that must be both safe and environment-friendly (we don't want to use any polluting material).</p><p>Besides that, thanks to your support, we will be able to participate to a startup fair here in Italy, to show the first prototypes of Pelty to a crowd of journalists and other interested people.

The technological heart of Pelty is the TEG (Thermo Electric Generator), also

century, discovered the physical principle according to which electric energy
passing through two metals generates a difference in heat (and viceversa, a difference in temperature generates electricity).<br/><b>
The secret of Pelty, however, lies in the engineering of its components</b>. The

just a very high difference of temperature is able to generate enough electric
power to turn the speaker on. The space inside the Pelty and its components are
designed to maximize this difference in temperature.<br/>
Everything is positioned inside the ceramic vase accordingly, thanks to wood
and ceramic frames. The external glass is also engineered to maximize the power
generated by the TEG, because several holes let fresh air get into the system

in the high-quality audio speakers’ market: it is the first Bluetooth speaker
literally POWERED BY FIRE!Yes, that's true! Pelty works transforming the thermal energy generated by the heat of a candle into the electric energy necessary to power-up the speakers, with an excellent audio quality!Please read our story and  follow us on Facebook! Sharing Pelty with your friends would be a huge help for us!And please check for new videos on YouTube!Here's the power you get with Pelty! 96db .. comparable to any other speaker in commerce!!
Referral Campaign
We are running a referral campaign! Tell your friends!Pelty's StoryIn the summer 2012 Gianluca, an Italian engineer with a passion for
electronics, was organizing an elegant dinner on his terrace for his fiancée.
He needed some music to create the right mood, but he realized that his traditional
bluetooth speaker wasn't appropriate for the occasion:

It was made in plastic, so totally out of place for an
elegant dinner


It was out of power, and he couldn’t charge it on the terrace without troublesome and long
wires
Since that night, Gianluca started to think to a functional, elegant, wireless
and plastic-less audio speaker.Looking at the candle, an old notion from engineering school came to his mind: the “Peltier
effect”.
After 18 months of tests in his basement, the first rudimentary prototype
of Pelty, the first Bluetooth speaker powered by fire, was born.What We Did So Far...
After the first, very basic
prototype assembled by Gianluca, we decided to set up a small company in Italy
and we self-financed the registration of the patent.

Also, we covered the costs to improve the engineering
and the design of the Pelty, making it as powerful and elegant we could,
keeping in mind our goal of a very simple, functional device. 
The prototyping phase took 6 months, as
we had to face several issues with suppliers and improve Pelty’s efficiency.
We also self-financed the videos and pictures you see above (damn.. that's expensive!) for the Indiegogo campaign....And Why We Need Your Support!We now need funds to get the project going.The largest share of your donation will be used to rent a space where Pelty will be assembled and prepared for shipping.Moreover, further R&D activity is needed: improvements in materials used and optimization of the components will be pursued, in order to improve Pelty’s performances.You will also help us find an optimal packaging, that must be both safe and environment-friendly (we don't want to use any polluting material).Besides that, thanks to your support, we will be able to participate to a startup fair here in Italy, to show the first prototypes of Pelty to a crowd of journalists and other interested people. And eventually, organize some more events!Finally, we need funds to make further tests on prototypes and get CE certification (you will get updates on how tests go).SO PLEASE SUPPORT US BY PRE-ORDERING YOUR PELTY. FeaturesPELTY's Audio Quality is GOOOOOD!Listen to Adele with Pelty!Pelty is a solid, well engineered, premium quality device. The speaker is one of the most reliable in the market, and will last as long as any other speaker you know.Candle = Power. Pelty works with almost every candle. You will get instructions on how to place the candle and what is the minimum size of the candle to be used, but that's pretty much it! With the right candle, Pelty's loudness it totally comparable to any other bluetooth speaker!A candle lasts up to 5 hours, but Pelty can work as long as you want.Loudness of Your Pelty is already comparable to any other docking station! But we want to improve it to give you the best audio quality possible, please help us by supporting the project!The speaker data:- Full Range 3''- nominal impedance 8 Ohm- Nominal Power Handling 12 W rms - Resonant Frequenct: 125 Hz; This is the current prototype Frequency Curve,ElegancePelty is an elegant device with a refined taste addressing all the people willing to stand out from the idea that technology needs batteries, wires and an electrical plug.It’s designed for music-lovers willing to have an excellent audio quality and for design-lovers willing to be surrounded by original devices. Pelty is very easy to be used. Place the lit candle, wait a few seconds, and it is ready to connect to any Bluetooth device, like smartphones and tablets, from which the customer can easily change track and set the volume.Pelty works very well. It is perfect to listen to your music at home or outdoor, creating the right environment for your moments of relax and leisure.    Eco-friendly and Hand-Made in ItalyThe world is invaded by digital music and technological devices for music playback, such as wireless speakers; however they are cold digital devices, usually made by metal and plastic.They are very far from what the music has always represented: feelings and emotions, to live in intimacy or to share with the group.The fire in a brazier or the flame of a candle has always warmed the body and soul of people, making them think, discuss, pray, laugh and dream.This is the revolutionary aspect of Pelty: it combines these two elements, the magic of the flame and the poetry of music, since the latter is generated by the energy of the first.Moreover, only natural materials are used: ceramic, glass and wood.. premium quality materials that make Pelty an elegant, precious device! (no cheap plastic here!)Ceramic, in particular, is used on the one hand because of its resistance to heat and the excellent acoustic and insulation properties and on the other hand because it’s an elegant and natural premium quality material that perfectly matches the concept of Pelty. Ceramic is hand-made in Italy, as well as the glass,

Design, colours and personalizationsPelty is an object with unique, minimalist and elegant design, for every ambient.It is available in the following colours:With the Personalized Pelty perk you will have the opportunity to write Your name or a short sentence on the ceramic!We will contact you via email for colors and personalizations!Watch and share our 30seconds teaser!Where Can You Use It?Pelty can be used everywhere a candle can be lit; from your city flat to a lake cottage, from a beach to a mountain chalet. At home, it will amaze your friends, and create romantic atmospheres with your partner!        It perfectly fits restaurants with a romantic and classy ambient, allowing clients to listen to their own music; it’s also perfect for design hotels, SPAs and wellness centers.Cool! ..but..

<p><strong><em>Campaign summary</em></strong>...</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise support for a project to launch the Robokiller Kit. Specifically, it will be to create photos and instructions for a kit made from largely laser-cut mdf parts. </p>
<p>The present <em>Robokiller</em> prototype components shown (green low density polyethylene) have been handmade using adhesive design templates. These are stuck on to the polyethylene boards and the user then cuts out the  outline and drills the holes etc.  This has worked really well, but it is quite time-consuming and you need a band saw (or similar). This campaign is to launch the <em>Robokiller</em> kit with laser cut mdf parts. These are of course ready-cut and it speeds the whole process up (and the need for a more comprehensively kitted out workshop is reduced).</p>
<p>You can see brief notes and photos on the Robokiller website (<a href=""http://www.robokiller.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.robokiller.co.uk</a>). There is a lot of general data on that site, although it is is still under construction (and the focus is on the polyethylene version).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Kit or not a kit..?</strong></em></p>
<p>This is not a ready-to-assemble kit. A quick definition of 'kit' in this case: An assembly of detailed instructions and materials where many of the parts have to be made or at least finished off. The philisophy behind it is that making things yourself is fun!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Design aims</strong></em>...</p>
<p>The first design aim was was to create dinosaur-like mechanical creatures that really can fight (not just move and sing etc). We have been working on this for quite a while.</p>
<p>The second aim was to devise a kit that could be made by anyone with a reasonable set of tools and with basic workshop skills. I have tried to keep the costs to a minimum. </p>
<p> </p>
<em><strong>Future upgrade kits</strong></em>...<br/><p>We are continuously developing our ideas and products, but the basic kit as shown here will remain the same (except for small improvements here and there).  Several follow-up kits are planned, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>RC conversion kit (dispensing with the 3m umbilical)</li>
<li>'Target's: one <em>Robokiller</em> will be able to tear off chunks of the other and in so doing cause an injury.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Progress to date...<br/></em></strong></p>
<p>The present design can be made from a commercial cutting board (low density polyethylene) plus some adhesive templates.</p>
We have developed the adhesive templates so that it is not necessary to do any complex marking out - you simply peel them off, stick them on, cut out the parts and then drill the holes.

<p><em><strong>Materials...</strong></em></p>
<p>The materials are really easy to work with and the drill is powerful, cheap, and has a rechargable battery, a gearbox and a safety clutch.</p>
<p>However, cutting out the main body components does require having a band saw to hand (or being very good with a hand-held jig-saw). As mentioned above, it is quite time-consuming.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this campaign we are offering laser cut parts (mdf). This is also a very nice material to work with. There will be three colours to choose from: red, green or natural. Here are the parts cut out...</p>

<li>Finalise instructions for MDF version</li>
<li>Print instructions (B/W)</li>
<li>Assemble each kit</li>

<p> </p></div>","Robokiller Project Summary
My name is Ian Coker. I have been running an R&D company in the UK since 2000 (PES Ltd, www.workingmodel.co.uk).
I would like to present the Robokiller project.
(All photos by Nadia Coker; videos by Helena and Nadia Coker; video compilation by Helena Coker; CAD drawings by Adrian White; green prototype by Nadia Coker).
 

 
This is a (prototype) fighting robot dinosaur kit. (Please see the Gallery for more examples of Robokillers fighting -additional videos).
It crawls and bites with a unique lunging action...and you are the brain.
 

 
Essentially, this project is about making a fighting robot dinosaur from a kit using basic workshop tools and skills. We need your support to make the kit a reality.
 
Campaign summary...
This campaign is to raise support for a project to launch the Robokiller Kit. Specifically, it will be to create photos and instructions for a kit made from largely laser-cut mdf parts. 
The present Robokiller prototype components shown (green low density polyethylene) have been handmade using adhesive design templates. These are stuck on to the polyethylene boards and the user then cuts out the  outline and drills the holes etc.  This has worked really well, but it is quite time-consuming and you need a band saw (or similar). This campaign is to launch the Robokiller kit with laser cut mdf parts. These are of course ready-cut and it speeds the whole process up (and the need for a more comprehensively kitted out workshop is reduced).
You can see brief notes and photos on the Robokiller website (www.robokiller.co.uk). There is a lot of general data on that site, although it is is still under construction (and the focus is on the polyethylene version).
 
Kit or not a kit..?
This is not a ready-to-assemble kit. A quick definition of 'kit' in this case: An assembly of detailed instructions and materials where many of the parts have to be made or at least finished off. The philisophy behind it is that making things yourself is fun!
 
 
 
Design aims...
The first design aim was was to create dinosaur-like mechanical creatures that really can fight (not just move and sing etc). We have been working on this for quite a while.
The second aim was to devise a kit that could be made by anyone with a reasonable set of tools and with basic workshop skills. I have tried to keep the costs to a minimum. 
 
Future upgrade kits...We are continuously developing our ideas and products, but the basic kit as shown here will remain the same (except for small improvements here and there).  Several follow-up kits are planned, such as:

RC conversion kit (dispensing with the 3m umbilical)
'Target's: one Robokiller will be able to tear off chunks of the other and in so doing cause an injury.

 
Progress to date...
The present design can be made from a commercial cutting board (low density polyethylene) plus some adhesive templates.
We have developed the adhesive templates so that it is not necessary to do any complex marking out - you simply peel them off, stick them on, cut out the parts and then drill the holes.
 
  
 
Once all the parts are cut out it will look like this.....
 

 
These are then assembled as shown below (nb: motors, gearboxes, controller etc are not shown).
 

 

 
 
 

 
(With thanks to Adrian White for the CAD drawings).
These are then coupled to the components from a cordless drill (...plus a few other parts!).
 

Materials...
The materials are really easy to work with and the drill is powerful, cheap, and has a rechargable battery, a gearbox and a safety clutch.
However, cutting out the main body components does require having a band saw to hand (or being very good with a hand-held jig-saw). As mentioned above, it is quite time-consuming.
Therefore, in this campaign we are offering laser cut parts (mdf). This is also a very nice material to work with. There will be three colours to choose from: red, green or natural. Here are the parts cut out...
 

 
Below is the kit layed out (nb: control parts not shown). This does look a little like a fossil dinosaur we think!
 

 
(More can be seen on the website, www.robokiller.co.uk).


Control...

Removing the motor and gearbox/clutch of the cordless drill leaves the empty casing, which is a handy solution for a 'control console'. This is wired up to fire the lunging/biting action and it incorporates two slider switches for steering.
The device links to the Robokiller via a 3m umbilical cable.
 

 
....The user 'fires' the head/neck by squeezing the trigger. This causes the motor to rotate. The crank then drives the lunging and biting action.
 
   
 
Steering is simple skid-steer, like that used for a tank. You just use one switch for the left claws and one for the right claws. The two slider switches have forward-stop-reverse positions. This permits forward, back, left and right movements plus a few variations. 
Control is usually mastered within about 30 seconds!
 
Sophisticated bio-electronics...
The most sophisticated control device in existence controls it: your brain! So no electronics are needed.
Most importantly, the user does not need to select from a menu of instructions. This allows for completely instantaneous, intuitive control..
 
Safety
Please note: this is not a toy: don't allow children to attempt to make or use this unsupervised.
Please be sensible. (See the safety instructions on the website: http://www.robokiller.co.uk/index.aspx?pageid=9...).
The safety clutch is useful to protect the user and should prevent serious injuries, but keep fingers away from the two meshing gears shown above (yellow and red). The forces involved are considerable!
It is necessary to make up coverings to prevent accidents as part of the project (full instructions will be given).
 
Terms and conditions
Don't use this for commercial purposes please.
You will receive detailed instructions plus materials to make a prototype robot dinosaur, not a product, so please manage accordingly!
We are not reselling the cordless drill as such, but rather, when you make a donation, you are commissioning PES Ltd to buy the tool on your behalf and to disassemble it to provide the components. 
(& please see the note on cordless drill under 'kit in more detail' further below).
 


What We Need & What You Get
We need (support)...

A useful lump sum of money(!) to finalise the detailed instructions and for costs of materials etc.
Feedback on the usefulness of the instructions
Photos and videos of Robokillers in action

 
What you will get...

A kit
Detailed instructions
Email based assistance (for at least 6 months -then we'll see how it goes!)

Perks...
To keep things simple we are just offering 2 'main' perks: a kit for UK users and a kit for users in the USA.
(Anyone outside these two countries should buy the UK kit and ask how to pay the additional postage to their own country.)
We are also offering a small $25 perk, which consists of regular updates, a mention on our website and a Robokiller T-shirt (design to be finalised). NB: this is UK only. Perk to follow soon for US citizens (29th June)

(NB: minor changes possible according to availability of parts etc).
 
The cordless drill.
 
This is disassembled as shown (nb: charger included but not shown). We do this for you before sending, because it requires a special-purpose tool to remove the chuck.
 
 

 
The set of laser cut parts 
 

 
Four leg motors/gearboxes

  



Rods and tubes set
 
    
 
Electrical components set
 
     
 
Fasteners set

What we are planning for this campaign & project in more detail...
Funding
We need US$4383 to cover the costs of:

Laser-cutting the parts
Finalising the kit
Finalising the instructions
Postage

 
Postage & packing will be charged separately:
Pickup:                   Free postage (but £2.59 for the box!)
UK:                        £13 (US$ 20)
Europe:                  €(contact us)
US and Canada:      £50 (US$75)
R.O.W                    $(contact us)
 
The present set of instructions is geared towards the low density polyethylene version and we need to include pages (with a full set of photographs) for the laser cut parts.
In other words the campaign will hopefully provide funds to finance the following project...
Objectives

Finalise parts lists
Create mdf version photos and instruction manual

 
Activities
 

Build (complete) MDF sample version & take photos of this process
Commission supplier to laser cut the mdf parts in bulk
Purchase bulk supply of other components
Finalise instructions for MDF version
Print instructions (B/W)
Assemble each kit

If we don't reach the goal we can still continue as long as we cover the minimum cost for the laser cutting.
 
Value
People don't make things themselves as much as they used to!
People talk about the value of creativity and expression to quality of life, but this is usually realised in terms of music, art and so on but less and less in terms of making things in a workshop (except maybe DIY)...The arts are great, but so is making something that works...

<h3>We believe in <u>simplicity and modularity</u> - just Plug'n'Make</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>That's why we invented the Plug'n'Make system, so you don't have to bother with soldering or wiring. You can also forget about problems with mixing various power sources such as batteries and USB at the same time. BigClown takes care of this automatically thanks to its smart power management.</p>

The following block concept gives a better idea what are the most elementary pieces of the BigClown puzzle.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516133642/uuhhulbub6njfewm2jte.png"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2>Design Decisions</h2><p> </p><p>We believe in doing things the right way, so we have taken the following design decisions…</p><p> </p><h3>Decision #1: Radio Frequency</h3><p> </p><p>We use the 868/915 MHz frequency for radio communication. This is a license-free band designated for short signal messages. Abusing your IoT devices with a 2.4 GHz band and fighting streaming WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and other protocols will not help your system reliability. It is also about basic rules from physics - with higher frequency, you get worse penetration through the walls and other obstacles. Also, the power consumption efficiency is better at a lower frequency. And low-power designs are our goal!</p><p> </p><h3>Decision #2: Programming Language</h3><p> </p><p>Most developers have somewhat biased opinions about their favorite programming language and we fully hear those. However, in the embedded world if you want to get most from your platform that has to run for several years without a restart and with the lowest possible power consumption, you have to stick with the tools that simply satisfy such requirements.</p><p>That’s why we have chosen the C language as the programming language for the firmware development. With a solid, battle-tested GCC toolchain and traditional Makefile-based build, your projects will be secured for the future.</p><p>Despite the fact how much tempting it might be to use a high-level interpreted language like Python, Javascript, etc., you will always do worse in terms of consumed resources and execution time, than with a well-written code in C.</p><p>On the other hand, we have created a framework - <a href=""http://sdk.bigclown.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a firmware SDK</a> - that makes your own firmware development easy and working with the API feels like working in a high-level language.</p><p> </p><h3>Decision #3: Asynchronous Architecture</h3><p> </p><p>We have taken some really innovative technique to embedded level - the most notable one is asynchronous-like programming pattern. The built-in scheduler simplifies your life with tasks and platform’s power management - it is done for you automatically and you focus on the application development rather than low-level internals.</p><p>Also on the hub side, the MQTT follow asynchronous concepts as well. That’s a great opportunity to design your own IoT system in one, uniform, asynchronous concept.</p><p> </p><h3>Decision #4: CLI-First Approach</h3><p> </p><p>Command Line Interface (CLI) is the first class citizen in the BigClown system. This is where we differ from most other embedded IoT platforms. We emphasize CLI approach in the very first place. It has plenty of advantages - first of all, you can do all the operations on the so-called “headless” machines - like servers, embedded computers, etc. Secondly, you can easily hook up continuous integration services that can automate your workflow.</p><p>Moreover, tied with Git, MQTT client tools, logging mechanism, etc. you will quickly see that your workflow is rather smooth and efficient.</p><p> </p><h2>Hardware Design</h2><p> </p><p>Modular hardware is the essence of the BigClown IoT Kit. We put a lot of efforts into the quality of our products. That’s why we source all the components from the official distributors and manufacture all our products locally, in Europe.</p><p>However, the product quality is not just about experience with the sourcing and manufacturing processes, but it all starts with a proper engineering design. We spend an endless amount of hours on proper component selection, peer-reviewed schematic design and precise PCB routing that does not only contribute to the overall product reliability but also looks beautiful.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516133800/pb8bpvn3tucctki0nytl.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Firmware Development</h2><p> </p><p>BigClown currently offers 3 firmware programmable units - Core Module (part of every node), USB Dongle (works as a gateway) and Cloony (miniaturized version of the Core Module for SMT assembling). All firmware projects share two things: microcontroller STM32L083CZ from STMicroelectronics and BigClown SDK (stands for the Software Development Kit). This SDK provides code re-use and accelerates firmware development.</p><p>We stick to these principles while working on the SDK development:</p><ul>
<li>Consistent and clean API design</li>
<li>Modular and object-oriented approach</li>
<li>Event-driven, asynchronous programming</li>
<li>Well-named functions, data types, variables, etc.</li>
<li>No barriers to access low level peripherals</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Example application code for LED an button using the BigClown SDK:</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516205182/lhropkmxpoovylaezdv2.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>To your project, the SDK is integrated as a Git submodule. This has one advantage - your firmware can be “linked and locked” to a specific version of the SDK. This makes sure that it will be possible to compile your firmware at any time in the future. But if you need to, the SDK can be updated to the most recent version by simple make update command.</p><p>Today, the BigClown SDK wraps more than 50 entities and all the APIs are documented using Doxygen.</p><p> </p><h2>Firmware Build</h2><p> </p><p>We follow the traditional KISS (Keep It Small and Simple) principles. That’s why we use GNU Make build system altogether with the GCC ARM Embedded compiler toolchain. We provide pre-built firmware images for the reference projects, but you can also clone the source GitHub repository and build the firmware on your own…</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://storage.googleapis.com/bigclown-campaign/firmware-build.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Firmware Upload</h2><p> </p><p>Firmware workflow feels so much smooth using the BigClown Firmware Tool (bcf) - a handy CLI tool written in Python. You can use it not just for the firmware uploads, but also to manipulate firmware images from the public GitHub repositories.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://storage.googleapis.com/bigclown-campaign/firmware-upload.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>MQTT in Heart</h2><p> </p><p>There is an ocean of options in the world of communication standards and it may feel difficult to pick the right one. However, in the world of IoT, there is one dominant option - MQTT protocol. BigClown builds on top of MQTT asynchronous messaging. Because of its wide binding offering, you can start interacting with the BigClown hardware in the programming language of your choice.

It doesn't matter who you are and what your profession is. It doesn't matter if your project is for your home, garden, office or school.
 


 
... and follow the maker's golden circle.
 

 
 

 

 
We believe in simplicity and modularity - just Plug'n'Make
 
That's why we invented the Plug'n'Make system, so you don't have to bother with soldering or wiring. You can also forget about problems with mixing various power sources such as batteries and USB at the same time. BigClown takes care of this automatically thanks to its smart power management.
  
 
The future is wireless, as BigClown is
 
We use a sub-GHz radio technology, which provides a longer range, lower power consumption, and better coexistence than both WiFi and Bluetooth. The installation of wireless devices built on BigClown is fast and straightforward. For instance, the motion detector snapping on the lamp, as shown in the video.
 

 
Two or more years on batteries, that's what we do
 
We simply love designing low-power devices - one of the greatest strengths of our ecosystem. All the hardware components are carefully picked to accomplish this job. Your devices will run reliably on standard Alkaline batteries for years!

 
Colorful enclosures which just slide on
 
BigClown comes with a whole range of colorful enclosures printed on the famous open-source 3D printer Prusa i3. Just pick your color that best fits your style and mood. You can also download our 3D models and print them on your own if you like.
 

 
With our superior support and docs, you won't be left behind
 
We are constantly evolving our system of documentation and tutorials to keep things clear, simple and straightforward. If you come across an issue or suggestion, we are here to help!
 
 

 
 

Open-source is our passion, and we share it
 
We share everything that we do with you - no black box, no back doors, no hidden catches, and always open to your finest tweaks. This concept makes integrations with other devices or services of your preference a whole lot easier!
 

 
After 2 years of hard work, we have more than 30 hardware products in stock. And more are in the pipeline - what an amazing pace! Our commitment, to keep expanding the portfolio, is endless.
 

 
 

 
This is a high-level concept of the BigClown IoT Kit in the picture. You can find more detailed information in the Geek's Zone at the end of this pitch. It is up to you to decide whether you connect your devices to a cloud service, or if you prefer to do their job offline.
 


 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


 
 


 

 

 

 
 



 
 





 
 Block Concept Building your IoT projects is like assembling a puzzle from many pieces. The following block concept gives a better idea what are the most elementary pieces of the BigClown puzzle.  Design Decisions We believe in doing things the right way, so we have taken the following design decisions… Decision #1: Radio Frequency We use the 868/915 MHz frequency for radio communication. This is a license-free band designated for short signal messages. Abusing your IoT devices with a 2.4 GHz band and fighting streaming WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and other protocols will not help your system reliability. It is also about basic rules from physics - with higher frequency, you get worse penetration through the walls and other obstacles. Also, the power consumption efficiency is better at a lower frequency. And low-power designs are our goal! Decision #2: Programming Language Most developers have somewhat biased opinions about their favorite programming language and we fully hear those. However, in the embedded world if you want to get most from your platform that has to run for several years without a restart and with the lowest possible power consumption, you have to stick with the tools that simply satisfy such requirements.That’s why we have chosen the C language as the programming language for the firmware development. With a solid, battle-tested GCC toolchain and traditional Makefile-based build, your projects will be secured for the future.Despite the fact how much tempting it might be to use a high-level interpreted language like Python, Javascript, etc., you will always do worse in terms of consumed resources and execution time, than with a well-written code in C.On the other hand, we have created a framework - a firmware SDK - that makes your own firmware development easy and working with the API feels like working in a high-level language. Decision #3: Asynchronous Architecture We have taken some really innovative technique to embedded level - the most notable one is asynchronous-like programming pattern. The built-in scheduler simplifies your life with tasks and platform’s power management - it is done for you automatically and you focus on the application development rather than low-level internals.Also on the hub side, the MQTT follow asynchronous concepts as well. That’s a great opportunity to design your own IoT system in one, uniform, asynchronous concept. Decision #4: CLI-First Approach Command Line Interface (CLI) is the first class citizen in the BigClown system. This is where we differ from most other embedded IoT platforms. We emphasize CLI approach in the very first place. It has plenty of advantages - first of all, you can do all the operations on the so-called “headless” machines - like servers, embedded computers, etc. Secondly, you can easily hook up continuous integration services that can automate your workflow.Moreover, tied with Git, MQTT client tools, logging mechanism, etc. you will quickly see that your workflow is rather smooth and efficient. Hardware Design Modular hardware is the essence of the BigClown IoT Kit. We put a lot of efforts into the quality of our products. That’s why we source all the components from the official distributors and manufacture all our products locally, in Europe.However, the product quality is not just about experience with the sourcing and manufacturing processes, but it all starts with a proper engineering design. We spend an endless amount of hours on proper component selection, peer-reviewed schematic design and precise PCB routing that does not only contribute to the overall product reliability but also looks beautiful.  Firmware Development BigClown currently offers 3 firmware programmable units - Core Module (part of every node), USB Dongle (works as a gateway) and Cloony (miniaturized version of the Core Module for SMT assembling). All firmware projects share two things: microcontroller STM32L083CZ from STMicroelectronics and BigClown SDK (stands for the Software Development Kit). This SDK provides code re-use and accelerates firmware development.We stick to these principles while working on the SDK development:
Consistent and clean API design
Modular and object-oriented approach
Event-driven, asynchronous programming
Well-named functions, data types, variables, etc.
No barriers to access low level peripherals
 Example application code for LED an button using the BigClown SDK:  To your project, the SDK is integrated as a Git submodule. This has one advantage - your firmware can be “linked and locked” to a specific version of the SDK. This makes sure that it will be possible to compile your firmware at any time in the future. But if you need to, the SDK can be updated to the most recent version by simple make update command.Today, the BigClown SDK wraps more than 50 entities and all the APIs are documented using Doxygen. Firmware Build We follow the traditional KISS (Keep It Small and Simple) principles. That’s why we use GNU Make build system altogether with the GCC ARM Embedded compiler toolchain. We provide pre-built firmware images for the reference projects, but you can also clone the source GitHub repository and build the firmware on your own…  Firmware Upload Firmware workflow feels so much smooth using the BigClown Firmware Tool (bcf) - a handy CLI tool written in Python. You can use it not just for the firmware uploads, but also to manipulate firmware images from the public GitHub repositories.  MQTT in Heart There is an ocean of options in the world of communication standards and it may feel difficult to pick the right one. However, in the world of IoT, there is one dominant option - MQTT protocol. BigClown builds on top of MQTT asynchronous messaging. Because of its wide binding offering, you can start interacting with the BigClown hardware in the programming language of your choice. Or start with the simple CLI tools…   Backing us is just the beginning of our bond. We care about you and your success with the BigClown IoT Kit.

Some like them short and cold and others have more elaborate routines.
In either case we think you deserve a reward at the end.
Preferably one that's velvety-soft, large enough to wrap around your body and doesn't smell of mold.
 

 
Living in Egypt we came to appreciate the level of precise craftsmanship and high quality of the materials used in linens. Noticing that the local linen products are a cut above and beyond anything else we’ve seen or touched. 
 

 
Fueled by our passion (and aggravation) we began our journey of research and discovery. We found hundreds of variations of the same towel but none that checked off all the boxes. 
So we decided that we'd go straight to the source and do it ourselves.
 

 

 

We decided to keep the design functional and simple. The silky-soft velour on one side reverses to a pleasantly exfoliating and super absorbent underside. Giving you the best of both worlds.
 
By combining century-old practices with modern-day engineering we created the towel that keeps you dry and stays dry.  
 
A wet towel = mold and bacteria growth 
A dry towel = healthy towel
 

You will notice a remarkable difference in how fast the towels dry themselves. A dry towel means it is not vulnerable to bacteria and so it stays clean. 
 
 


 
At Casamera we believe that better basics should come from quality materials. That's why we focus on one naturally remarkable fabric: long-staple Egyptian cotton.

<p>The blades in our blender are highly engineered to be at a precise 8-degree ratio, making the blending process more efficient. The blades are made from carbon steel, adding greater durability and strength. Each blade is assembled with both a blunt and sharp side.

<p>The compact design makes OdaKitchen Smoothie Pro easier to store. No need for a large countertop or a cupboard room. The base of OdaKitchen Smoothie<br/>Pro is smaller while being much more stable than those of the competitors’. The motor base and the blade system are connected by a zinc alloy die-casting structure which ensures the stability of the blender while working. A smaller base also makes it lighter. Moving it around on your countertop or putting it in your cabinet is no longer a difficult task.</p>

Unlike other homemade smoothies made with a regular blender, the smoothie you made doesn’t come out a goopy and chunky mess. With OdaKitchen Smoothie Pro, you will make a smooth-as-silk smoothie that tastes like the creamy indulgent milkshakes of your childhood.How? Technology!
 

 


 
The powerful motors of OdaKitchen Smoothie Pro, with an unrivaled high speed of 39, 000 RPM, spin in a fast-and-slow pattern to reach maximum blending efficiency.  Built with full copper wires and a thickened rotor, our motor offers a longer lifespan and lower noise level.  
 

 

 

                                   
The blades in our blender are highly engineered to be at a precise 8-degree ratio, making the blending process more efficient. The blades are made from carbon steel, adding greater durability and strength. Each blade is assembled with both a blunt and sharp side. The blunt side hits the ingredients powerfully while the sharp side cuts precisely when rotating rapidly.  
 

 
                 
                               
 
Our square-designed pitcher creates a unique controlled vortex, automatically pulling the ingredients back to the blades for faster, smoother blends.
 

 

 
A zinc alloy die-casting structure was used to connect the blade to the motor base. Unlike other products that use regular metal for this part, zinc alloy helps to balance the whole blender while keeping the base socket less heavy.
 
 



 

 
 
            

 

 

 
With programmed settings, you can make your favorite smoothie with ease. Pile in the ingredients and press the start button, and your healthy smoothie is done in less than one minute.
 

 

 
OdaKitchen Smoothie Pro can do much more than just make smoothies! Making juices, ice cream, nut butter, baby food, salsa, hot soups….you name it. The picture above shows a full list of the programmed setting on the OdaKitchen Smoothie Pro. Choose from those if you are a beginner, or, use the manual option to adjust the speed to get the precise texture you want.
 

 
                              
 
Say goodbye to the goopy, sticky residues. OdaKitchen Smoothie Pro’s pitcher is easy to clean. Add warm water and drop some dish soap and press the pulse button for 20 seconds. Rinse well after this and you will have a clean pitcher. The pitcher is also dishwasher safe, so, you can just throw it into the dishwasher when you are busy.
 

 

 
                               
 
The compact design makes OdaKitchen Smoothie Pro easier to store. No need for a large countertop or a cupboard room. The base of OdaKitchen SmoothiePro is smaller while being much more stable than those of the competitors’. The motor base and the blade system are connected by a zinc alloy die-casting structure which ensures the stability of the blender while working. A smaller base also makes it lighter. Moving it around on your countertop or putting it in your cabinet is no longer a difficult task.
 
            
 

 

     

Detect and protect. These functions are designed to guarantee your safe experience with our blenders.
    


 
Our pitcher is made of BPA-free Tritan, which is engineered to be better than glass, stainless and any other plastic. They are safe, light, and durable. It’s also dishwasher safe, so it’s easier to clean.*Please note that the seal ring of the pitcher may turn yellow because it is made of natural food grade rubber. Cleaning immediately after each use will help avoid this.

</h3>
<p><i><b>Life is not about how long you live.  It is about the Memories you create. </b></i><br/></p>
<p>Hi!  My name is Brenda DuPont, and I have been an ""innkeeper"" in my heart for over 20 years. With your help, I am hoping that it can become a reality. Most of my story is  on <a href=""http://www.thepondhouseatflowingsprings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thepondhouseatflowingsprings.com</a> . The full story of where I started and what I need to do next.  Please also check out the Gallery for pictures of the property.</p>
<p>I have been grooming the property for over 10 years. Using all my resources to get it to the point of my retirement and starting what I have always wanted to do. <br/></p>
<p>BE an INNKEEPER!<br/></p>
<p>At one time, I had the equity in my home to build my dream. Then, you guessed it.  The<i> BIG RECESSION OF 2009</i>.  Now my mortgage company tells me I owe more than my property is worth......but I can not get them to come out and look at it, or all the improvements that I have made. They say I am ""upside down"" in my value......but I know that is  <i>NOT TRUE!  <br/></i></p>
<p><i>This property is so unique</i>....that they just do not have anything to compare it to. I have been told that by appraisers. They just flat do not have anything in the immediate area to use as comps. <br/></p>
<p> I have been told by realtors that it should appraise between 610K and 1 Million. It all seems to boil down to ""accountability"". <i>No</i> <i>one wants to put themselves on the line.</i> With out the ""<i>comps</i>"" they just won't do it. So, they appraise it as if it is just an ordinary house. They do not take into consideration that it has an acre and a half SPRING FED POND....AND all the WATER RIGHTS. They do not consider the pond at all. It is as if EVERY home in AZ has their own lake.....big deal!  Have you been to Arizona?  Do you have a lake?  <i>I just want to kick them!</i><br/></p>
<p> <b>I am not going anywhere.....so I can wait it out. ......but what can't is my dream</b>.  <br/></p>
<p>Please check out my website so I do not repeat myself.  <a href=""http://www.thepondhouseatflowingsprings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thepondhouseatflowingsprings.com</a><br/></p>
<p>My fondest memories have always been wrapped around children, family,vacations, relaxation and the people you meet that inspire you. I guess you can say that now that I am older, my new hobby is making happy memories.  And I have some I would like to share with you.</p>
<p>This is Miss Alice.  Alice does not live here on earth anymore, but when she was with us.........the Pond house was her ""happy place"".  She did not win the third battle she fought with cancer, but at 90 years old...<i>""she sure gave 'em hell""</i> (her words). This seems like a sad memory to you, perhaps, but to see her smile was a special one for us.  Alice died shortly after her last visit. Alice was not family, but I would have been honored to call her so.  She was as tough as nails....and as sweet as pie.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/945909/files/20141020133103-DSC01350.JPG?1413837063"" src="""" style=""width: 619.783px; height: 464px;""/></p>
<p>Alice taught me how to be patient....and grateful for every day that I was given in this life. She taught me how to say ""Thank You"".....and mean it!  And Thankful I am.<br/></p>
<p>She never complained, and always had a sparkle in her eye. Her ""memory"" stories were amazing.  She once owned a lodge herself....way more ""rustic"" than mine will ever be and some of her guest were quite famous.  Hers was a hunting lodge back east.<br/></p>
<p> A fun quirk of hers was that she had been keeping this special ivy going that she had brought from her home land alive for over 71 years, and passing it on to those she loved.  I guess you could not buy it here, so to her it was very special. She had a summer home in Pinetop Arizona, and she would take it up there in the summer, and keep it in Phoenix in the winter.  I have had several pots of it going for several years now.  I move it inside in the winter...and outside in the summer, because up here....it really does not get that hot, and I have not forgotten to ""share it"" with those who I love. A few months ago I almost lost it.........I went away for about a week.....and forgot to have it watered.  That would have been heartbreaking to me, as I could not have replaced it. Turns out the plant is as ""hardy"" as Alice herself. With water and pruning..... it came back!  As beautiful as ever!  I can not remember the name of it.......................................... </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/946142/files/20141020150306-DSC01656.JPG?1413842586"" src="""" style=""width: 368px; height: 276px;""/>  So.....we just call it ALICE.<br/></p>
<p>More memories of Alice: <br/></p>
<p>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/946089/files/20141020143727-DSC01370.JPG?1413841047"" src="""" style=""width: 314.667px; height: 236px;""/>     She was quite the fisherman!  <br/></p>This is Alice with Max and Maynard. Maynard had one brown eye and one blue eye.<br/><br/><p>            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/946100/files/20141020144449-DSC01346.JPG?1413841489"" src="""" style=""width: 523.668px; height: 393px;""/></p>
<br/><p><b>Alice also taught me to go for it!</b>  She said not to wait too long......<i>""dreams have a</i> <i>way of fading away""</i> she would say, <i>""Age might have something to do with it.........don't get old and regret it!    LIFE was meant to LIVE.......LIVE IT GIRL!""</i>               I can hear her voice just like yesterday.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me <b><i>because she is right!  </i></b>I am letting this slip away because of the ECONOMY. Because the banks are still not lending, and property values are still down.  I just turned 64 years old in September.  I  AM getting older and I need to do this now. I have been grooming the property for over ten years. I have the perfect location....the experience..........and the DESIRE.</p>
<p>Because of the economy.........I just do not have the money to get it started. That is why I am ASKING for your support. The banking community is still too raw to make these kind of loans.   <br/></p>
<p>Payson is a small town of 25,000 people, including Pine and Strawberry. We are building a satellite Arizona State University which will create a 6000 student campus. The town is growing. According to the Chamber of Commerce, it plans to grow to 38,000.....just Payson proper.  There is a need for quality lodging and jobs. The town is one of the few in Arizona that has the water to grow.  It has solved its water woes with the building of the Blue Ridge Pipeline.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the growth going on here, the Payson Chamber of Commerce has a  site  you can visit for everything you need to know about Payson Arizona. It is <a href=""http://www.rimcountrychamber.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rimcountrychamber.com</a>.<br/></p>
<p>With your contributions and support, I can get the Pond House Bed and Breakfast open and running....in time for this growth.  I am strong, healthy and still young.  I am very vested in this project, both emotionally and financially. By taking the steps to  fulfill my life long dream now, I am also grasping  the opportunity to be apart of this perfect timing.  And (a perk for me).  Alice would be proud of me for ""kicking out the coward"".  <b>I am GOING for it!</b> <b>(Alice)</b>  <br/></p>
<p>Please help me in this start up phase!  <br/></p>
<p>Gratefully yours,</p>
<p>Brenda</p>

<h4><b><i>We just can't wait to meet you in person!</i></b></h4>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>My Vision and your Impact</h3>
<p>The Pond House at Flowing Springs will be more than just a typical Bed and Breakfast. It has a unique ""Southern Plantation"" feel, and country setting with the East Verde River on one side and backed up against National Forest on the other. It will be the first resort type bed and breakfast in the area, yet only 6 miles from Payson and 9 miles from Pine, AZ.  Both are rich in western history, antique shops, museums and art galleries. Pine is ALIVE on weekends. There is always something going on in that little town! Also, the FAMOUS Tonto Natural Bridge is between us and Pine. For hikers....it is a must. Strawberry, AZ is only 3 mile UP the hill (about 500 feet higher) and Don't blink.  Very quaint...and from there you can take Fossil Creek Road to the turquoise pools and travertine waterfalls of Fossil Creek. </p>
<p>Here is a drawing I did of it once for my Christmas Cards of the Fossil Creek Bridge.<br/></p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/960735/files/20141026122804-Fossil_Creek_Bridge.jpg?1414351684"" src="""" style=""""/>Fossil Creek is a 14-mile perennial stream in central Arizona's high desert region, fed by the warm artesian waters of Fossil Springs. A local rancher looking for a water source for his cattle discovered it in the late 1880's.  Now it is a favorite swimming hole.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>We will offer relaxing, enjoyable lodging coupled with outdoor activities. This is a Bed and Breakfast that includes breakfast for 2 people with the use of the property.  With several different activities available guests can choose from hiking trails, boats on the pond, fishing in the pond, the hot-tub, the sauna, the game room, free movie checkout, the use of the common areas for relaxing and watching television, the library where there are multiple books to borrow, the internet hookup with work stations, and every night take advantage of a complimentary salad and soup bar in the dining room.</p>
<p>Guest can choose to purchase food ""setups"" to grill on their own at night to accommodate the soup and salad. These setups will be sold in the main dining room and will consist of a potato, rice or a vegetable with either fish, meat, pork or chicken. These will be packaged so the guest can do their own grilling at the gas grills located next to the dining room or patios. If you don't feel like going out to one of Payson's many restaurants in the evening or forget to bring your own steaks....we've got ya' covered. And reasonably priced too.<br/></p>
<p>The Pond House at Flowing Springs will cater to the business traveler, the university parents coming to check out the school, vacationers looking for the tranquility of the country and the beauty of the land and animals yet seeking the pampering that only comes from a quality bed and breakfast. There is no urban life here, although the availability to connect to the outside world, when necessary, is available.</p>
<p>The Pond House at Flowing Springs will be the only ""resort"" type bed and breakfast in Payson with multiple services all available at one location. Some of these services will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiking trails on the property, and out into the National Forest from the property.</li>
<li>Private Lake on the property.</li>
<li>Fishing on the property that requires no special license (private land).</li>
<li>Quad and Argo rentals from the property.</li>
<li>Private tours from the property with guides.</li>
<li>Internet stations with free satellite service.</li>
<li>Soup and Salad served at night, with the option of guest purchasing set ups to complete meal.</li>
<li>The property is adjacent to the East Verde River and Weber Creek.</li>
<li>This is an Indian artifacts area.</li>
<li>Use of paddle boats, fishing boats and canoes.</li>
<li>Fresh eggs and organic fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li>Comfortable home away from home.</li>
<li>Nothing.....just setting on the many patio's and watching the day go by, or finding a hammock and reading.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be able to accommodate those looking to host weddings, graduation parties, family reunions, as well as business and church retreats</p>
<p>One primary goal is to increase the lodging options in the growing Payson area, which will increase employment opportunities in career fields such as reservations, sales, landscaping, yard maintenance, cleaning and maid services, repairs and maintenance, cooks, servers, and guides just to name a few for the local community and the surrounding areas..<br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Most of the risks I have already taken.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>I own the property. It is a reality, not a vision. I am not asking you to help me purchase it.  <br/>
</li>
<li>I have already purchased the two lots behind me for growth and to be a completely contained area.</li>
<li>I have groomed the property and the pond to the point of building</li>
<li>I have built and remodeled most of the buildings and patios.</li>
<li>I have cut in all the hiking trails, </li>
<li>I have the furnishings for all the rooms. (except the fireplaces).<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>With any Project there are always Challenges.</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Small business is the driving force in the economy and no
population has been more successful at it than private entrepreneurs. The LOVE of what you are doing  IS the DRIVING FORCE.<br/></p>
<p>I have stayed in 96 Bed and Breakfasts, and have been employed in the Travel industry both as a Travel Agent and a Travel Agency Owner.</p>
<p>I have extensive experience in marketing and running a business.</p>
<p>I have the personality and likability required to be an Innkeeper<br/></p>
<p>I have gone through training programs and understand the work and the risks involved in Owning a Bed and Breakfast.</p>

<ul><li>I am a member of the Professional Association of Innkeepers, and stay informed of what is going on in the industry.  <br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>I know that more people are traveling within the United States, and the ""Home Stay"" industry is thriving.  </li></ul>
<ul><li>More business travelers are going into these types of accommodations, that is why the ""Hotels"" are tagging themselves as ""Bed and Breakfasts"" resorts.<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>The mortgage is paid by me now.....so that is not a risk. It is not an added expense........but the property will generate an ADDED INCOME.</li></ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>YOUR BIGGEST RISK WITH ME:  <br/>
</h3>
<h3>Can I Cook?<br/>
</h3>
<b>YES!</b>  I am an excellent cook (if I say so myself).  I have a reputation among those that know me of being a ""gourmet"" cook.  <br/><br/><b>My daughter-in-law said it best: </b> <br/><i>""our resume may look better on paper than yours........but you are probably the</i> <i>better cook""</i>   Michelle has been Kitchen Manager of several major and well know restaurant chains.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving is coming ......so I would like to share one of my ""signature"" recipes with you. This is one that is requested every year.<br/><br/><b>CREAMY WILD RICE SOUP</b><br/>3/4 Cup uncooked wild rice, rinsed and drained<br/>2 Tablespoons powered instant chicken bouillon<br/>3 Tablespoons Butter<br/>2 Cups sliced mushrooms <br/>1/2 Cup sliced celery<br/>1/2 Cup chopped onion<br/>1/3 Cup flour ( all purpose)<br/>1/4 Teaspoon ground pepper<br/>4 Slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled<br/>2 cups half and half or light cream<br/>3 tablespoons dry sherry<br/><br/>In a large saucepan over high heat combine 3 cups hot water, wild rice and 1 teaspoon of chicken bouillon.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce to low, cover and simmer for 45 minutes (or until rice is tender BUT NOT mushy).  Drain.<br/><br/>In a Dutch Oven over medium heat, melt butter.  Cook mushrooms, celery and onion in hot butter until tender, ( about 5 to 7 minutes).  <br/><br/>Add Flour.  Cook and stir until light brown. ( In the South we call this a rue).<br/><br/>Gradually add 4 cups hot water, remaining 5 teaspoons bouillon and pepper.<br/><br/>Cook and stir until smooth.  Bring mixture to a Boil.  Add Rice.  Reduce to low and cover.  Simmer for 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Add half and half, bacon and sherry.  Cook until heated through DO NOT BOIL!<br/><br/>Serve hot .......and ENJOY!<br/><br/>

Life is not about how long you live.  It is about the Memories you create. 
Hi!  My name is Brenda DuPont, and I have been an ""innkeeper"" in my heart for over 20 years. With your help, I am hoping that it can become a reality. Most of my story is  on www.thepondhouseatflowingsprings.com . The full story of where I started and what I need to do next.  Please also check out the Gallery for pictures of the property.
I have been grooming the property for over 10 years. Using all my resources to get it to the point of my retirement and starting what I have always wanted to do. 
BE an INNKEEPER!
At one time, I had the equity in my home to build my dream. Then, you guessed it.  The BIG RECESSION OF 2009.  Now my mortgage company tells me I owe more than my property is worth......but I can not get them to come out and look at it, or all the improvements that I have made. They say I am ""upside down"" in my value......but I know that is  NOT TRUE!  
This property is so unique....that they just do not have anything to compare it to. I have been told that by appraisers. They just flat do not have anything in the immediate area to use as comps. 
 I have been told by realtors that it should appraise between 610K and 1 Million. It all seems to boil down to ""accountability"". No one wants to put themselves on the line. With out the ""comps"" they just won't do it. So, they appraise it as if it is just an ordinary house. They do not take into consideration that it has an acre and a half SPRING FED POND....AND all the WATER RIGHTS. They do not consider the pond at all. It is as if EVERY home in AZ has their own lake.....big deal!  Have you been to Arizona?  Do you have a lake?  I just want to kick them!
 I am not going anywhere.....so I can wait it out. ......but what can't is my dream.  
Please check out my website so I do not repeat myself.  www.thepondhouseatflowingsprings.com
My fondest memories have always been wrapped around children, family,vacations, relaxation and the people you meet that inspire you. I guess you can say that now that I am older, my new hobby is making happy memories.  And I have some I would like to share with you.
This is Miss Alice.  Alice does not live here on earth anymore, but when she was with us.........the Pond house was her ""happy place"".  She did not win the third battle she fought with cancer, but at 90 years old...""she sure gave 'em hell"" (her words). This seems like a sad memory to you, perhaps, but to see her smile was a special one for us.  Alice died shortly after her last visit. Alice was not family, but I would have been honored to call her so.  She was as tough as nails....and as sweet as pie.

Alice taught me how to be patient....and grateful for every day that I was given in this life. She taught me how to say ""Thank You"".....and mean it!  And Thankful I am.
She never complained, and always had a sparkle in her eye. Her ""memory"" stories were amazing.  She once owned a lodge herself....way more ""rustic"" than mine will ever be and some of her guest were quite famous.  Hers was a hunting lodge back east.
 A fun quirk of hers was that she had been keeping this special ivy going that she had brought from her home land alive for over 71 years, and passing it on to those she loved.  I guess you could not buy it here, so to her it was very special. She had a summer home in Pinetop Arizona, and she would take it up there in the summer, and keep it in Phoenix in the winter.  I have had several pots of it going for several years now.  I move it inside in the winter...and outside in the summer, because up here....it really does not get that hot, and I have not forgotten to ""share it"" with those who I love. A few months ago I almost lost it.........I went away for about a week.....and forgot to have it watered.  That would have been heartbreaking to me, as I could not have replaced it. Turns out the plant is as ""hardy"" as Alice herself. With water and pruning..... it came back!  As beautiful as ever!  I can not remember the name of it.......................................... 

  So.....we just call it ALICE.
More memories of Alice: 
                       She was quite the fisherman!  This is Alice with Max and Maynard. Maynard had one brown eye and one blue eye.            
Alice also taught me to go for it!  She said not to wait too long......""dreams have a way of fading away"" she would say, ""Age might have something to do with it.........don't get old and regret it!    LIFE was meant to LIVE.......LIVE IT GIRL!""               I can hear her voice just like yesterday.
This campaign is important to me because she is right!  I am letting this slip away because of the ECONOMY. Because the banks are still not lending, and property values are still down.  I just turned 64 years old in September.  I  AM getting older and I need to do this now. I have been grooming the property for over ten years. I have the perfect location....the experience..........and the DESIRE.
Because of the economy.........I just do not have the money to get it started. That is why I am ASKING for your support. The banking community is still too raw to make these kind of loans.   
Payson is a small town of 25,000 people, including Pine and Strawberry. We are building a satellite Arizona State University which will create a 6000 student campus. The town is growing. According to the Chamber of Commerce, it plans to grow to 38,000.....just Payson proper.  There is a need for quality lodging and jobs. The town is one of the few in Arizona that has the water to grow.  It has solved its water woes with the building of the Blue Ridge Pipeline.

If you would like to learn more about the growth going on here, the Payson Chamber of Commerce has a  site  you can visit for everything you need to know about Payson Arizona. It is www.rimcountrychamber.com.
With your contributions and support, I can get the Pond House Bed and Breakfast open and running....in time for this growth.  I am strong, healthy and still young.  I am very vested in this project, both emotionally and financially. By taking the steps to  fulfill my life long dream now, I am also grasping  the opportunity to be apart of this perfect timing.  And (a perk for me).  Alice would be proud of me for ""kicking out the coward"".  I am GOING for it! (Alice)  
Please help me in this start up phase!  
Gratefully yours,
Brenda

And we don't care when you stay.......as long as we are open and the rooms are available.
We just can't wait to meet you in person!

My Vision and your Impact
The Pond House at Flowing Springs will be more than just a typical Bed and Breakfast. It has a unique ""Southern Plantation"" feel, and country setting with the East Verde River on one side and backed up against National Forest on the other. It will be the first resort type bed and breakfast in the area, yet only 6 miles from Payson and 9 miles from Pine, AZ.  Both are rich in western history, antique shops, museums and art galleries. Pine is ALIVE on weekends. There is always something going on in that little town! Also, the FAMOUS Tonto Natural Bridge is between us and Pine. For hikers....it is a must. Strawberry, AZ is only 3 mile UP the hill (about 500 feet higher) and Don't blink.  Very quaint...and from there you can take Fossil Creek Road to the turquoise pools and travertine waterfalls of Fossil Creek. 
Here is a drawing I did of it once for my Christmas Cards of the Fossil Creek Bridge.



Fossil Creek is a 14-mile perennial stream in central Arizona's high desert region, fed by the warm artesian waters of Fossil Springs. A local rancher looking for a water source for his cattle discovered it in the late 1880's.  Now it is a favorite swimming hole.


We will offer relaxing, enjoyable lodging coupled with outdoor activities. This is a Bed and Breakfast that includes breakfast for 2 people with the use of the property.  With several different activities available guests can choose from hiking trails, boats on the pond, fishing in the pond, the hot-tub, the sauna, the game room, free movie checkout, the use of the common areas for relaxing and watching television, the library where there are multiple books to borrow, the internet hookup with work stations, and every night take advantage of a complimentary salad and soup bar in the dining room.
Guest can choose to purchase food ""setups"" to grill on their own at night to accommodate the soup and salad. These setups will be sold in the main dining room and will consist of a potato, rice or a vegetable with either fish, meat, pork or chicken. These will be packaged so the guest can do their own grilling at the gas grills located next to the dining room or patios. If you don't feel like going out to one of Payson's many restaurants in the evening or forget to bring your own steaks....we've got ya' covered. And reasonably priced too.
The Pond House at Flowing Springs will cater to the business traveler, the university parents coming to check out the school, vacationers looking for the tranquility of the country and the beauty of the land and animals yet seeking the pampering that only comes from a quality bed and breakfast. There is no urban life here, although the availability to connect to the outside world, when necessary, is available.
The Pond House at Flowing Springs will be the only ""resort"" type bed and breakfast in Payson with multiple services all available at one location. Some of these services will include:

Hiking trails on the property, and out into the National Forest from the property.
Private Lake on the property.
Fishing on the property that requires no special license (private land).
Quad and Argo rentals from the property.
Private tours from the property with guides.
Internet stations with free satellite service.
Soup and Salad served at night, with the option of guest purchasing set ups to complete meal.
The property is adjacent to the East Verde River and Weber Creek.
This is an Indian artifacts area.
Use of paddle boats, fishing boats and canoes.
Fresh eggs and organic fruits and vegetables.
Comfortable home away from home.
Nothing.....just setting on the many patio's and watching the day go by, or finding a hammock and reading.


We will be able to accommodate those looking to host weddings, graduation parties, family reunions, as well as business and church retreats
One primary goal is to increase the lodging options in the growing Payson area, which will increase employment opportunities in career fields such as reservations, sales, landscaping, yard maintenance, cleaning and maid services, repairs and maintenance, cooks, servers, and guides just to name a few for the local community and the surrounding areas..
Reasons To Support Us:


Your support will make some pretty awesome things happen.
The biggest IMPACT will be to STOP THE PAIN of waiting to finish the creation of a dream.

experiences.

Help create local and rural jobs.

Because you enjoy discovering different and unique locations and exploring unique
destinations, you get to pay it forward by helping to create one.

You will always be a part of us. 

You have a NEW place to call home.



  Risks & Challenges
Most of the risks I have already taken.

I own the property. It is a reality, not a vision. I am not asking you to help me purchase it.  

I have already purchased the two lots behind me for growth and to be a completely contained area.
I have groomed the property and the pond to the point of building
I have built and remodeled most of the buildings and patios.
I have cut in all the hiking trails, 
I have the furnishings for all the rooms. (except the fireplaces).


With any Project there are always Challenges.


Small business is the driving force in the economy and no
population has been more successful at it than private entrepreneurs. The LOVE of what you are doing  IS the DRIVING FORCE.
I have stayed in 96 Bed and Breakfasts, and have been employed in the Travel industry both as a Travel Agent and a Travel Agency Owner.
I have extensive experience in marketing and running a business.
I have the personality and likability required to be an Innkeeper
I have gone through training programs and understand the work and the risks involved in Owning a Bed and Breakfast.


I am a member of the Professional Association of Innkeepers, and stay informed of what is going on in the industry.  

I know that more people are traveling within the United States, and the ""Home Stay"" industry is thriving.  
More business travelers are going into these types of accommodations, that is why the ""Hotels"" are tagging themselves as ""Bed and Breakfasts"" resorts.

The mortgage is paid by me now.....so that is not a risk. It is not an added expense........but the property will generate an ADDED INCOME.

YOUR BIGGEST RISK WITH ME:  

Can I Cook?

YES!  I am an excellent cook (if I say so myself).  I have a reputation among those that know me of being a ""gourmet"" cook.  My daughter-in-law said it best:  ""our resume may look better on paper than yours........but you are probably the better cook""   Michelle has been Kitchen Manager of several major and well know restaurant chains.Thanksgiving is coming ......so I would like to share one of my ""signature"" recipes with you. This is one that is requested every year.CREAMY WILD RICE SOUP3/4 Cup uncooked wild rice, rinsed and drained2 Tablespoons powered instant chicken bouillon3 Tablespoons Butter2 Cups sliced mushrooms 1/2 Cup sliced celery1/2 Cup chopped onion1/3 Cup flour ( all purpose)1/4 Teaspoon ground pepper4 Slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled2 cups half and half or light cream3 tablespoons dry sherryIn a large saucepan over high heat combine 3 cups hot water, wild rice and 1 teaspoon of chicken bouillon.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce to low, cover and simmer for 45 minutes (or until rice is tender BUT NOT mushy).  Drain.In a Dutch Oven over medium heat, melt butter.  Cook mushrooms, celery and onion in hot butter until tender, ( about 5 to 7 minutes).  Add Flour.  Cook and stir until light brown.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Yoki is an egg boiler - egg's best friend! <br/></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Yoki boils eggs safely, efficiently and really, REALLY cute-ly, the three ingredients that we think all egg boilers should have. Yoki was recently featured on Simon Mayo's Drive Time show <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">on the BBC</span>, and now we want to make the following even bigger by making Yoki the first crowd funded egg boiler. In addition to a very strong following of Yoki fans, we have a network of manufacturers, distributors and marketing people to <strong>help us to make the first 5000 Yokis</strong>, which is what this campaign is about; and helping to start a new, ‘good gadget’ revolution - you see Yoki isn't just a gadget. Yoki is a 'good gadget', something that does good in the world. It makes boiled eggs which are good for you, and it does so in a way that makes you want to use it again and again; which makes you want to feed yourself good things again and again, and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">that HAS to be good!</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To us Yoki's always been a member of the family. We'd like to see a Yoki in every home one day, brightening up breakfasts all across the world. We’d like to make Yoki a member of your family, but MOST of all, we'd like to know that it came about <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">with help from you</span>. All we need now is you... <br/> </p>
<p><strong>So what does Yoki do?<br/></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">You fill Yoki with water (about a mug full), dial in a time and pop an egg on top. Yoki heats up the water, lowers the egg, counts down the timer you set at the start and then raises the boiled egg back out again; a beautiful process to watch, a most beautiful egg snack to eat, and much safer than trying to pick an egg out of a boiling hot saucepan with a spoon. Each of the hats you can see in the video is an egg cup - just lift off the top - and Yoki's very environmentally friendly too, using a fraction of the energy needed by even the smallest saucepan. Safe, efficient and really, really cute; that's what Yokis are!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<h3>A Great Opportunity </h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is a real opportunity that doesn't come around very often; to be part of helping to bring a great new product to market, and we'd like to involve as many people as possible. There's so much talk about getting good food inside our bodies at the moment which is exactly what Yoki is designed to do.  We hope Yoki will help to start a 'good gadget revolution', and we'd like as many people to be a part of that as possible<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>. Here's to gadgets that 'do good'! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make 5000 Yokis we need $150000, which sounds like a lot but here's where it goes. Firstly we need to make injection moulds to make Yoki suitable for mass production and that takes up about $50000, and the rest will be used to make the units themselves, packaged and shipped to the UK  - approximately $20 per unit. </p>
<p><strong>The first thing that every campaign contributor gets to do is decide what the first Yokis off the production line will look like.</strong> We want you to belong to Yoki’s future so what better way than to help decide what he looks like? </p>
<p>All contributors will also get limited edition cool Yoki stickers and a mini (very cute)Thank You Card, signed by Yoki's inventor, and with it your 'First Yoki' entry form. <span> </span></p>
<p>For 'next stage up' contributors we're giving discounts on the first 5000 Yokis you've helped to create, limited edition Yoki prints as well as an invite to the YOKI LAUNCH PARTY. Next up are 'Eggs Best Friend' T-shirts and, if we reach our campaign goal, <strong>FREE YOKI EGG BOILERS</strong>, honouring your welcome contributions with signed certificates stating that they were the first batch ever made. For next stage contributors you'll be invited to our launch party as a VIP guest where you'll receive a signed book, written by Yoki's inventor, which presents Yoki's history as a fascinating, interactive story.

We provide an environment that fosters new connections, networks and cross disciplinary encounters. We are established in the last remaining wilderness of Europe, on the site of a farm in northern Sweden surrounded by incredible views of ancient spruce forests, just south of the arctic circle.<br/><br/>We believe that sustainability should be tackled by collaboration between disciplines. Floda31 will be a location for specialists from various professions to meet, collaborate and create solutions: Lots of space, ancient forest all around, a workshop full of tools, a network of creative thinkers and doers and plenty of time to play.</span></font></h3>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">We run curated residencies; a curator will set a brief and invite individuals from a mix of disciplines to respond to this and aim for an outcome. Other residencies run throughout the year with individuals setting their own agenda. Additionally we host bespoke workshops from time to time.<br/><br/>We need your help with our 'Friggebodar' curated residency (see below). <br/><br/><b>The Impact</b><br/>With all our projects, we will provide open source documentation about the process the methods used and their impact on the environment. The results will be published on Floda31.com, downloadable for all. We promote cross-disciplinary collaboration and aim for progress by doing. To establish this we host workshops at Floda31 with inspiring individuals from various backgrounds. <br/><br/><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b><br/>The project we need your help with, is the 'Friggebodar' project: A Friggebod is a small dwelling with a footprint of 15sqm or less. In Sweden you can build these without planning permission. Johan Berglund (42architects.com), our curator, has gathered a team of alumni from The Bartlett School of Architecture, Forestry specialists and Interaction designers to build two completely sustainable off-grid Friggebodar.<br/><br/>The design process is nearly complete (see progress here: floda31by8.wordpress.com/) and now we need your help to build these mini-houses. Your investment will help us develop and test new sustainable building and design techniques which we will share with the world via our website. All our learnings, successes and failures will be published in order to help all you other budding designers, architects, builders and DIYers with some useful advise. You also give young architects a chance to create a real physical building, and you will be part of something truly unique.<br/><br/>We are asking for $20.000. Not a small amount, we know. This is half the total needed, we are financing the rest. But think about it, $20.000 for a completely sustainable off-grid mini-house that can function at a climate ranging from +30C to -30C. We will give away the building plans and learned outcomes to anyone who needs it. So your money goes towards travel and food for the team members, materials (wood, energy production, water collection) and tools. The materials will be locally sourced of course, and team members will travel by train. Here are some pictures of some of the perks.</span></font></h3>

</div></div>","Our StoryFloda31 is a laboratory for innovation and creativity. We provide an environment that fosters new connections, networks and cross disciplinary encounters. We are established in the last remaining wilderness of Europe, on the site of a farm in northern Sweden surrounded by incredible views of ancient spruce forests, just south of the arctic circle.We believe that sustainability should be tackled by collaboration between disciplines. Floda31 will be a location for specialists from various professions to meet, collaborate and create solutions: Lots of space, ancient forest all around, a workshop full of tools, a network of creative thinkers and doers and plenty of time to play.
We run curated residencies; a curator will set a brief and invite individuals from a mix of disciplines to respond to this and aim for an outcome. Other residencies run throughout the year with individuals setting their own agenda. Additionally we host bespoke workshops from time to time.We need your help with our 'Friggebodar' curated residency (see below). The ImpactWith all our projects, we will provide open source documentation about the process the methods used and their impact on the environment. The results will be published on Floda31.com, downloadable for all. We promote cross-disciplinary collaboration and aim for progress by doing. To establish this we host workshops at Floda31 with inspiring individuals from various backgrounds. What We Need & What You GetThe project we need your help with, is the 'Friggebodar' project: A Friggebod is a small dwelling with a footprint of 15sqm or less. In Sweden you can build these without planning permission. Johan Berglund (42architects.com), our curator, has gathered a team of alumni from The Bartlett School of Architecture, Forestry specialists and Interaction designers to build two completely sustainable off-grid Friggebodar.The design process is nearly complete (see progress here: floda31by8.wordpress.com/) and now we need your help to build these mini-houses. Your investment will help us develop and test new sustainable building and design techniques which we will share with the world via our website. All our learnings, successes and failures will be published in order to help all you other budding designers, architects, builders and DIYers with some useful advise. You also give young architects a chance to create a real physical building, and you will be part of something truly unique.We are asking for $20.000. Not a small amount, we know. This is half the total needed, we are financing the rest. But think about it, $20.000 for a completely sustainable off-grid mini-house that can function at a climate ranging from +30C to -30C. We will give away the building plans and learned outcomes to anyone who needs it. So your money goes towards travel and food for the team members, materials (wood, energy production, water collection) and tools. The materials will be locally sourced of course, and team members will travel by train. Here are some pictures of some of the perks.

<h4>Why airfy Beacon? Because it saves energy and it's pure fun to have a smart home.<br/>
</h4>
<p>You wake up in the morning and pick up your phone. Suddenly, your apartment knows you're awake. It slowly <b>turns on the lights</b>. Your favorite morning <b>music starts</b> piping in. It starts heating the water for your shower. It turns on the coffee machine so by the time you make it to the kitchen, a big steaming mug is already waiting for you. This is just the beginning of your day with smart home automation, and for the first time this kind of customization is within reach of the normal person. <b>You don't need a multi-million-dollar mansion</b> with automation rigidly built in. You can do all of this in your<b>current home</b> - with <b>airfy Beacon</b>.</p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;"">What you need to use airfy Beacon:</b><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>airfy Beacon (buy here)</li>
<li>Light automation - Philips HUE™ (buy here at $386 perk)</li>
<li>NEST™ for smart heating</li>
<li>Smartphone</li>
<li>airfy Beacon App</li>
<li>Internet connection</li>
<li>Don't have a HUE? Get our Smart Home Starter Kit for $386</li>
</ul>
<h4>You want to have smart home but don't know what you need for that? </h4>
<p>For you we offer a perk with everything you need to automate your lights. It contains a Philips HUE set (3 bulbs) and two airfy beacons. Thats everything you need to start home automation today. Choose our $386 perk.</p>
<h4>Affordable, customizable and fun!</h4>
<p><b>airfy Beacon</b> allows you to make your home smart using one or more <i>“beacons”</i> - tiny receivers that connect to your phone through Bluetooth Low Energy (<b>iBeacon</b>). Just <b>wirelessly</b> hook the airfy System <b>combined</b> with <b>Philips HUE™</b> up to your lights, your heating with <b>NEST™ thermostate, </b>music player, or television, then use the airfy app to easily change its behavior based on your <b>proximity</b>, the time of day, the number of people in the apartment - almost anything you can think of. Basic functions such as the<b> television turning off when no one is in the room </b>can be programmed quickly <b>with no technical expertise</b> - just set the proximity on the app, the beacon notices when you leave the area and reacts accordingly. <b>More advanced</b>, imaginative functions can be achieved with just a little know-how and the right equipment. Set <b>custom lighting</b> programs or get notifications sent directly to your living room light bulb by <b>combining</b> your airfy <b>Beacon</b> with a <b>Philips Hue</b>. </p>
<p>Use <b>IFTTT </b>to set up complicated strings of processes based on whatever criteria you can think of or use airfy Beacon to control your NEST™ thermostate. The only limit really is your imagination.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h4>An easier way to save the environment—and money</h4>
<p>Don't worry about trying to conserve energy - let airfy Beacon do it for you. </p>
<ul>
<li>Set up your heating or air conditioning to turn off automatically when everyone has left the apartment — and turn back on when you get near.</li>
<li>Set your lights on a power-saving loop for while you're away on holidays. </li>
<li>No need to check that everything is turned off before going to bed — just set them to power off automatically after a certain time. </li>
<li>If you want to stay up late to watch TV, your presence in the room can override the command. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Make your airfy Beacon even more powerful — with Philips Hue™, Nest™ and IFTTT</h4>
<div><br/></div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/787466/files/20140814051511-1db17a8c4cfcdf18bbba1a6dd79bc100_large.jpg?1408018511"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> By combining your airfy Beacon with other products, you can vastly increase the possibilities and create almost anything you can think of. <b>Controll your NEST™ thermostat</b> to automate your heating even better. With Philips Hue™ light bulbs, you can program any color, brightness, pattern - whatever you want - all responding to the criteria you set. Connect your <b>beacon to IFTTT</b> to access a huge collection of recipes that make your day-to-day life more automatic - or flex your creative muscles and come up with your own! Want your significant other to get a message if you're already home and there's no milk in the fridge? Then make it happen! </p>

</div></div>","Why airfy Beacon? Because it saves energy and it's pure fun to have a smart home.

You wake up in the morning and pick up your phone. Suddenly, your apartment knows you're awake. It slowly turns on the lights. Your favorite morning music starts piping in. It starts heating the water for your shower. It turns on the coffee machine so by the time you make it to the kitchen, a big steaming mug is already waiting for you. This is just the beginning of your day with smart home automation, and for the first time this kind of customization is within reach of the normal person. You don't need a multi-million-dollar mansion with automation rigidly built in. You can do all of this in yourcurrent home - with airfy Beacon.
What you need to use airfy Beacon:

airfy Beacon (buy here)
Light automation - Philips HUE™ (buy here at $386 perk)
NEST™ for smart heating
Smartphone
airfy Beacon App
Internet connection
Don't have a HUE? Get our Smart Home Starter Kit for $386

You want to have smart home but don't know what you need for that? 
For you we offer a perk with everything you need to automate your lights. It contains a Philips HUE set (3 bulbs) and two airfy beacons. Thats everything you need to start home automation today. Choose our $386 perk.
Affordable, customizable and fun!
airfy Beacon allows you to make your home smart using one or more “beacons” - tiny receivers that connect to your phone through Bluetooth Low Energy (iBeacon). Just wirelessly hook the airfy System combined with Philips HUE™ up to your lights, your heating with NEST™ thermostate, music player, or television, then use the airfy app to easily change its behavior based on your proximity, the time of day, the number of people in the apartment - almost anything you can think of. Basic functions such as the television turning off when no one is in the room can be programmed quickly with no technical expertise - just set the proximity on the app, the beacon notices when you leave the area and reacts accordingly. More advanced, imaginative functions can be achieved with just a little know-how and the right equipment. Set custom lighting programs or get notifications sent directly to your living room light bulb by combining your airfy Beacon with a Philips Hue. 
Use IFTTT to set up complicated strings of processes based on whatever criteria you can think of or use airfy Beacon to control your NEST™ thermostate. The only limit really is your imagination.

An easier way to save the environment—and money
Don't worry about trying to conserve energy - let airfy Beacon do it for you. 

Set up your heating or air conditioning to turn off automatically when everyone has left the apartment — and turn back on when you get near.
Set your lights on a power-saving loop for while you're away on holidays. 
No need to check that everything is turned off before going to bed — just set them to power off automatically after a certain time. 
If you want to stay up late to watch TV, your presence in the room can override the command. 

Make your airfy Beacon even more powerful — with Philips Hue™, Nest™ and IFTTT


 By combining your airfy Beacon with other products, you can vastly increase the possibilities and create almost anything you can think of. Controll your NEST™ thermostat to automate your heating even better. With Philips Hue™ light bulbs, you can program any color, brightness, pattern - whatever you want - all responding to the criteria you set. Connect your beacon to IFTTT to access a huge collection of recipes that make your day-to-day life more automatic - or flex your creative muscles and come up with your own! Want your significant other to get a message if you're already home and there's no milk in the fridge? Then make it happen! 
airfy leadership team





The Dream Team

Christian Mehlis — Senior Software Engineer: C and Embedded C developer with more than 4 years of experience, embedded and operating systems specialist, part of the RIOT Internet of Things operating system working group, born and raised in Berlin (which is not a common thing).
Mariusz Cieśla — Lead Product Designer: previously a product, user experience and service designer as a freelancer, at several agencies and startups. Loves building products that make a difference, which made him join airfy.
Timea Konya — Designer: started poking the design field back in college. Experimented in traditional and digital art before diving professionally in the creative field. 
Leon George — Software Engineer: raised by cyborg parents (also known as: competent techies), grew up with technology since he was a kid. Developed interfaces for IT Security software (McAfee/Kaspersky). Part of the RIOT Internet of Things operating system working group.
Björn Walter — Technical assistant: Studies general religions and philosophy for a deep understanding of beyond physical matters while personally putting great value in handling of technical operation. 
Tech-Talk! 
We started off with a Raspberry Pi concept, through a couple of different custom-made PCBs to reach the point of production ready beacons, powered by two standard AA batteries. We chose AA batteries over coin batteries because the lifetime of a beacon on a coin-sized battery was not enough for the smart home applications. airfy Beacon with AA batteries will work up to 1.5 years. 


Ready for your own Mobile Application!


Use airfy Beacons in your own iOS™ or Android™ app to:

trigger actions based on your users proximity to a beacon
figure out their proximity in 3 zones: very close, near and far
uniquely identify each beacon and track the user passing them.

airfy Beacons use iBeacon compatible technology, to provide a configuration free experience.
Simply put the major and minor numbers you find on the backside of our beacon into our example code for  iOS™ or Android™, and be ready to range!



airfy Beacons are compatible with any phone supporting Bluetooth version 4.0, also called Bluetooth Low Energy or Bluetooth Smart™ . Examples of compatible phones are the iPhone 4S, 5, Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Google Nexus 5.
Open, hackable and maker friendly

At the heart of the airfy Beacon is a tiny super low power micro-computer.  The armm-zero core has 31 gpios, of which we expose 12 on easily accessible standard headers, for the maker community with love. Attaching your own peripherals and powering them from our unregulated 3Volts rail should be easy as pie. The popular NRF51822 by Nordic Semiconductor runs 32bit open source operating systems such as FreeRTOS or RIOT, which we even supported to some extend in our development forums. We chose the bigger 256kB flash to give you plenty of room for your own IoT applications.




Project timeline





Why crowdfunding?
When we decided to create a consumer friendly product, we knew that crowd funding was the best way to determine the demand for our product and gain market research. We couldn't anticipate that our backers would become a key part in order for us to build a better product. The experience was, and still is invaluable and we believe that with your support we can make smart homes available to everyone.
Current stage of the project 


PCB design is finished
App for iPhone is working. You can turn your lights on/off through the airfy Beacon app
The molding form is currently in production
Electronic parts like the BLE chip and all other parts are in our own stock for 1.000 pcs
Whats need to be done: (1) finalize IFTTT integration. We already have a contract with IFTTT and a channel to test everything. (2) If we reach the Android goal, we have to build the android app. (3) Security features are already tested (stretch goal) and need ongoing development if we can reach the goal.

<p><strong>A beautiful &amp; sustainable solution for package closure.</strong></p>
<p>     Bringing minimal and honest designs to life, our focus is to create sustainable and functional products that will last a lifetime. Innovation with simplicity and good design.</p>
<p><strong>GRIPPY</strong> is different. Made from stainless steel as opposed to plastic, GRIPPY is a sustainable and honest product. A simple tool, designed to close most bags that you open in your kitchen. Be it a snack, baking supplies, food storage, coffee or other food packages. This is a minimal yet functional product, designed with efficiency in mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581486065/psqe0xzwqgfc2dqlfuma.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As industrial designers, we inadvertently design and create many products made with plastic because of how easy the material is to control as well as it being very cost effective. But as designers, we also have a responsibility to create products that are honest, long lasting and leave the least amount of carbon footprint. This is why we decided to create <strong>GRIPPY</strong>, to replace a very common plastic product that has been on the market for a long time. We not only made it sustainable, we made it stronger, more elegant, functional and easy to use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581486086/qsdzhpqiigpajcdcwkoy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>GRIPPY</strong> is made with Stainless Steel 304(SAE 304), which is used for a wide variety of home and commercial applications. This is one of the most familiar and most frequently used alloys in the stainless steel family.  304 grade stainless steel is popular in the food industry because of its resistance to oxidation and corrosion. The chromium protects the product from oxidation or rust, whereas the nickel content rescues the food grade drum from corrosion. Stainless steel is also one of the most recycled materials on the planet.</p>
<p>The material, in its use or in its production process, respects the human being, especially in terms of health and safety.  A sustainable material does not harm the people working to produce it, or the people who handle it during its use, recycling and ultimate disposal. Stainless steel is not harmful to people during either its production or use. A protective layer forms naturally on all stainless steels because of the inclusion of chromium. The emission footprints of the material, especially those related to carbon, water and air, are minimized. Reuse and recyclability are at high levels.</p>

</div></div>","A beautiful & sustainable solution for package closure.
     Bringing minimal and honest designs to life, our focus is to create sustainable and functional products that will last a lifetime. Innovation with simplicity and good design.
GRIPPY is different. Made from stainless steel as opposed to plastic, GRIPPY is a sustainable and honest product. A simple tool, designed to close most bags that you open in your kitchen. Be it a snack, baking supplies, food storage, coffee or other food packages. This is a minimal yet functional product, designed with efficiency in mind.
 

 
As industrial designers, we inadvertently design and create many products made with plastic because of how easy the material is to control as well as it being very cost effective. But as designers, we also have a responsibility to create products that are honest, long lasting and leave the least amount of carbon footprint. This is why we decided to create GRIPPY, to replace a very common plastic product that has been on the market for a long time. We not only made it sustainable, we made it stronger, more elegant, functional and easy to use.
 

 

 
GRIPPY is made with Stainless Steel 304(SAE 304), which is used for a wide variety of home and commercial applications. This is one of the most familiar and most frequently used alloys in the stainless steel family.  304 grade stainless steel is popular in the food industry because of its resistance to oxidation and corrosion. The chromium protects the product from oxidation or rust, whereas the nickel content rescues the food grade drum from corrosion. Stainless steel is also one of the most recycled materials on the planet.
The material, in its use or in its production process, respects the human being, especially in terms of health and safety.  A sustainable material does not harm the people working to produce it, or the people who handle it during its use, recycling and ultimate disposal. Stainless steel is not harmful to people during either its production or use. A protective layer forms naturally on all stainless steels because of the inclusion of chromium. The emission footprints of the material, especially those related to carbon, water and air, are minimized. Reuse and recyclability are at high levels.

This technology causes liquids to bead up on the surface so you can simply wipe them away with a towel! The spillproof coating cannot be seen or felt at all and the rug’s surface is incredibly soft to the touch. Stains too tough to wipe away? Have no fear! Tumble is machine washable at all sizes (yep, even our largest 8’ x 10’ size). Simply pull the rug off the pad, throw it in the washer, and before you know it’ll be as good as new! The durable construction can withstand countless washes with no discoloration or fading. All Tumble rugs come with a cushioned non-slip rug pad. The rug pad features a ¼ inch thick foam layer (similar to that found in comfy sneakers) sandwiched between two layers of latex-free rubberized material. Perfect for playing with your kids, long hours in the kitchen, or even your morning yoga. Tumble rugs are non-toxic and have been rigorously tested to certify that they are free of harmful chemicals. The rug’s low pile surface does not collect pet hair or dust, while the pad’s rubberized surface stands up to pet claws and doesn’t allow liquids to ever seep in. The pad consists of multiple puzzle pieces (similar to a children’s play mat) so individual pieces can be removed and easily cleaned.                             If I order now, when and how can I select my design? At the top of the Indiegogo page, you can order now by clicking “Get this Perk” on your desired rug size. After checking out, you will receive a link via email within a few hours to select your exact rug design.

And is it Safe? Our rugs are coated with a water-based solution that is commonly used in medical and outdoor clothing. This coating helps separate the oils, stains, or liquids from the fabric, preventing any absorption. Tumble rugs are free of harmful chemicals such as PFCs (including PFOA and PFOS, which are commonly found in waterproof coatings), VOCs, formaldehyde, formamide, and latex. Because Tumble is completely spillproof, does it still feel and look like a normal rug?The spillproof coating is not visible and cannot be felt either. Our rug’s surface is very soft to the touch. Are Tumble rugs free of harmful chemicals?Our rugs are non-toxic and rigorously tested to the US safety standards at a CPSC approved testing laboratory. Tumble rugs are free of harmful chemicals such as PFCs (including PFOA and PFOS, which are commonly found in waterproof coatings), VOCs, formaldehyde, formamide, and latex. How do I clean my rug pad?

<p><strong>Early Bird Discount - $20 off until Jan 20, 2020</strong></p>
<p>With the emergence of smart video and audio assisted doorbells in homes across America, we wanted to expand the inner-peace such devices offer to non-home owners. As we tested our prototypes and talked with potential customers, we realized people who weren’t homeowners really wanted these devices as soon as possible. So we’ve fast-tracked our design while still focusing on producing a durable and solid product. We are only waiting for the manufacturing phase to complete in early 2020.</p>

<p> As seen in the photo below, both James Pritchett(left) and Doug Ohlson(right) are genuinely excited about this venture. Immediately after the idea was the discussed, the wheel was set in motion. They both went into action by filing multiple patent applications, planning their work then working their plan. Sadly, during the first 30 days of their plan execution, they saw heart-wrenching news stories of crimes taking place in local Atlanta apartment complexes and condos where an amazing video doorbell system could have possibly made a difference. Since renters find it difficult to install video doorbells, they knew their invention was a solution to a problem. Fortunate for them, Doug is an attorney and a successful business owner while James brings high-caliber Fortune 500 Marketing Director &amp; product management experience, award-winning design and is a self-proclaimed safety nut.

<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>The main body of Butter Twist is made out of Eastman Tritan, which is a premium food grade polymer found in high end water bottles and other kitchen products. It is BPA free and dishwasher safe. Since the front can come in contact with hot surfaces, we made it out of food grade, heat resistant Nylon material that is commonly found in spatulas and other products that are made to interact with heat. Finally, the wire is made from food grade stainless steel with a diameter carefully selected to provide a clean cut. It is robust enough to stand up to the day-to-day use it will encounter.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT MADE OUT OF?  </strong></p>
<p>We are using the highest quality food-grade Eastman Tritan BPA-Free polymer, heat resistant nylon, and a food-grade stainless steel cutting wire.  </p>
<p><strong>WILL THE WIRE BREAK?  </strong></p>
<p>We spent a long time and created countless prototypes to find just the right diameter that is extremely durable and still provides a clean cut. In other words, no.  </p>
<p><strong>HOW DO I LOAD IT?  </strong></p>
<p>Simply remove the cutter and push a stick into the tube. That’s it! We designed special barbs in the slider part to secure the butter and make this process as easy as possible.  </p>
<p><strong>CAN I USE HALF STICKS? </strong> </p>
<p>Yes! We designed our mechanism to work with any length of butter.  </p>
<p><strong>CAN I USE MY KERRYGOLD?  </strong></p>
<p>With a little work, yes. Cut your block in half and trim a bit off the height and it will fit just fine.  </p>
<p><strong>WILL IT FIT THE FATTER WEST COAST STICKS?</strong></p>
<p>Not yet.. unless you cut them to a slimmer size. We are currently only making Butter Twist to fit the thinner 1.25'' wide format. The fatter West Coast sticks are typically 1.5'' wide but you can find the thinner sticks at almost every grocery store nationwide. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Butter Twist is in the final stages of the design for manufacturing and materials procurement process. We've tested prototypes and made final adjustments to 3D CAD files in preparation for tooling.</p>
<p>We completed a successful Kickstarter raise to pay for tooling and development and the continued backing from Indiegogo will help fund our efforts to ensure that the product is completely dialed in for the best possible experience for our customers. Funds will also help to cover the first ""minimum order quantity"" production costs and inventory so that we can offer the product at a competitive price.</p>
<p>The biggest risk at this point would be a delay after the tooling process in order to get the product quality at the level that we will require for our brand. While we have budgeted a normal amount of time already for these tweaks, we will refuse to ship anything that does not meet our standards, which may result in a delay.</p>
<p>Other than that, it's a pretty simple product and we expect to deliver on time!</p>

<p>As cat parents, we all try our best to keep our little pals happy and healthy. Even we all know that cat's eating and drinking behavior is highly associated with their health, there seems no convenient and reliable way to keep track of it all the time.</p>
<p>That's where the Bistro smart cat feeder comes in. Inspired by Momo, a lovely and brave kitten's <a href=""#story"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color: rgb(244, 125, 77);""><u>true story</u></span></a>, Bistro is innovatively designed to monitor the appetite of your furry friend whenever you can’t. Have more than one cat? No problem! Bistro can tell <i>exactly</i> which of your darling little ones is feeding thanks to its advanced <a href=""#howitworks"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color: rgb(244, 125, 77);""><u>cat-facial recognition technology</u></span></a>. </p>

<p>With Bistro App, you can easily check your cat’s diet history (both food and water intake) or health report and even watch her live while she's having lunch – all from the palm of your hand! Bistro will also notify you <i>immediately </i>if there is any change to any of your pets’ health status that you need to know about.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>With Bistro, we’re building a closer relationship<b> </b>between you and your cats, one that not only provides you with a more intelligent, complete and quantified view of their health, but also keeps them happier and healthier than you’ve ever been able to before.<br/></p>

<h3>The feeder beyond imagining</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/676134/files/20140626002552-boom.jpg?1403767552"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/671447/files/20140624053732-bistro3d0119_cat_x_ray.361.jpg?1403613452"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Bistro is the world's first smart feeder that implements the ""<b>quantified cat</b>"" concept – just as <i>Quantified Self</i> products do for humans. Designed for any cat at least six months old, Bistro is both an automatic feeder and a health manager for the four-legged members of your family. With weight sensors (load sensors) beneath feeding tray and waterer, Bistro can track all the food and water your cat takes to further understand your kitty's daily dietary status, which is critical to their health. The convenient weighing scale also allows you to easily keep consistent track of your cat’s weight, and the built-in camera with cat-facial recognition function can always distinguish which cat is eating, making Bistro ideal for cat parents who care for multiple little ones.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Besides, when serving your cat at night or when the room is dark, the built-in LED lighting system will automatically turn on in a gradual and gentle way so that the cat-facial recognition can work perfectly without scaring your cat.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/688728/files/20140701233927-_HC_1461w.jpg?1404283167"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Simply plug-in, power up, and connect Bistro to your home WiFi network to enjoy the many awesome benefits it can bring to both you and your cats. It really is that easy to start caring for your little sweetheart in a smarter way.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<a id="""" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h3>How it works</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/707080/files/20140710014453-step-36.jpg?1404981893"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>1. When your cat comes and steps on Bistro, the built-in camera will be activated and stream the video to our backend server, which will run the <b>cat-facial recognition</b> algorithm to distinguish which cat it is. If the system has never seen this cat before, it will notify the owner to either create a new cat profile or link with existing one. The algorithm is based on years of research and development of deep learning technology. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/707082/files/20140710014520-step-37.jpg?1404981920"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>2. When your kitty is having a meal, the weight sensors (load sensors) beneath the feeding tray, waterer, and the weighing scale will measure the weights continuously. After the cat leaves, the system will <b>automatically calculate</b> the amount of food and water your cat took as well as their weight.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/707084/files/20140710014556-step-38.jpg?1404981956"" src="""" style=""""/></p>3. The measured data is then immediately sent through our cloud service to your smartphone, where you can easily review your cat's <b>diet history</b> and <b>health analysis report</b> with the Bistro App. You can easily check out individual data or the weekly or monthly trend chart. When visiting a vet and being asked about how well they eat and drink, you can show them the app with the most detailed diet and weight history. <p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<a id="""" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h3>Smart portion control</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Obesity is a serious threat to your beloved pets’ lives as over 57% of the one hundred million cats in US are currently overweight. Bistro comes with a complete cat food database and uses a precise weighing scale to determine the exact amount of food your little guys should have based on nutrition facts. If you have one cat, for example, you can simply configure how many meals you want your cat eat per day and Bistro will automatically calculate and dispense the correct amount of food for each meal. You can also set a daily allotment with unlimited times and Bistro will simply replenish the feeding tray as long as your cat hasn't eaten his daily allotment yet.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>However, the portion control setup with multiple cats can be a little trickier because every now and then, one cat might occasionally steal kibbles another cat left on the feeding tray. While this can make the portion control function less accurate, Bistro can help you try to outsmart the cat by letting you adjust the maximum amount of food to be left on the feeding tray to ensure as little as possible is available to be stolen by another cat. Even these precautions won’t always be able to stop a super hungry eater who tends to grab everything in sight. Therefore, to be as helpful as possible in creating solutions that work with particularly stubborn cats, we will fully open up the feeder APIs so cat-loving programmers and hackers can create new, sharable feeding strategies that the entire Bistro community can enjoy via the powerful Bistro app. </p> <p></p>

<a id="""" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h3>Bistro's Story</h3>
<p>Bistro began with a true story of Mu-Chi, the founder of Zillians, and one of his cats, Momo.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/713015/files/20140711025312-_MG_4293.JPG?1405191341"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Mu-Chi is a father of 3 cats, and they're all like family to him. One day, he found his cat daughter, Momo, weirdly paralyzed on the floor and groaning with pain. He was frightened and immediately took her to the vet. Momo was found to have serious dehydration and jaundice which was later diagnosed as pancreatitis – something that had caused her to stop her normal eating habits for days without him ever noticing. Combined with her congenital heart disease, the blood clots were formed and, in the end, paralyzed her.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks, no matter what Mu-Chi tried to save Momo, she showed no signs of improvement. Finally, he sadly said to himself, ""It's too painful, and maybe the vet is right – it's time to say goodbye.""</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/709973/files/20140711024253-IMG_3092.jpg?1405071773"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Right before putting her to sleep, he decided to serve her last meal despite the fact she hadn't eat much during that time. He opened up a canned fish and suddenly, a miracle happened. Momo started eating like crazy as if she knew it was the last time she’d be fed – Mu-Chi realized that she didn't want to die. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/707086/files/20140710014803-momo2-35.jpg?1404982083"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So he made up his mind to do anything possible to save her, including the surgery to amputate her hind legs. Fortunately, she finally recovered a month after and can walk by herself with two legs which is a wonder itself.<br/></p>
<p>However, Mu-Chi was left wondering how much suffering he could have saved Momo from if he’d been able to notice the change in her appetite at the very first time. This inspired him to form and lead a team to build Bistro with the simple goal of preventing such sorrow from ever happening again by providing an intelligent health management tool to help cat parents monitor their sweetheart's health in a smarter and better way.</p>

<h3>...cause LOVE is worth it</h3>
<p>Imagine having a full-time nanny for your lovely kitties. Imagine one who could care for them and make sure they eat and drink well 24/7 and that you could do so easily, with the press of a few buttons, no matter how far from home you might be. Imagine the freedom you’d experience knowing that you didn’t need to worry or feel guilty about the four-legged members of your family when you are away for days. Now stop imagining – that’s <i>exactly</i> what Bistro can do for you! </p>

<a id="""" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h3>Still have some questions?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Is Bistro suitable for any type of cat? </b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">➙ Bistro is recommended for use with cats at least six months old. <br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Is Bistro also an auto feeder?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">➙ Bistro is much more than an auto feeder. It's a smart feeder that provides several options on managing feeding for different demands. For example, you can set up reservation feeding or simply replenish what is available at certain times. <br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>What is the suggested retail price?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">➙ Bistro's retail price will be $249 USD.  However, we're offering a one-time promotional price saving up to 40% off to supports who pledge on Indiegogo!<br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Which mobile operating system is Bistro compatible with? </b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">➙ We currently have an <b>iOS</b> and <b>Android</b> version in development. We will also have <b>web app</b> for mobile/desktop!<br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Does Bistro support Ethernet and WiFi?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">➙ Bistro is compatible with 802.11 b/g/n WiFi standards but doesn't support a direct Ethernet connection. However, if there are many backers who need this feature, we'll add it for you. <br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Are there any extra fees associated with using the Bistro App?</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">➙ All features on the Bistro App will be FREE for every Bistro owner. We hope all cat parents can easily and freely enjoy a more intelligent way to hold your beloved ones in your hand when away from home. <br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Will Bistro offer worldwide delivery? </b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">➙ Absolutely! We are all about sharing this amazing cat health management product, Bistro, with every cat parent across the globe. However, additional shipping fees may apply to locations outside the US, Taiwan, Canada, Japan and Hong Kong.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b><b>How much water fits in the waterer</b>? </b><br/>➙ Cats, like all animals, need to have access to freely available fresh, clean water at all times. According to veterinarians, cats should drink 1 oz of water for every pound of body weight each day. So, if you have 2 adult cats each weighing 6 lbs, Bistro, which holds about 0.3 gallon (38 oz.) of water, would hold enough to last them for around 3 days. However, as water gets dirty over time, we recommend refilling the waterer <i>at least</i> every two days with once a day being the optimal choice for your cat's health. Bistro will also automatically warn you when the waterer level gets low.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b><b>How much food does it hold</b>? </b><br/>➙ Bistro can hold around 0.85 US gallons of food, or 13.6 cups. When the feeder runs low, the Bistro App will alert you to refill it in advance.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Can Bistro use canned (wet) food to feed my cats?<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">➙ Bistro doesn’t support canned (wet) food because it’s too hard to keep it fresh and the nozzle can be easily jammed by the wet food if it’s not cleaned up properly.</span>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b><b>Does Bistro work for dogs</b>? </b><br/>➙ Due to both the differences in size and facial features between the average cat and the average dog, Bistro is not recommended to be used for dogs. Although the facial recognition algorithm does work for dogs, the entire experience is not optimized for that. However, if enough dog lovers are interested, we’re very open to the idea of building a new Bistro for dogs.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b><b>What country is Bistro made in</b>? </b><br/>➙ Bistro is carefully constructed in Taiwan to ensure the highest quality.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b><b>What's the maximum number of cats Bistro can support</b>? </b><br/>➙ Although the cat-facial recognition could apply to any number of cats, one Bistro may run out of food too soon if there are too many. Therefore, we recommend using Bistro with up to 3 cats for ideal results.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b><b>I have more than 3 cats. Can I have multiple Bistros and connect them together</b>? </b><br/>➙ No problem at all! The Bistro App can connect to multiple Bistros and make them function as one. One of our dreams is to bring the fabulous benefits of Bistro to cat shelters around the world, so optimizing multiple Bistro units to work together has always been our development priority.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>I<b>s there a noisy motor that might scare my cat?</b></b><br/>➙ Bistro uses a super quiet stepper motor for controlling the feeder nozzle to ensure it neither moves suddenly nor makes high frequency noise. It's built with the highest standard of quality to meet the concerns of cat lovers everywhere.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b><b>What if </b><b>my cats’ faces are so similar that even I can't distinguish them from one another? </b></b><br/>➙ Bistro uses not only cat face traits but also the measured weight of the cat to determine which little sweetheart is using it at any given time. If they are, in fact, so identical that they might as well be clones, simply place a different collar on them. Thanks to our <i>deep learning</i> technology used to develop Bistro, our algorithm can tell the difference between your identical cats as long as a collar is observable from the camera. However, if your kitties don't want to wear a collar, we apologize, but, as advanced as it is, Bistro does not have the ability to read your cat’s minds to determine who is who. So, without at least some distinguishing physical characteristics, there's nothing we can do in this situation except hope for telepathic advances in future versions of Bistro......</li></ul>
<a id="""" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><p><b>[UPDATED#1 @ 07/16 9AM PST]</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b><b>Is Bistro indestructible? My cat can smash any pet feeder? </b></b><br/>➙ Bistro is designed to be very sturdy and heavy compared to other automatic pet feeders on the market. The feeder weighs 13 to 17 lbs or 5.9 to 7.7 kg (with food and water), and the semi-transparent shell is a single piece of strong plastic, so it's pretty hard to tear that down. Also, the food dispenser is completely redesigned so your cat needs to learn gripping the dispenser cap and twist it to release the food with *<b>both*</b> hands, which is physically impossible.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>What are the dimensions of the product? How large is the hole? </b><br/>➙ It's 184.5 x 190 x 424 mm (or 7.26 x 7.48 x 16.6 inches) for the feeder itself, and 283 x 545 x 18.5 mm (or 11.1 x 21.4 x 0.72 inches) for the platform (the weighing scale). The capsule-shaped hole is 110 x 200 mm (or 4.33 x 7.8 inches) (width by height)..</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>What's the material of the feeding tray and waterer? My cat gets pimples on her chin when using a plastic bowl? </b><br/>➙ We set out to build Bistro with the highest standards for cat lovers, so we built the feeding tray and waterer with <b>ceramic material</b> to minimize the problem. Although the ceramic material costs more than plastic, we believe it's the right thing to do, and we hope you find Bistro the most amazing smart feeder on the planet..</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Are there any consumable Items included with Bistro? Is there a filter in the water tank?? </b><br/>➙  Yes we do have activated carbon filter in the water tank which is a consumable item and replacement filters will be available for purchase on our website.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Does Bistro support wet food? </b><br/>➙ No, you can't put wet food in the food hopper. The feeding tray is not designed for cats fed primarily with wet food. We'd strongly suggest you to have only dry food for Bistro.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>How exactly does portion control work? My cats have a history of defeating all automated systems with respect to portion control, so I’d like to know if this is a system they’ll be able to work around? </b><br/>➙ You select on your smartphone the number of meals per day that your cat eats. Bistro knows your cat's weight and calculates the size of a meal. You can adjust the size of the meal your cat is given on your smartphone. Bistro knows how many meals have been served and the time of your cat's next meal. Bistro does not allow your cat to release more food by force or to outsmart it into releasing another meal. You always know what your cat is trying because Bistro updates your smartphone in real time..</li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Is there a warranty for Bistro? </b><br/>➙ Yes! Bistro comes with a one-year warranty when you receive the product.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Is cat facial recognition real? Is it a hoax?? </b><br/>➙ It's 100% real, and we are making not just a video but also a secret initiative to showcase our technology. Stay tuned! It will be super fun.</li></ul>

Top 3 reasons why you should own a Bistro!








The guardian for your cats



As cat parents, we all try our best to keep our little pals happy and healthy. Even we all know that cat's eating and drinking behavior is highly associated with their health, there seems no convenient and reliable way to keep track of it all the time.
That's where the Bistro smart cat feeder comes in. Inspired by Momo, a lovely and brave kitten's true story, Bistro is innovatively designed to monitor the appetite of your furry friend whenever you can’t. Have more than one cat? No problem! Bistro can tell exactly which of your darling little ones is feeding thanks to its advanced cat-facial recognition technology. 



With Bistro App, you can easily check your cat’s diet history (both food and water intake) or health report and even watch her live while she's having lunch – all from the palm of your hand! Bistro will also notify you immediately if there is any change to any of your pets’ health status that you need to know about.




With Bistro, we’re building a closer relationship between you and your cats, one that not only provides you with a more intelligent, complete and quantified view of their health, but also keeps them happier and healthier than you’ve ever been able to before.




The feeder beyond imagining


Bistro is the world's first smart feeder that implements the ""quantified cat"" concept – just as Quantified Self products do for humans. Designed for any cat at least six months old, Bistro is both an automatic feeder and a health manager for the four-legged members of your family. With weight sensors (load sensors) beneath feeding tray and waterer, Bistro can track all the food and water your cat takes to further understand your kitty's daily dietary status, which is critical to their health. The convenient weighing scale also allows you to easily keep consistent track of your cat’s weight, and the built-in camera with cat-facial recognition function can always distinguish which cat is eating, making Bistro ideal for cat parents who care for multiple little ones.

Besides, when serving your cat at night or when the room is dark, the built-in LED lighting system will automatically turn on in a gradual and gentle way so that the cat-facial recognition can work perfectly without scaring your cat.


Simply plug-in, power up, and connect Bistro to your home WiFi network to enjoy the many awesome benefits it can bring to both you and your cats. It really is that easy to start caring for your little sweetheart in a smarter way.

How it works




1. When your cat comes and steps on Bistro, the built-in camera will be activated and stream the video to our backend server, which will run the cat-facial recognition algorithm to distinguish which cat it is. If the system has never seen this cat before, it will notify the owner to either create a new cat profile or link with existing one. The algorithm is based on years of research and development of deep learning technology. 



2. When your kitty is having a meal, the weight sensors (load sensors) beneath the feeding tray, waterer, and the weighing scale will measure the weights continuously. After the cat leaves, the system will automatically calculate the amount of food and water your cat took as well as their weight.

3. The measured data is then immediately sent through our cloud service to your smartphone, where you can easily review your cat's diet history and health analysis report with the Bistro App. You can easily check out individual data or the weekly or monthly trend chart. When visiting a vet and being asked about how well they eat and drink, you can show them the app with the most detailed diet and weight history. 



Smart portion control

Obesity is a serious threat to your beloved pets’ lives as over 57% of the one hundred million cats in US are currently overweight. Bistro comes with a complete cat food database and uses a precise weighing scale to determine the exact amount of food your little guys should have based on nutrition facts. If you have one cat, for example, you can simply configure how many meals you want your cat eat per day and Bistro will automatically calculate and dispense the correct amount of food for each meal. You can also set a daily allotment with unlimited times and Bistro will simply replenish the feeding tray as long as your cat hasn't eaten his daily allotment yet.

However, the portion control setup with multiple cats can be a little trickier because every now and then, one cat might occasionally steal kibbles another cat left on the feeding tray. While this can make the portion control function less accurate, Bistro can help you try to outsmart the cat by letting you adjust the maximum amount of food to be left on the feeding tray to ensure as little as possible is available to be stolen by another cat. Even these precautions won’t always be able to stop a super hungry eater who tends to grab everything in sight. Therefore, to be as helpful as possible in creating solutions that work with particularly stubborn cats, we will fully open up the feeder APIs so cat-loving programmers and hackers can create new, sharable feeding strategies that the entire Bistro community can enjoy via the powerful Bistro app.  


Stay tuned to your little ones

















Bistro's Story
Bistro began with a true story of Mu-Chi, the founder of Zillians, and one of his cats, Momo.





Mu-Chi is a father of 3 cats, and they're all like family to him. One day, he found his cat daughter, Momo, weirdly paralyzed on the floor and groaning with pain. He was frightened and immediately took her to the vet. Momo was found to have serious dehydration and jaundice which was later diagnosed as pancreatitis – something that had caused her to stop her normal eating habits for days without him ever noticing. Combined with her congenital heart disease, the blood clots were formed and, in the end, paralyzed her.
In the next two weeks, no matter what Mu-Chi tried to save Momo, she showed no signs of improvement. Finally, he sadly said to himself, ""It's too painful, and maybe the vet is right – it's time to say goodbye.""



Right before putting her to sleep, he decided to serve her last meal despite the fact she hadn't eat much during that time. He opened up a canned fish and suddenly, a miracle happened. Momo started eating like crazy as if she knew it was the last time she’d be fed – Mu-Chi realized that she didn't want to die. 



So he made up his mind to do anything possible to save her, including the surgery to amputate her hind legs. Fortunately, she finally recovered a month after and can walk by herself with two legs which is a wonder itself.
However, Mu-Chi was left wondering how much suffering he could have saved Momo from if he’d been able to notice the change in her appetite at the very first time. This inspired him to form and lead a team to build Bistro with the simple goal of preventing such sorrow from ever happening again by providing an intelligent health management tool to help cat parents monitor their sweetheart's health in a smarter and better way.






...cause LOVE is worth it
Imagine having a full-time nanny for your lovely kitties. Imagine one who could care for them and make sure they eat and drink well 24/7 and that you could do so easily, with the press of a few buttons, no matter how far from home you might be. Imagine the freedom you’d experience knowing that you didn’t need to worry or feel guilty about the four-legged members of your family when you are away for days. Now stop imagining – that’s exactly what Bistro can do for you! 










Designing and testing out Bistro prototype has been a blast, but now we need your help scaling our vision and moving forward into the manufacturing stage. Our ultimate goal is to build a community for quantified cats and happy owners around the world. As soon as the funding from Indiegogo is secured, we will use these funds to move directly into the production stage.

Still have some questions?




Is Bistro suitable for any type of cat? ➙ Bistro is recommended for use with cats at least six months old. 


Is Bistro also an auto feeder?➙ Bistro is much more than an auto feeder. It's a smart feeder that provides several options on managing feeding for different demands. For example, you can set up reservation feeding or simply replenish what is available at certain times. 


What is the suggested retail price?➙ Bistro's retail price will be $249 USD.  However, we're offering a one-time promotional price saving up to 40% off to supports who pledge on Indiegogo!


Which mobile operating system is Bistro compatible with? ➙ We currently have an iOS and Android version in development. We will also have web app for mobile/desktop!


Does Bistro support Ethernet and WiFi?➙ Bistro is compatible with 802.11 b/g/n WiFi standards but doesn't support a direct Ethernet connection. However, if there are many backers who need this feature, we'll add it for you. 


Are there any extra fees associated with using the Bistro App?➙ All features on the Bistro App will be FREE for every Bistro owner. We hope all cat parents can easily and freely enjoy a more intelligent way to hold your beloved ones in your hand when away from home. 


Will Bistro offer worldwide delivery? ➙ Absolutely! We are all about sharing this amazing cat health management product, Bistro, with every cat parent across the globe. However, additional shipping fees may apply to locations outside the US, Taiwan, Canada, Japan and Hong Kong.




How much water fits in the waterer? ➙ Cats, like all animals, need to have access to freely available fresh, clean water at all times. According to veterinarians, cats should drink 1 oz of water for every pound of body weight each day. So, if you have 2 adult cats each weighing 6 lbs, Bistro, which holds about 0.3 gallon (38 oz.) of water, would hold enough to last them for around 3 days. However, as water gets dirty over time, we recommend refilling the waterer at least every two days with once a day being the optimal choice for your cat's health. Bistro will also automatically warn you when the waterer level gets low.



How much food does it hold? ➙ Bistro can hold around 0.85 US gallons of food, or 13.6 cups. When the feeder runs low, the Bistro App will alert you to refill it in advance.


Can Bistro use canned (wet) food to feed my cats?➙ Bistro doesn’t support canned (wet) food because it’s too hard to keep it fresh and the nozzle can be easily jammed by the wet food if it’s not cleaned up properly.




Does Bistro work for dogs? ➙ Due to both the differences in size and facial features between the average cat and the average dog, Bistro is not recommended to be used for dogs. Although the facial recognition algorithm does work for dogs, the entire experience is not optimized for that. However, if enough dog lovers are interested, we’re very open to the idea of building a new Bistro for dogs.

What country is Bistro made in? ➙ Bistro is carefully constructed in Taiwan to ensure the highest quality.

What's the maximum number of cats Bistro can support? ➙ Although the cat-facial recognition could apply to any number of cats, one Bistro may run out of food too soon if there are too many. Therefore, we recommend using Bistro with up to 3 cats for ideal results.

I have more than 3 cats. Can I have multiple Bistros and connect them together? ➙ No problem at all! The Bistro App can connect to multiple Bistros and make them function as one. One of our dreams is to bring the fabulous benefits of Bistro to cat shelters around the world, so optimizing multiple Bistro units to work together has always been our development priority.

Is there a noisy motor that might scare my cat?➙ Bistro uses a super quiet stepper motor for controlling the feeder nozzle to ensure it neither moves suddenly nor makes high frequency noise. It's built with the highest standard of quality to meet the concerns of cat lovers everywhere.

What if my cats’ faces are so similar that even I can't distinguish them from one another? ➙ Bistro uses not only cat face traits but also the measured weight of the cat to determine which little sweetheart is using it at any given time. If they are, in fact, so identical that they might as well be clones, simply place a different collar on them. Thanks to our deep learning technology used to develop Bistro, our algorithm can tell the difference between your identical cats as long as a collar is observable from the camera. However, if your kitties don't want to wear a collar, we apologize, but, as advanced as it is, Bistro does not have the ability to read your cat’s minds to determine who is who. So, without at least some distinguishing physical characteristics, there's nothing we can do in this situation except hope for telepathic advances in future versions of Bistro......
[UPDATED#1 @ 07/16 9AM PST]


Is Bistro indestructible? My cat can smash any pet feeder? ➙ Bistro is designed to be very sturdy and heavy compared to other automatic pet feeders on the market. The feeder weighs 13 to 17 lbs or 5.9 to 7.7 kg (with food and water), and the semi-transparent shell is a single piece of strong plastic, so it's pretty hard to tear that down. Also, the food dispenser is completely redesigned so your cat needs to learn gripping the dispenser cap and twist it to release the food with *both* hands, which is physically impossible.


What are the dimensions of the product? How large is the hole? ➙ It's 184.5 x 190 x 424 mm (or 7.26 x 7.48 x 16.6 inches) for the feeder itself, and 283 x 545 x 18.5 mm (or 11.1 x 21.4 x 0.72 inches) for the platform (the weighing scale). The capsule-shaped hole is 110 x 200 mm (or 4.33 x 7.8 inches) (width by height)..

What's the material of the feeding tray and waterer? My cat gets pimples on her chin when using a plastic bowl? ➙ We set out to build Bistro with the highest standards for cat lovers, so we built the feeding tray and waterer with ceramic material to minimize the problem. Although the ceramic material costs more than plastic, we believe it's the right thing to do, and we hope you find Bistro the most amazing smart feeder on the planet..

Are there any consumable Items included with Bistro? Is there a filter in the water tank?? ➙  Yes we do have activated carbon filter in the water tank which is a consumable item and replacement filters will be available for purchase on our website.

Does Bistro support wet food? ➙ No, you can't put wet food in the food hopper. The feeding tray is not designed for cats fed primarily with wet food. We'd strongly suggest you to have only dry food for Bistro.

How exactly does portion control work? My cats have a history of defeating all automated systems with respect to portion control, so I’d like to know if this is a system they’ll be able to work around? ➙ You select on your smartphone the number of meals per day that your cat eats. Bistro knows your cat's weight and calculates the size of a meal. You can adjust the size of the meal your cat is given on your smartphone. Bistro knows how many meals have been served and the time of your cat's next meal. Bistro does not allow your cat to release more food by force or to outsmart it into releasing another meal. You always know what your cat is trying because Bistro updates your smartphone in real time..


Is there a warranty for Bistro? ➙ Yes! Bistro comes with a one-year warranty when you receive the product.



Is cat facial recognition real? Is it a hoax?? ➙ It's 100% real, and we are making not just a video but also a secret initiative to showcase our technology. Stay tuned! It will be super fun.

<p><strong>What makes Paragon different?</strong></p>
<p>The Paragon induction cooktop directly monitors cooking temperature, offering precise control for a wide variety of cooking styles. Precision cooking with Paragon is easy and produces repeatable, restaurant-quality results.</p>
<p>The Paragon induction cooktop uses Bluetooth™ technology to maintain cookware and food at a precise temperature. Feedback from wireless temperature sensors controls the heat to maintain the desired temperature with minimal fluctuation during the entire cooking process.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Paragon mat for?</strong></p>
<p>The Paragon mat is our newest addition to the family of Paragon smart sensing accessories. The Paragon mat is about 11.75"" in diameter and contains an embedded temperature sensor which communicates cookware temperature to the cooktop. This cutting-edge technology enables stunning, repeatable results for sautéing, simmering, searing, sauces, and a variety of challenging-yet-essential cooking methods.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Paragon probe for?</strong></p>
<p>The Paragon probe is primarily designed for sous vide cooking and liquid temperature control applications. The sous vide technique is becoming popular among consumers who want to replicate the results achieved in high-end restaurants, right at home. In sous vide cooking, the chef places food in a zipper bag and submerges under water for an hour or more at the desired temperature. Food cooked in this way will emerge edge-to-edge at the desired temperature.</p>
<p>Great chefs nearly always follow sous vide cooking with a searing step, and this is where Paragon really stands out. Using the Paragon mat, cooks can sear at a precise temperature, keeping the pan from overheating while rapidly responding to any drop in temperature (as commonly occurs when food is added to a hot pan). No more burned butter or overcooked, tough steak!</p>
<p><strong>Are the new mat and probe compatible with the original Paragon?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the new mat and probe accessories were designed to be fully backward compatible with the original Paragon induction cooktop. </p>
<p><strong>What can I cook on Paragon?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest benefits of Paragon can be stated in three broad categories: meats, everyday foods, and culinary basics.</p>
<p><em>Meats</em> like steak, pork roasts, fish, and scallops require delicate handling, and Paragon excels at every step. Using the Paragon probe, cooks can prepare the meat to their desired final cooking temperature through sous vide cooking. Cooks will then follow up with a precision searing step, a simple and effective way to produce a step-by-step culinary masterpiece.</p>
<p><em>Everyday foods</em> like grilled cheese, pancakes, and hamburgers are staples of our cooking repertoire, but cooking them perfectly every time can elude even experienced chefs. Using the Paragon mat, moms, dads, kids and college students can recreate their personal-best cooking results time after time. Whether you like your eggs over-medium or sunny-side-up, the Paragon mat will bring a whole new level of precision and repeatability to your cooking game.</p>
<p><em>Culinary basics</em> are the essential building blocks of perfectly executed food. From gumbo to gravy, food is better when cooked the way it was originally intended. Essentials like caramelized onions, brown butter, and roux have traditionally required patience, skill, and vast amounts of attention. The Paragon mat enables stress-free preparations of even the most vexing dishes, with stunning results on the first try.</p>
<p><strong>What cooking methods does Paragon support?</strong></p>
<p>The Paragon induction cooktop is a single device capable of cooking using several precision cooking methods. Sous vide, searing, sautéing, simmering, and holding at precise serving temperature are all assisted by the probe and the mat.</p>
<p><strong>Can the mat and the probe be used at the same time?</strong></p>
<p>Paragon only supports the use of one Bluetooth™ accessory at a time. For the types of cooking recommended for Paragon, a single source of precise temperature input is sufficient to produce stunning, repeatable results.</p>
<p><strong>How do you switch between the mat and the probe?</strong></p>
<p>The mat and the probe both accept an easily swappable Bluetooth™ module, which is included with every Paragon induction cooktop. This speedy swapping enables a quick change from sous vide cooking to precision searing.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>The wireless temperature sensor continuously monitors temperature and wirelessly send this information to the cooktop, which automatically adjusts the burner’s heat output to maintain the desired temperature. The temperature can be controlled either directly on the cooktop or via the Paragon app.</p>
<p><strong>What is included when I buy Paragon?</strong></p>
<p><em>Paragon induction cooktop:</em> A 1200-Watt cooktop that supports BlueTooth™-enabled smart cooking</p>
<p><em>Paragon mat:</em> A Bluetooth™-enabled silicone mat for controlling cookware temperature</p>
<p><em>Paragon probe:</em> A Bluetooth™-enabled temperature probe for sous vide and more</p>
<p><em>Paragon Bluetooth™ module:</em> Swappable between the mat and probe for precision temperature monitoring and control</p>
<p><em>Paragon app:</em> Free download from the App Store</p>
<p><em>Micro-USB charging cable:</em> For convenient charging of the Bluetooth™ module</p>
<p><strong>How do the mat and the probe work?</strong></p>
<p>The mat and the probe each include a wireless temperature sensor that constantly monitors temperature. The temperature is transmitted via Bluetooth™ to the cooktop, which adjusts burner heat to ensure your food is cooked to perfection.</p>
<p><strong>How do I recharge the Bluetooth™ module?</strong></p>
<p>The wireless temperature sensor has a battery life of about 30 hours. The battery life indicator will blink when the battery is low. To recharge, connect to a computer or wall outlet via the micro-USB port and included cable.</p>
<p><strong>What type of cookware do I need?</strong></p>
<p>Paragon works with any induction-compatible cookware. To test whether your pot or pan works with induction, just verify that a magnet clings when held against the bottom of the cookware. Many, if not most, pots and pans work with induction cooktops. Induction-ready pots are widely available, and start at a very reasonable price.</p>
<p>If you don't yet have induction pots or pans, we recommend Chantal induction cookware because their line of Japanese-steel cookware provides a chemical-free, energy-efficient way to cook on any stovetop, including magnetic-induction stoves. Additionally, all Chantal cookware is specifically designed to go from freezer to stove to table and then directly into the dishwasher.</p>
<p><strong>How big is Paragon?</strong></p>
<p>The glass cooktop surface is about 11.75 inches in diameter. It stores comfortably under the counter.</p>
<p><strong>What is so special about induction cooking?</strong></p>
<p>Traditional electric cooktops can provide only one power level: HOT! They create a range of temperatures by cycling the heater on and off at varying frequencies.</p>
<p>Paragon monitors the food temperature and applies heat only when needed, allowing for accurate and consistent control of the cooking process. That’s why induction cooking is renowned for delicate cooking needs like melting chocolate.</p>
<p>Paragon uses magnetic induction to heat the pan, not the glass cooktop. This provides for quick, efficient and safe heating of your food and faster cooling of the glass cooktop.</p>
<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>
<p>The Paragon Induction Cooking System will be sold at an estimated retail price of $349. We are offering a significant discount for our Indiegogo backers who support Paragon now.</p>

The mat and the probe both accept an easily swappable Bluetooth™ module, which is included with every Paragon induction cooktop. This speedy swapping enables a quick change from sous vide cooking to precision searing.
How does it work?
The wireless temperature sensor continuously monitors temperature and wirelessly send this information to the cooktop, which automatically adjusts the burner’s heat output to maintain the desired temperature. The temperature can be controlled either directly on the cooktop or via the Paragon app.
What is included when I buy Paragon?
Paragon induction cooktop: A 1200-Watt cooktop that supports BlueTooth™-enabled smart cooking
Paragon mat: A Bluetooth™-enabled silicone mat for controlling cookware temperature
Paragon probe: A Bluetooth™-enabled temperature probe for sous vide and more
Paragon Bluetooth™ module: Swappable between the mat and probe for precision temperature monitoring and control
Paragon app: Free download from the App Store
Micro-USB charging cable: For convenient charging of the Bluetooth™ module
How do the mat and the probe work?
The mat and the probe each include a wireless temperature sensor that constantly monitors temperature. The temperature is transmitted via Bluetooth™ to the cooktop, which adjusts burner heat to ensure your food is cooked to perfection.
How do I recharge the Bluetooth™ module?
The wireless temperature sensor has a battery life of about 30 hours. The battery life indicator will blink when the battery is low. To recharge, connect to a computer or wall outlet via the micro-USB port and included cable.
What type of cookware do I need?
Paragon works with any induction-compatible cookware. To test whether your pot or pan works with induction, just verify that a magnet clings when held against the bottom of the cookware. Many, if not most, pots and pans work with induction cooktops. Induction-ready pots are widely available, and start at a very reasonable price.
If you don't yet have induction pots or pans, we recommend Chantal induction cookware because their line of Japanese-steel cookware provides a chemical-free, energy-efficient way to cook on any stovetop, including magnetic-induction stoves. Additionally, all Chantal cookware is specifically designed to go from freezer to stove to table and then directly into the dishwasher.
How big is Paragon?
The glass cooktop surface is about 11.75 inches in diameter. It stores comfortably under the counter.
What is so special about induction cooking?
Traditional electric cooktops can provide only one power level: HOT! They create a range of temperatures by cycling the heater on and off at varying frequencies.
Paragon monitors the food temperature and applies heat only when needed, allowing for accurate and consistent control of the cooking process. That’s why induction cooking is renowned for delicate cooking needs like melting chocolate.
Paragon uses magnetic induction to heat the pan, not the glass cooktop. This provides for quick, efficient and safe heating of your food and faster cooling of the glass cooktop.
How much does it cost?
The Paragon Induction Cooking System will be sold at an estimated retail price of $349. We are offering a significant discount for our Indiegogo backers who support Paragon now.

We recommend opening as soon as possible. Compressed filling takes up to a day to regain its original size and shape.  I  frequently sacrifice my sleep in order to balance my work and family. I was always so tired that I would take a nap anywhere and anytime I had the chance. I couldn’t find a cushion or pillow that allowed me to release the stress and get the most comfortable rest. One day, my daughter was playing with slime and said she wants to touch it all day long even when she goes to bed because she liked that gummy feeling. However, I couldn’t let her play with the slime since the ingredients of the slime-like boric-acid and sodium-borate include harmful chemicals. my daughter loves to play with slime! I decided to create a soft but stretchy, and safe feeling ‘slime-like stress ball’ so that everyone can use it. Well, it was NOT EASY. Choosing a perfect fabric for soft and gummy feeling, with hypo-allergenic (because my daughter has very sensitive skin), should be easy to wash but does not get stuffy. We had a hard time communicating with factories while we choose the perfect fabric, and the GIANT package shipping was a challenge.  But ultimately, our final CL9 cushion is born! The final CL9 cushion is made with stretchy spandex + soft velvet fabric. Soft and stretchy cover helps you to stretch and shape cushion easier. The Short cut microfiber filling makes you more comfortable and relaxed. We are happy to introduce CL9 cushion set to many of you through Kickstarter, and looking forward to launch more awesome projects.  Risks and challengesShipping packages worldwide can be very challenging. So we have worked hard to ensure that our products are delivered properly. We will be transparent and communicate any issues or delays that arise. You can always reach out to us with any concerns or questions and we will do our best to resolve them.",49.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Before anything else, our product must be an <strong>outstanding vacuum cleaner</strong>. </p>
<p>The Pure Cordless excels at these three major factors where others are compromised. </p>
<p>Our <strong>patented technology</strong> delivers enduring power that cannot be matched and our unique platform delivers the rest.</p>
<p>The Pure Cordless is a premium machine featuring the latest technology in brushless motors, batteries and dust collection. </p>
<p>There is no better machine for gathering dust and dirt, and our HEPA filtration captures 99.97% of fine dust and allergens. </p>

<p>Lupe's enduring suction comes from inner <strong>strength</strong>.</p>
<p>Our <strong>patented </strong>Suction Intensifier delivers the <strong>strongest </strong>and most <strong>efficient suction </strong>of any cordless out there, with no compromise in picking up any debris type.</p>
<p>See for yourself how we compare to the competition on an exceptional challenge of 20mm (0.8 inches) deep grooves filled with dust :</p>

<p><strong>Patented Suction Intensifier technology</strong></p>
<p>Optimum pick up across different surfaces and debris types <strong>all</strong> the time, with no settings to change.</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> - Powerful motorised agitator for cleaning hair and deep-down dirt – <strong>great for carpet.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>2</strong> - Air tight rotating seal conforms to all surfaces and debris, preventing unnecessary leaks and increasing suction - <strong>great for hard floors.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>- Velocity vane increases air velocity by reducing the opening on the floor surface.</p>
<p>Increased velocity and eliminated leaks results in up to <strong>x10 </strong>the useful suction at the cleaner head compared to some conventional designs.  </p>
<p><strong>Doing more with less. That’s the power of pure.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>One cleaning head</strong></p>
<p>Rather than multiple cleaning heads, we focused on one head capable of cleaning all surfaces, one that seamlessly moves from one surface to another.</p>
<p>There’s no longer any need to have multiple vacuums (or multiple heads) for different tasks. </p>
<p>Because sometimes, one head really is better than two.  </p>

<h3><strong>Social and environmental impact </strong></h3>
<p>Did you know<strong> 50%</strong> of small electrical appliances taken to waste processing in the European Union is from vacuum cleaners? It's pretty shocking.</p>
<div data-id=""25279181""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1561048602/uwnqqeldey46nl3clprw.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div>
<p>Especially in cordless vacuums, many companies launch 'new' products year after year which drives perfectly usable, or easily repairable product to waste.</p>
<p>Lupe is different. And the Pure Cordless is different. It is <strong>fully serviceable</strong> and almost every part can be replaced. It has been designed to be as long-lasting as possible: using the <strong>best </strong>components and materials. </p>
<p>It's been designed to be as <strong>easy to maintain </strong>as possible. We will support<strong> long-term ownership</strong> through open supply of spares and making upgrades available to battery packs and motors as technology moves on. </p>
<p>You don't throw your whole bicycle away if you want to upgrade a wheel or fit a new tyre - we take that approach to vacuum cleaners.  </p>
<p>We all need great performing products but in an age of huge waste a more conscious effort is required to make essential products last just a little longer. </p>
<p>Its our founding principle.</p>
<p>See how the Pure Cordless is different:</p>

Say hello to the Lupe Pure Cordless.  
The world's best performing cordless vacuum.
Designed and built for long-term ownership.
The cordless, fully realised...finally. 

 As seen in:


Before anything else, our product must be an outstanding vacuum cleaner. 
The Pure Cordless excels at these three major factors where others are compromised. 
Our patented technology delivers enduring power that cannot be matched and our unique platform delivers the rest.
The Pure Cordless is a premium machine featuring the latest technology in brushless motors, batteries and dust collection. 
There is no better machine for gathering dust and dirt, and our HEPA filtration captures 99.97% of fine dust and allergens. 

 
unrivalled suction power through patented technology

Lupe's enduring suction comes from inner strength.
Our patented Suction Intensifier delivers the strongest and most efficient suction of any cordless out there, with no compromise in picking up any debris type.
See for yourself how we compare to the competition on an exceptional challenge of 20mm (0.8 inches) deep grooves filled with dust :

How does it work? Unassuming on the outside, you have to look within to find the source of Lupe’s enduring power:

Patented Suction Intensifier technology
Optimum pick up across different surfaces and debris types all the time, with no settings to change.
1 - Powerful motorised agitator for cleaning hair and deep-down dirt – great for carpet. 
2 - Air tight rotating seal conforms to all surfaces and debris, preventing unnecessary leaks and increasing suction - great for hard floors. 
3 - Velocity vane increases air velocity by reducing the opening on the floor surface.
Increased velocity and eliminated leaks results in up to x10 the useful suction at the cleaner head compared to some conventional designs.  
Doing more with less. That’s the power of pure. 
 

outstanding dust cleaning performance for a full 60 minutes


Power is nothing without endurance. Unlike other models, the pure cordless offers outstanding dust cleaning performance for a full 60 minutes. 
Put simply, the Pure Cordless cleans significantly more than the competition between charges.  
More cleaning, less charging. That’s the power of pure.  
 

unique format adapts to every cleaning task


The Lupe Pure Cordless is a true 3-in-1 vacuum that offers the best of all worlds wrapped into one convenient package, and has outstanding reach to high places (2m/6.5ft)
the pure cordless has a 2m reach
Conventional cordless stick vacuums put all the weight in your hand, Lupe’s unique format makes cleaning high easy with significantly less weight to lift:
less weight in hand for high reach cleaning
Taking the cleaning head off to switch between configurations is really quick and easy.
Fully capable but smaller in size
We've aimed to bring the whole-house vacuum up to date with the 21st century. The Pure Cordless is slim and convenient but packed with power.

 
One cleaning head
Rather than multiple cleaning heads, we focused on one head capable of cleaning all surfaces, one that seamlessly moves from one surface to another.
There’s no longer any need to have multiple vacuums (or multiple heads) for different tasks. 
Because sometimes, one head really is better than two.  



 
Social and environmental impact 
Did you know 50% of small electrical appliances taken to waste processing in the European Union is from vacuum cleaners? It's pretty shocking.

Especially in cordless vacuums, many companies launch 'new' products year after year which drives perfectly usable, or easily repairable product to waste.
Lupe is different. And the Pure Cordless is different. It is fully serviceable and almost every part can be replaced. It has been designed to be as long-lasting as possible: using the best components and materials. 
It's been designed to be as easy to maintain as possible. We will support long-term ownership through open supply of spares and making upgrades available to battery packs and motors as technology moves on. 
You don't throw your whole bicycle away if you want to upgrade a wheel or fit a new tyre - we take that approach to vacuum cleaners.  
We all need great performing products but in an age of huge waste a more conscious effort is required to make essential products last just a little longer. 
Its our founding principle.
See how the Pure Cordless is different:

1- Battery pack removable without tools
2- Brushless motor housed in separate removable housing 
3- Washable lifetime filters
4- Single service panel reveals access to motor and control PCB
5- Detachable pickup head has removable components and no PCB electronics on board
6- Dust separation system is self-contained and made from polycarbonate for exceptional durability 
7- All control electronics centrally housed and re-programmable
 
the Pure Cordless has been expertly engineered in detail to ensure the design can stand the test of time
The Pure Cordless will be built in a factory that pay workers fairly, have high standards of health and safety and is ISO14001 certified. It is committed to conducting business in a manner that delivers continuous improvement in environmental performance and protects the quality of communities where it operates.  
Our chosen factory:

harvests rainwater
collects solar energy
makes use of a ground source system for climate control

 

We wanted the Pure Cordless to be everything you'd expect of a modern vacuum cleaner, not just a cordless, and we have integrated every feature to the highest possible specification.

 
1- Pickup Head:

The most energy-efficient dust pick-up technology available intensifies the suction for deep-down cleaning across all surfaces - no settings to change. 
Two motorised agitators deal with any debris type - large, fine and pet hair. 
Easy to remove both brush rollers simply using a coin:
2- Motor:

Our Japanese brushless motor spins at 108,000rpm (twice as fast as a jet engine) and has exceptional energy efficiency. It's also exceptionally durable.3- Cyclonic Bagless Separator:With two stages of cyclonic separation and two stages of filtration the Pure Cordless is at the cutting edge of dust separation technology.With a genuine 1000cc (1 liter) capacity the Lupe pure cordless has the one of the largest bin capacities of any cordless. Less bin emptying to get the job done quicker.  It is also really easy to empty:4- Battery:The Pure Cordless 32.4V 81Wh Li-Ion battery delivers 60 minutes of powerful cleaning from one single charge. The LEDs on the front communicate accurate charge capacity remaining.The battery can be charged on the machine with no dock, or taken out and charged discretely while the machine is stowed away in a cupboard.Easy to replace or upgrade in the future:More cleaning, less charging. That’s the power of pure. The Pure Cordless has 9 Murata (formerly Sony) high drain, high capacity lithium-ion cells. The battery pack is fitted with a fully featured protection board to monitor health of the battery and communicate with the control system in the Pure Cordless to always ensure optimum performance.5- HEPA Anti-Allergy Filter:A genuine HEPA (H13) filter separating 99.97% of fine dust and allergens down to 0.3 millionths of a meter. Easy to remove and wash for optimum performance. Other brands use lower grade filters that allow 100's of times more fine dust through. Accept no substitutes. That's the power of pure.Accessory Tools:We've focused on giving you the multi-function accessory tools that are useful, not a drawer-full that clutters your home and never gets used. An upholstery tool and a crevice tool both with slide up/down bristles for dusting. The Pure Cordless is supplied with a holder to attach them to the product to save you losing them.Simple Controls:The Pure Cordless has very simple controls to access the three power modes and to turn-off/override the brush roller for delicate surfaces. The Pure Cordless has been designed and built with two principles at heart - purity of purpose, and longevity of design. We’ve designed and built the best possible product with the singular purpose of keeping your home clean, and we’ve designed it to last: no built-in obsolescence, no superseding product every year.  It's not just us that likes the design- we've won an award!We have spent the last 3.5 years developing the pure cordless to perfection and we are now ready to start production.3.5 years of evolution of the Lupe pure cordless

As we progress now from our Research and Development stage into getting our product to market, its very important to us to build a following and get our product known about as much as possible.  We have been very successful on another crowdfunding platform prior to Indiegogo InDemand and now we are in the pre-production stages with our product at our factory. Every sale we make before production helps us, and in return for your early backing we are offering you a big discount from the standard retail price of ± £699 / USD 869. This is our production timeline from now until you receive your Lupe Pure Cordless.
 Thank you for supporting our campaign and a special thank you to everyone else who has helped us on our journey so far. It would not have been possible without the support of everyone involved - friends, family, investors, advisers and our manufacturing partner. We look forward to the next stage of our journey in delivering the ultimate cordless vacuum",70.0,1,"1 Campaign

Check out the review from hair specialist Guy Tang

Being tied to the power outlet also makes it difficult when sharing a bathroom with others. The Lylux cordless hair dryer sets you free from the cord, dries hair quickly and simplifies your life. Say goodbye to cords and take your hair dryer anywhere.

<li>We create a detailed 3D CAD model using NASA data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</li>
<li>We make 1:1 masters in tool grade steel for both the 100mm desktop and 180mm wall versions.</li>
<li>After the master has been precision machined, the top surface is then sandblasted to create the perfect texture for the concrete to capture in each impression.</li>
<li>Moulds are then made from the master which will be used to cast each piece.</li>
<li>The concrete is mixed in small batches from a combination of Portland cement and aggregates to carefully control the amount of bubbles produced during the curing process.</li>
<li>Each piece is then cast using the freshly mixed jewellery grade concrete and allowed to set.</li>
<li>Once fully hardened each piece is carefully removed from the mould and sent for further processing to ensure all the edges are smoothed and details come out perfectly.</li>
<li>Every cement piece is then inspected and carefully packaged as it awaits final assembly.</li>
<li>Each metal base is machined using hardened Tungsten tipped cutting tools, then sent for anodizing to give it a deep Space Grey finish.</li>
<li>The DeskSpace mirror finish logo is added using a special process where the whole face is polished, the logo then masked before the rest of the surfaces are sandblasted to a smooth matte finish.</li>
<li>The final step comes by assembling the concrete impression of the lunar surface with the anodized metal base, held securely with an epoxy-based adhesive.</li>
<li>The final parts are then handed over to be precisely packaged in the gift box with the other accessories.</li>

This can easily be achieved with either a desktop lamp for ceiling light for when the large piece is hung on a wall.Direct lighting across the Lunar Surface gives best results Direct lighting across the Lunar Surface gives best results Learn about the Moon and Apollo 11 lunar landing Included with your DeskSpace Lunar Surface is a high quality, a heavyweight book designed to provide you with interesting, intriguing and fun facts about the Moon and lunar landing. The book offers detailed images and a clever design that allows it to nestle inside the box, then unfold to reveal a stunning full-bleed image of the moon. This is the perfect addition to the Lunar Surface and turns it from a curiosity into a practical gift for all space enthusiasts.   What’s in the box We have paid close attention to every detail of the unboxing experience. We pride ourselves on quality and this comes down to every part including the packaging. Each Lunar Surface comes in a high-quality ridged gift box, with the concrete model and base protected with layers of EVA foam. The set also includes a bespoke information booklet, letter of authenticity with a unique serial number and a cleaning cloth.  Extension of DeskSpace Series We are proud to present the Lunar Surface model as the next part on our space-themed journey. The base of the small Lunar Surface perfectly matches the Solar System Mood Lamp and the solar system planet set. Each item has been carefully crafted to the correct proportions to sit perfectly alongside each other and even comes with matching gift boxes and accessories packs. Once you buy one item from DeskSpace, you will never turn back.  The Perks - Indiegogo Special Save up to 15%​All prices shown in USD The Perks  - Bulk Buy SavingsAll prices shown in USD Indiegogo Exclusive Add-on Item​All prices shown in USD School For the Blind Donations We are excited to announce that we will be donating a Lunar Surface Large concrete panel to a number of schools for the blind across the US and Hong Kong. We think STEM education is crucially important and feel this project would give a unique experience for blind students to get a tactile representation of the lunar surface that they might not have had access to before. For every US$2500 (HKD20K) we raise on this campaign we donate one set of the large lunar surface concrete panels to a school for the blind.  How we made the DeskSpace Lunar Surface The process of creating the DeskSpace Lunar Surface involves a lengthy process of casting, curing, finishing and CNC machining. Our craftsmen then carefully clean up the intricate lunar surface and then assemble each piece. The process may be lengthy, but we know that perfection only comes with time.   The process is as follows: 
We create a detailed 3D CAD model using NASA data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter
We make 1:1 masters in tool grade steel for both the 100mm desktop and 180mm wall versions.
After the master has been precision machined, the top surface is then sandblasted to create the perfect texture for the concrete to capture in each impression.
Moulds are then made from the master which will be used to cast each piece.
The concrete is mixed in small batches from a combination of Portland cement and aggregates to carefully control the amount of bubbles produced during the curing process.
Each piece is then cast using the freshly mixed jewellery grade concrete and allowed to set.
Once fully hardened each piece is carefully removed from the mould and sent for further processing to ensure all the edges are smoothed and details come out perfectly.
Every cement piece is then inspected and carefully packaged as it awaits final assembly.
Each metal base is machined using hardened Tungsten tipped cutting tools, then sent for anodizing to give it a deep Space Grey finish.
The DeskSpace mirror finish logo is added using a special process where the whole face is polished, the logo then masked before the rest of the surfaces are sandblasted to a smooth matte finish.
The final step comes by assembling the concrete impression of the lunar surface with the anodized metal base, held securely with an epoxy-based adhesive.
The final parts are then handed over to be precisely packaged in the gift box with the other accessories.

Thank You for viewing our site. We appreciate your interest. We are asking for your help to make our new system one step closer to reality to help bring water conservation to the forefront of everyone's minds and get our new Water Watch System into every home and building in and outside of the USA. With your help we can start to save the USEPA's estimated ""1 Trillion"" gallons of water (yes,  with a ""T"") lost to ""Water Leaks"" inside US homes annually.  We hope you will help us reach our goal for this stage of our project of $100,000, so we will be one step closer to bringing our new system to the market, and if we surpass our goal, that would get us to the market that much quicker.  Our team is in place, and they are excited to get work !  
The Water Watch team thanks you in advance !!

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Présentation du projet</strong></h2>
<p>Coucou les potes !</p>
<p>Comme vous pouvez le voir, j'ai décidé de m'acheter un chien. Plus précisément, un caniche miniature que je nommerai Poule. L'année 2020 a été éprouvante pour tous et je ne fais pas exception. J'ai perdu mon emploi pendant la pandémie, j'ai perdu le procès contre mon agresseur, j'ai commencé un nouveau travail en plein COVID, j'ai fini ma première année universitaire en ligne, j'ai changé de majeure, etc. Bref, ce n'était pas mon année. J'ai senti le besoin de commencer une nouvelle étape dans ma vie. Cela faisait déjà plusieurs années que je parlais d'avoir un chien. J'ai d'ailleurs rempli les formulaires de Mira pour élever un chien, mais j'ai finalement décidé que ce serait trop déchirant de m'en séparer après un an. Après avoir perdu le procès cet été, j'ai reparlé de mon idée d'avoir un chien à mes parents. J'ai toujours aimé l'approche de la zoothérapie, mais c'est assez compliqué d'y avoir accès. J'ai fait beaucoup de recherches sur les races de chien et les bons éleveurs éthiques au Québec. Le caniche est parfait pour une vie en famille avec d'autres animaux et est un excellent compagnon. J'ai trouvé une éleveuse formidable qui semble assurément adorer ses petites bêtes. Poule est le nom que je voulais absolument pour mon chien, mais je ne sais pas pourquoi. En bref, Poule est né le 5 septembre et je vais l'avoir début novembre.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Mon objectif avec cette campagne</h2>
<p>Bien sûr, je connais les dépenses qui viennent avec l'achat d'un chien. Je ne me serais pas embarquée dans ce projet en n'ayant pas les fonds nécessaires de base. Le 2/3 des virements sont déjà payés et j'ai déjà acheté tout le nécessaire. Par contre, je demeure une étudiante à temps plein qui travaille à temps partiel.</p>
<p>En changeant de travail, j'ai suivi des formations sur la fabrication de produits comme des savons, des chandelles, des bombes de bain, etc. Je travaille chez Coop Coco depuis plusieurs mois déjà et je côtoie des professeurs, des chimistes et des experts en la matière. J'ai donc décidé de mettre mon savoir à l'ouvrage cet été et j'ai commencé à fabriquer de nombreux produits. Je suis rendue assez aisée dans la fabrication et je veux donc profiter de mes apprentissages pour vendre ces produits pour dorloter Poule plus aisément. J'en ai offert plusieurs à mes amis proches et à ma famille et plusieurs ont tellement aimé qu'ils m'ont donné l'idée de les vendre. Mon objectif est d'amasser au moins 900$ en 35 jours et de vous faire profiter de ces petits trésors faits main, d'ingrédients naturels (vous trouverez la liste ci-dessous) et de recettes longuement recherchées et améliorées. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Impact de votre contribution et infos supplémentaires</h3>
<p>Cette nouvelle étape de ma vie me rend déjà immensément heureuse et comblée, et mon toutou n'est même pas encore arrivé ! </p>
<p>Votre contribution, peu importe le montant, vous gratifiera de ma gratitude éternelle. Aussi, c'est bientôt Noël ! Et puisqu’avec la COVID, il ne sera pas bien bien facile de magasiner, pourquoi ne pas gâter vos proches avec des produits faits maison par votre chère Zoé ??</p>
<p>Si vous ne pouvez pas contribuer, ce n'est vraiment pas grave. Je vous aime tous et toutes quand même !!!</p>
<p>P.S. Lorsque vous achetez plusieurs produits et que vous voulez des senteurs / couleurs / saveurs différentes pour chaque produit et que vous n'en avez pas l'option, veuillez m'écrire (ou à ma mère).  </p>
<p>P.P.S. Si vous voulez un paquet ""personnalisé"" veuillez communiquer avec moi, ça me fera plaisiiiiiiir de créer des ""Perks"" à votre nom. </p>
<p>P.P.P.S. Tous les produits sont garantis ""Satisfaction Zoé"", je vais donc remplacer n'importe quel produit qui ne ""fonctionne"" pas. Les petits défauts sont normaux, mais s'ils empêchent la bonne utilisation du produit, écrivez-moi, je vous en prie. </p>

<h3>Japanese Artisan Tableware at a Reasonable Price</h3>
<p>There has always been a strong demand for Japanese artisan pottery overseas. But, exporting large variety yet small quantity of products is difficult and the prices tend to shoot up. We have been looking into this issue, and have come up with the idea of using crowdfunding. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488449168/nygjb0wnlgieymoabyhl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>​We guarantee that all the prices are exactly the same as in Japan, just with an international shipping fee. This is our first challenge, and we would like to continue to introduce more artisans if we could make this happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We are a Tokyo based tableware store, named “<a href=""https://washoku.guide/to/hanada/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hanada</a>”. Since 1976, we have been working with 300 artisans from all over Japan. We are dedicated to producing all hand-crafted and unique products in which you can sense the artisans’ intention and expertise.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Perfect for Your Sake or Tea Party</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489160076/u9vraz6gbacsyentkz9o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In Japan, people gather under the cherry blossom to celebrate the spring with delicious drinks and food. Inspired by the culture, our sets will also make your party enjoyable and memorable.</p>
<p>We are collaborating with five contemporary potters, all of whom are highly skilled, and their professional careers span 15 to 40 years.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Cups and Decanters</h3>
<p>Our cups and decanters are made by Kazuhiko Kudo. His work actually starts with digging clay by himself. The clay was originally yellow sand flown from Siberia 45 thousand years ago, and was a soil of 200 million years old.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487838702/zf0pxmioic6r8dh5ad4y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A katakuchi decanter is a bowl with a spout on one side. It works perfectly when serving sake or matcha tea with several people. It can be used to serve both food and drink.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487838733/rwzkc76k7rzctduury6f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There are not many drinks in the world that can be enjoyed in such a diverse range of cups as Japanese sake or matcha green tea. These tableware are the fruits of our ancestors’ wisdom of enjoying the taste as deliciously as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>The dimensions of the cup:  2.3"" L x 2.3"" W x 3.2"" H  (5.7cm L x 5.7cm W x 8cm H)</li>
<li>The dimensions of the decanter:   7.2"" L x 5.3"" W x 3.5"" H (18.5cm L × 13.5cm W × 9cm H)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a film we have made in order to demonstrate the care in which each piece is created.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/TjmWllmhN34?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3>Platters</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487827500/fedlyw5yntkt5tthqf69.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Platters are made by Yuichi Yukinoura. He uses local apple trees for his original ash glaze. He applies four layers of glaze, and they turn into the beautiful glassy colors during the firing process.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487827528/ofm51lzj23os1l2xdixh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>He intentionally fires to make small cracks in the glaze, which is a technique called “Kannyu”, and it enhances and deepens the color.</p>
<ul><li>The dimensions of the platter:   11"" L x 7.5"" W x 0.6"" H (28cm L × 19cm W × 1.5cm H)  </li></ul>
<h3>Shallow Bowls</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487827600/ujonw6kt2pmfofrspzuo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Shallow petal bowls are made by Haruya Abe, and come in three colors as a set. Abe’s works are known for being particularly detailed and intricate.</p>
<ul><li>The dimensions of the plate:   6"" L x 6"" W x 1.6"" H (15cm L × 15cm W × 4cm H)  </li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487838764/jedpgui7t2xq6x67bbi8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Abe has come to be somewhat of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/abe_haruya/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">an Instagram celebrity</a>, after releasing the footage of himself making his pottery. Here is a film we have made about him. Please note that we have changed the style of the bowls since this video was recorded. But the final products are made by the same artisan with the same care.</p>

<h3>Hand-Painted Plate</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488447550/lid1y4dc876gb5xvlaoi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hand-painted plate is made by Mansaku Nakao. He started his career as a Japanese traditional kimono designer, but turned into a potter. His painting has been characterised by its sophisticated style over his 40 years of career, and this “spreading flower” motif is one of his trademark.  </p>
<ul><li>The dimensions of the plate:   6.3"" L x 6.3"" W x 1.6"" H (16cm L × 16cm W × 4cm H)  </li></ul>
<h3>Chopstick Rests</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487828516/y9rp7xm84pahiv48zaok.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Chopstick rests are made by Hirohisa Ogawa. He has reproduced the shape and color of cherry blossom petals after numerous experiments. The set of five petals is a perfect gift to deliver spring blossoms to a friend or your loved-one.</p>
<ul><li>The dimensions of each :   2"" L x 1.4"" W x 0.22"" H (5cm L × 3.5cm W × 0.6cm H)  </li></ul>
<div>Well made pottery will last you a lifetime (and longer), and with continued use, they will develop a unique texture and make people feel attached to them.</div>

</div></div>","Japanese Artisan Tableware at a Reasonable Price
There has always been a strong demand for Japanese artisan pottery overseas. But, exporting large variety yet small quantity of products is difficult and the prices tend to shoot up. We have been looking into this issue, and have come up with the idea of using crowdfunding. 

​We guarantee that all the prices are exactly the same as in Japan, just with an international shipping fee. This is our first challenge, and we would like to continue to introduce more artisans if we could make this happen.

About Us
We are a Tokyo based tableware store, named “Hanada”. Since 1976, we have been working with 300 artisans from all over Japan. We are dedicated to producing all hand-crafted and unique products in which you can sense the artisans’ intention and expertise.

Perfect for Your Sake or Tea Party

In Japan, people gather under the cherry blossom to celebrate the spring with delicious drinks and food. Inspired by the culture, our sets will also make your party enjoyable and memorable.
We are collaborating with five contemporary potters, all of whom are highly skilled, and their professional careers span 15 to 40 years.

Cups and Decanters
Our cups and decanters are made by Kazuhiko Kudo. His work actually starts with digging clay by himself. The clay was originally yellow sand flown from Siberia 45 thousand years ago, and was a soil of 200 million years old.  

A katakuchi decanter is a bowl with a spout on one side. It works perfectly when serving sake or matcha tea with several people. It can be used to serve both food and drink.

There are not many drinks in the world that can be enjoyed in such a diverse range of cups as Japanese sake or matcha green tea. These tableware are the fruits of our ancestors’ wisdom of enjoying the taste as deliciously as possible.

The dimensions of the cup:  2.3"" L x 2.3"" W x 3.2"" H  (5.7cm L x 5.7cm W x 8cm H)
The dimensions of the decanter:   7.2"" L x 5.3"" W x 3.5"" H (18.5cm L × 13.5cm W × 9cm H)  

Here is a film we have made in order to demonstrate the care in which each piece is created.

Platters

Platters are made by Yuichi Yukinoura. He uses local apple trees for his original ash glaze. He applies four layers of glaze, and they turn into the beautiful glassy colors during the firing process.

He intentionally fires to make small cracks in the glaze, which is a technique called “Kannyu”, and it enhances and deepens the color.
The dimensions of the platter:   11"" L x 7.5"" W x 0.6"" H (28cm L × 19cm W × 1.5cm H)  
Shallow Bowls

Shallow petal bowls are made by Haruya Abe, and come in three colors as a set. Abe’s works are known for being particularly detailed and intricate.
The dimensions of the plate:   6"" L x 6"" W x 1.6"" H (15cm L × 15cm W × 4cm H)  

Abe has come to be somewhat of an Instagram celebrity, after releasing the footage of himself making his pottery. Here is a film we have made about him. Please note that we have changed the style of the bowls since this video was recorded. But the final products are made by the same artisan with the same care.

 
Hand-Painted Plate

Hand-painted plate is made by Mansaku Nakao. He started his career as a Japanese traditional kimono designer, but turned into a potter. His painting has been characterised by its sophisticated style over his 40 years of career, and this “spreading flower” motif is one of his trademark.  
The dimensions of the plate:   6.3"" L x 6.3"" W x 1.6"" H (16cm L × 16cm W × 4cm H)  
Chopstick Rests

Chopstick rests are made by Hirohisa Ogawa. He has reproduced the shape and color of cherry blossom petals after numerous experiments. The set of five petals is a perfect gift to deliver spring blossoms to a friend or your loved-one.
The dimensions of each :   2"" L x 1.4"" W x 0.22"" H (5cm L × 3.5cm W × 0.6cm H)  
Well made pottery will last you a lifetime (and longer), and with continued use, they will develop a unique texture and make people feel attached to them.

HD Mask Noir is a military-grade security camera that records 1080p HD video & crystal clear audio 24/7 with no battery necessary. All you have to do is plug it in and connect to WiFi and you’ll have peace of mind knowing you can:With no batteries, no fees, and no wires, the HD Mask Noir is both the most advanced security camera on the market and the simplest to use.  Ultra-compact and super discreet, no one will know the HD Mask Noir is a camera unless you want them to. Plug it in anywhere — as if you simply needed to charge your phone — and start recording HD video instantly.The USB Charger Security Camera that goes unnoticed.Treat it like your charger and no one will know the difference. Keep it in your pocket, bag, or briefcase to bring the power of military-grade security wherever you go.Perfect to keep an eye on any room in the home or office.HD Mask Noir doesn’t just look like a charger — it is a charger.A USB port ensures no one will remove the camera from the wall because they need to charge their phone or tablet. It also provides a convenient excuse to keep one in every room.Works perfectly as a charger and as a security camera. Discreet and Functional.HD Mask Noir plugs directly into the wall and therefore needs no wires and no battery. Once plugged in, it goes to work instantly and will not turn off or die due to lack of power.Easy to Install and SetupA 75˚ wide-angle lens ensures that you’ll only need one HD Mask camera to capture all the action in nearly any room or office. With a near-panoramic view, you’ll be able to track the movement of anyone from the time they enter the space to when they leave — as well as everything that happens in between.For large dining rooms, conference rooms, or waiting rooms, place a camera on each side of the space for complete coverage from every angle.Panoramic viewing angle means you cover an entire room with just one camera. Actual Camera FootageLocal StorageThe HD Mask Noir can store up to 128 GB of video on a removable SD card inserted just above the plug (invisible when the camera is rolling). This important failsafe protects your footage and ensures that your camera keeps recording even if the WiFi or phone connection fails. Your security camera won’t do much good if it can only detect activity for half the day. HD Mask Noir’s camera is military-grade equipment designed to see clearly in a wide range of bright and dim light conditions. Protect yourself against break-ins at night and safeguard your workplace after the staff have gone home.According to the Department of Justice, most violent crimes happen at night. Whether you’re in the same location as your HD Mask Noir or not, video footage will keep you and what you hold dear safer when the sun goes down.Actual Camera FootageBuying from manufacturers like us directly on Indiegogo makes things much cheaper than buying through traditional retailers.

On the smartphone or computer installed application which allows every citizen to work in real time with Global map of interaction. The card has many layers: the social, political, economic, entertainment, medicine, education, etc., which in turn have their own sublayers. A citizen has the opportunity to inform the community about their attitude to the object or situation, intentions or plans for future actions by placing on the map with the beacon message.

<div>Hi there, we are Trish &amp; Elise: two mom’s who have teamed up to bring you a new and exclusively on-line Christian gift store.  We are aware of the many smaller towns and rural areas across Canada where people don’t have access to a Christian gift store without having to travel a distance to a city store. We are excited to offer you the convenience of on-line shopping with the ability to ship anywhere in Canada!  
<p>We will be offering a full and unique selection of Christian gift items, books, music and more.  In a special section of our website, we will offer gift boxes: we will put together gift items for various gift-giving occasions, and they will be beautifully packaged to make gift selecting and gift giving easy! We will ship your gift with your personal message directly to your gift recipient!</p>
<h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE! </h3>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds by means of a pre-sale so that we can start out our store with a great selection of products for you to choose from.  You can support us by checking out the items we have listed as “perks”.  Buy something for yourself, and/or send a gift to a friend (just let us know in the comment section who you want to send the item you’ve selected to with their address and a personal note we will attach). Please note that all perk prices include HST and shipping.</p>
<p>You can also help us by spreading the word, (so we can help you “spread <em>the Word</em>!” each time you send a gift). </p>
<p>Please tell anyone and everyone you know about this campaign, our website <a href=""http://www.underhisgrace.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.underhisgrace.ca</a> and our facebook page: Under His Grace On-line Christian Store.  Both of us have prior experience in retail, and know well that “word of mouth” is the best advertising, and with social media today, it’s like word of mouth with a megaphone!  Thank-you for sharing our info with anyone you think will ever have the occasion to buy a gift for a christening or baptism, wedding, anniversary, get well or encouragement or any other gift giving occasion. </p>
<h3>Our mission is to make available God’s Word in gift form.</h3>
<p>Special occasions or thinking-of-you moments are gift-giving moments.  The most meaningful gifts we can give are gifts that help lead others into a relationship with Christ.  We have both been blessed and touched by gifts given to us which have spoken God’s truth into our hearts. It is our hope that through this store, many more hearts will be touched by the gift of God’s word. </p>
<p>We have set our goal at $11,000 as a statement of faith.  Hebrews chapter 11 is known as the “faith” chapter as it lists many of the thing that the great patriarchs of the Old Testament accomplished “by faith”.  We are two busy moms with lots of support from our families and “by faith” we are taking the steps God is leading us to in opening this store. We are offering God our all and trusting Him with the rest.</p>
<p>""You must each decide in your heart how much to give.  And don’t give reluctantly or in response to pressure. ‘For God loves a person who gives cheerfully’” (2 Cor. 9:7).</p>

<p><strong>ZeroWatt lamps -  light up your home without paying an electricity bills.</strong><br/><i>The world's most effective  luxury lights, with no measurable energy consumption. </i> </p>
<p>ZeroWatt is the world's first, high-efficiency lamp which consumes no measurable energy. With the ZeroWatt lamp, you can illuminate the most important areas in your home without paying for electricity. The technology is based on maximum increase efficiency (250lm/W, 2-3 times more effective than LED bulbs), and on the fact that a conventional wattmeter cannot measure very low, idle power less than 1 -3W (depending on the version of wattmeter). The lamps theoretically consume about 0.2W. Therefore, you can use between 5 and 15 of these lamps at home without recording any energy consumption, and the lighting corresponds to 80-240 candles.</p>
<p>ADDED LUXURY<br/>With this product, you can walk around the home when it's dark, and still see everything. You will not be blinded after switching on the main lights, and you are not in complete darkness when you switch them off. You don't need to mess around with turning switches on and off onw hundred times a day. Now, everyone can have the luxury of permanent lighting without any measurable energy consumption.</p>
<p>FOR USE ANYWHERE<br/>With these small lights, you do not need to switch on the main lights every time you are walking around your home. Wall lights can be mounted on wall with 2 wood screw, everywhere you need, on the stairs, into the hallway, the bathroom, the toilet, under cabinet. They come with either US or Euro plugs (for other plug use converter), and work on 100-240 volts. We have many designs: downlights, mini-panels, micro-panels, under-cabinet lights, wall lights, work table lamps, and pendant chandeliers, all with Zero-Watt technology to completely illuminate your home.  All of these new products will be probably on IndieGOGO during the next campaign.</p>
<p>SUSTAINABLE WORLD<br/>Our civilization is dependant on fossil fuels, but most of these resources will be gone in one to two decades, so this energy-efficient product will help prolong the time left for developing new sources of clean and cheap energy, such as our battery size Graviton Fusion Nuclear Reactor, based on new theoretical physics - Theory of Everything (we will need 10 years on research and developing, and possible generously funding).</p>
<p>Most people now know that excessive energy consumption is one of the causes of global warming and climate change, but real catastrophe will be end of fossil fuels. Scientists say that: ""After the end of fossil fuels, there will only be enough food for 20% of the world’s population."" We do not know how much time we have, but if we do not start to solve this problem today, it will be too late. As customers, we can vote every day. Our future depends on each one of us.</p>

<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are a couple with several years of experience working for large companies and setting up new businesses and projects. While we have been relentlessly concerned with the details throughout prototyping, finding the best materials and planning for production, there is always the chance that omnipresent Murphy guy may make an entrance with that law of his.</p>
<p>In the event that things don't go as planned, whether it's a delay in the manufacturing timeline, shipping date, or something else, we promise to communicate honestly with you and work around the clock until we correct the issue.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for any damages to mobile phones, such as dropped or cracked phones that may happen while putting your phone in Bagby. We ensure Bagby holds up to 2kg. It's designed to be durable and solid, but we cannot control how people put their phones inside a Bagby. Also, although we have tested many surfaces, our hook might leave some marks if your door or wall paint is too old or of low quality.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

It's made slowly and with love. Bagby is made of quality materials: - EXTERIOR: Although the first samples were made in ""arpillera"" (burlap), we decided to use ""símil arpillera"", a similar material to burlap that is more solid and durable. - INTERIOR: The inside is made of premium cotton with a very soft texture.
2- Bagby is a non-tech solution. Our positioning is clear, LESS technology is MORE. No apps, no fancy tech tricks.  This is our way to fight smartphone addiction. 3- Bagby has a rustic look and fits in any home. Bagby is above all a cute home-decor product. You will love it! 4- Bagby works as a great reminder for your ""phone-free ritual"" before you enter the bedroom or any other room. Bagby will be the last thing you see when entering the room and trust us, that's helps! 5- Bagby is the result of a primary market research to overcome the three main barriers we have to embrace a phone-free time.

Risks & Challenges
We are a couple with several years of experience working for large companies and setting up new businesses and projects. While we have been relentlessly concerned with the details throughout prototyping, finding the best materials and planning for production, there is always the chance that omnipresent Murphy guy may make an entrance with that law of his.
In the event that things don't go as planned, whether it's a delay in the manufacturing timeline, shipping date, or something else, we promise to communicate honestly with you and work around the clock until we correct the issue.
We are not responsible for any damages to mobile phones, such as dropped or cracked phones that may happen while putting your phone in Bagby. We ensure Bagby holds up to 2kg. It's designed to be durable and solid, but we cannot control how people put their phones inside a Bagby. Also, although we have tested many surfaces, our hook might leave some marks if your door or wall paint is too old or of low quality.

  Like many of you, we are inspired by our children; meet Dec and Coop! We invented Toddler Monitor because we needed it for our families. We worried about traveling with our kids to places with pools or lakes, leaving our kids with family members, and were constantly checking to make sure our kids were safe in their beds. Our vision is: We want to keep kids safe, and we know we can do this by making Toddler Monitor available to families just like us. We started this journey over a year ago and have put our hearts, souls, time and money into making Toddler Monitor a reality.   For the last year, we have worked to complete product design, engineering and manufacturing setup with minimal funding but now we need your help to bring Toddler Monitor to life! Initially, we worked to create our proof of concept and show how we believed the Toddler Monitor should work.  We also talked a lot about how we wanted our product to look; we knew we wanted it to be fun and friendly, we also knew we wanted him to be durable and made of a soft material.Our proof of concept - a real beauty... Once we understood our requirements, we engaged Design1st, an Ottawa based firm that supports the design process from concept through to manufacturing and commercialization. We traveled to meet them in September to kick-off the project and have been working with them ever since to understand the user experience, create DECCO and the app.  The arrival of our 4th child, our 3D printed DECCO the Toddler Monitor...We now have a working prototype and app, that we are continuing to refine. With your support, we will be able to fund and manufacture our first run of product and get it into the hands of families all over North America! We plan to travel to China this summer to visit the factory and see the first run of DECCOs and ensure that it meets our exact specifications.            Also see our coverage on Mashable!  and on CTV News! We have been so thankful for the support that has brought us to this point. Thank you to all of our team members and partners!",22.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><strong><span>THE TUMBLER</span><br/></strong></strong>We designed this amazing insulated coffee and tea tumbler for several great reasons:<br/>1.

Can’t I scan and voice record with my mobile phone?</strong><br/>A: From the earliest days of hiku, we set out to make a product that was instant so it would satisfy the demands of a busy family.

With hiku you press one button and you're done, it's always handy, and anyone in the family can use it. </p><p><strong>Q: How do you charge it? How long does the battery last? </strong><br/>A: hiku uses a standard micro-USB connection like the ones found with many popular electronics today for charging.

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>How it works</strong></h3>
<p>A powerful magnet is housed securely in the body of the hook. The moving part contains iron and is attracted to the magnet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To open simply push near where the two tips meet. This is easy to do even it you can’t see the snap. The moving part quickly closes and is held in place by the magnet. The MagneClip® is strong and cannot be pulled open.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The MagneClip® is easy to keep open. Because the magnetic force is at a minimum when the snap hook is fully open there is just enough force to gently close it.  </p>
<p>If you need extra time to find the D ring on your dogs collar it won’t strain your hands and it won’t leave painful dimples in your thumb.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our first shipment just arrived in the US. We have a small amount of medium leashes available to the first few sponsors.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why we need your help</h2>
<p>We need to place a large order so we have stock on hand to sell to retailers. Our lead time with shipping can be up to 3 months. Retailers don't want to wait for stock to arrive, they are in business to sell and will drop unreliable vendors.</p>
<p>Stocking thousands of products in a warehouse costs money. Everytime we add a design or new product we have to buy stock.</p>
<p>We are going to print our new design hang tags for retail stores. We have a minimum order to the printers and we will store them at the factory to speed up delivery times.</p>
<p>We want to make a larger MagneClip® Ease so that the very largest therapy dogs can use them. The larger size will be used for 1"" leashes and will be just as easy to use for disabled people.</p>
<p>We are about to launch another product. It is still being developed but tooling costs will be around $3,000. The utility patents have already been filed in the USA but more countries need to be added as cash flow improves.</p>
<h2>I like to help but don't need a MagneClip®</h2>
<p>Please help us by passing on this link to all your friends. Email it or post in on your facebook page.</p>
<p>Drop into your nearest DIY or pet supply store and ask for products that have MagneClips on them. </p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p>Q How strong are they?</p>
<p>A The small MagneClip® can hold around 250 lbs. For dogs that means up to 35 lb dog.</p>
<p>The medium holds 570 lbs. for dogs that means 80 lbs.</p>
<p>Q Any dangers of using magnets.</p>
<p>A Magnets should not be swallowed. They will be attracted to each other and get stuck in the intestines. So please don't let children play with them.</p>
<p>Q Is the MagneClip® Ease good for all dogs?</p>
<p>A The MagneClip® Ease is designed to be easy to use. It is very good for anyone that has problems with movement with their hands and thumbs. They are perfect for guide dogs, seeing eye dogs or therapy animals. They are not recommended for young rambunctious, or any dogs that are nervous in traffic or easily lunges at other animals.</p>
<p>Q Aything else I should be concerned about</p>
<p>A Please don't use these for rock climbing. Specilzed carabineers are the only equiptment you should use.</p>
<p>Q What is your next product? </p>
<p>A Our next product is MagneClip® Secure. This is a development of our current Ease model and will be recommneded for young dogs that need extra security. They will be stronger and will not open as easily. They have a locking feature.</p>
<p>Q Will I be able to buy on line or at a retail store.</p>
<p>A We hope so. With your support we will be in both retail and on line stores soon. Please ask for us by name.</p>

We wanted the system to provide complete security.
We wanted it to be dead simple to install and operate. 
And we wanted it to be very affordable. 

  When it comes to personal security, every one of us has our own view about what we need in a home security system…
Whether it is a simple way to view surveillance video from your living room, foyer, front door or backyard, on any device. Anytime.  From anywhere. 
Whether you want to be notified through a text, an image, or to view live video from your house.
Do you want to be able to check in on an empty house, your pets, your kids arriving home from school, the babysitter watching your child?
