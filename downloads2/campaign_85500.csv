</h4>
<p>Hi, everyone! We’re Softly, Dear. We’re a five-piece band
from Eau Claire, WI and we've been making music together for almost two years
now. Our full names are Alexander Edward Adkinson, Joshua David Frederick,
Tyler David Hart, Benjamin James Possi and Adelyn Rose Strei. And hey, guess
what? <b>We’re making a full-length album!</b></p>
<p>There is a lot to this story, and we’ll get to the finer
details shortly, but perhaps the most important thing for you to know right now
(hopefully you’ve watched the video above by this point) is that we have
finished recording the album, we are incredibly happy with it so far, and we
cannot wait to share it with you! <br/></p><h4>Why We Need Your Help<br/>
</h4>
While recording of the album is complete, two vital steps remain before we
can call it a finished product: mixing and mastering. Recording, itself, is
obviously the biggest step in the process, but mixing and mastering are far
from simple or inexpensive procedures. The making of a professional-quality
studio album is a difficult thing for anyone—let alone a handful of college-aged
folks like us—to finance. So, we are asking for your help. <b>Our donation
goal of $3000 will pay for the recording, mixing, mastering, and release of this album—our first full-length effort.</b> We hope to raise the
necessary funds by July 13 and then take our finished product with us as we
embark on a tour to the East Coast and back this coming August with our friends
<a href=""http://adelynrose.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Adelyn Rose</a>.<p></p>
<p>We are all very confident in the music we are making and we
fully believe that you will find worthwhile any donation you make to our cause!
We would greatly appreciate any and every form of assistance you can give us—be
it making a monetary donation (of <i>any</i> amount!), spreading the
word and showing this page to your family and friends, or both! Not only will
you receive the satisfaction of being able to help us achieve our musical
goals; you will also, if you decide to donate <i>any</i> amount of
money, receive a reward from us at the end of this campaign. The rewards, listed on the right-hand side of this page, range
from digital downloads of our single (currently streaming at the green link below) to physical copies of the album to private shows and everything in between!</p>
<p>We have been incredibly lucky to grow together as a band the
way we have over the last two years. And we’ve been even luckier to be able to
do so in such an amazing, nurturing community. Eau Claire, WI is a truly
one-of-a-kind city—in our case, it’s an incredible place in which to create and
witness art of all kinds. In our time here (especially this past year, during which we hosted and attended a great number of house shows), we have been witness to an amazing music &amp; arts community that is overflowing with talent, enthusiasm, creativity, and kindness. This community (which includes you!) has welcomed,
supported, and shaped us as a band. We are continually inspired by our fellow
artists and endlessly thankful for all those who support us. We consider every
piece of music that we release, therefore, as belonging just as much to the
community—to you—as it does to us. And that will be especially true of this
album if this campaign succeeds! Thanks so much for reading. We hope you will
consider helping us reach our goal!<br/><br/><a href=""softlydear.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">*** For a small taste of the album, you can stream its first single, ""Things I Say"" right here!

</p><p>After a successful self-release of our debut EP, <i><a href=""http://softlydear.bandcamp.com/album/portico"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Portico</a></i>, in
June of last year, we naturally got back to work writing more songs. We took a
very relaxed approach, however, as we figured it would probably take quite some
time for a new batch of material to be born and to grow into a collection that we
would be ready to record. As we took our time, we found that as usual, ideas slowly came to us from just about everywhere. It could start with an
interesting snippet of a 45-minute-long improvised group jam; with a unique—or
simply catchy—guitar, piano, vocal or bass line; with a drum pattern that
caught our ears; or with an interesting melody, chord progression or set of
lyrics that one of us stumbled upon alone in our room late at night. Some of
the songs that came to us were also inspired by moments on tour as a band and
by road trips we’ve taken across the country as friends. If there’s one thing
we’ve learned, it’s that there is really no such thing as that perfect
songwriting “method” or “formula"". And as five people who are all extremely
interested in the art of songwriting, the concept that there is no formula is
exciting, because it opens up all sorts of possibilities for fresh, interesting
ideas in music. </p>
<p>By the time this past winter began its slow departure, we had
piled up quite a few ideas of our own. They were mostly loose song structures
that had come to us in different ways and at different times throughout the
year. We even dug up some old songs that some of us had written on our own a
long time ago and put those on the table as tunes that had potential for a band
arrangement and inclusion on a new album. After we considered all of our half-finished songs, we chose some of our favorites and got to
work on adding more sections, parts for other instruments, and rounding out all
the rough edges. We worked hard on our arrangements and we did so as a unit.
After a few weeks of getting together to workshop the tunes nearly every day,
we knew that we would be ready to record them soon. So, we booked a full week
of studio time out at <a href=""http://www.pinehollowaudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pine Hollow Audio</a> in Eau Claire, WI with talented
engineer and producer, Evan Middlesworth. We worked with Evan in 2013 on our
debut EP, <i>Portico</i>, and we could not have been happier with that experience.
Ever since then, he has been our “go-to guy”, and we have been fortunate enough
to get to know him quite well as a friend, too (which makes the studio
experience that much more special). <br/><br/></p><h4>Off to Pine Hollow!</h4><p></p>
<p>When our recording time finally came, on April 7th, we were
beyond excited to be back at Pine Hollow. We consider ourselves lucky folks
every time we get the chance to be there, but we knew that these particular
sessions were going to be really special. When we tracked Portico last year, we
did it over a course of months, sporadically booking studio time for the few
weekends that we were all available from January to April. This time, however,
we did all of the recording in one eight-day period (April 7th-14th). Having
made all the necessary arrangements with work and school, we had no other major
obligations that week. As a result, we were able to fully immerse ourselves in
the studio experience; all we had to do was focus on the music. And we feel
that the “all-at-once” approach to recording suited us extremely well. From day
one, there was an amazing sense of focus. We tweaked arrangements, finalized
string and horn parts, and welcomed studio experimentation. The more we
recorded, the more our eclectic batch of songs, in spite of all the differences
between them, started to feel like one cohesive creation. </p>
<p>And now that we have finished recording the album, we can say
with confidence that it does, indeed, possess a cohesive sound. It is certainly
no coincidence, either, that we consider many of these songs to be some of our
most collaborative work to-date. The cohesion between songs, therefore, is not
so much a result of stylistic consistency (although there is a decent amount of
that) as it is a result of the same five minds coming together to work
creatively as a team—a single unit—on each of the tunes. And that is something
that we feel is really special about being in a band. At its best, the
democratic approach to arranging songs naturally combines the strengths,
influences, and personalities of each individual group member and results in
finished products that are truly unique and serve to highlight what is possible
via collective and cooperative creativity. Our album is not for us to judge,
but we hope that it can serve as a good example of this kind of approach to
music making in action. <br/><br/></p><h4>With A Little Help From Our Friends...</h4><p></p>
<p>Recording this album was an incredible experience for us, but it
would not have been possible without the help of certain people outside of the
band. The aforementioned Evan Middlesworth, our engineer and co-producer, played an invaluable role
in helping us achieve what we wanted with these songs. Our creative
relationship with him has always been healthy and positive, and we feel
extremely fortunate to have found a partner in someone like him so early in our
“band career.” Not only does he possess incredible knowledge of sound and
recording techniques (he studied Sound Design &amp; Composition at Purdue
University); his taste in music and production also aligns quite well with our
own. What’s more is that he seems to know exactly where we’re trying to go with
every song that we bring to the table. In light of all this, it only made sense
to bring Evan on as a co-producer of this album. Being “co-producer” meant that
in addition to overseeing the “technical stuff” involved with recording and
engineering (microphones, recording software, all those dreaded cables), Evan
also involved himself in the song arrangements themselves, occasionally suggesting certain ways of tweaking or adding to the tunes and being there if we needed him as we figured out how
exactly we wanted our songs to unfold. Evan even made appearances on this
album, playing lap steel guitar on two songs and helping with background vocals
on two others. We cannot overstate how appreciative we are of Evan’s talent and
guidance. </p>
<p>In addition to the help we received from Evan, we also received
some crucial assistance from a handful of incredibly talented UW-Eau Claire
musicians. Kris Bergh (trumpet), Hannah Kennedy (violin), Colin Marusek
(trombone), Joe Niemann (trumpet) and Laura Severson (viola) all graciously
agreed to take time out of their hectic schedules, come out to Pine Hollow, and
play the string and horn parts that we had written for some of our songs. To
put it briefly, the talent that these musicians exhibited when they came into
the studio blew us away. Folks, it is no secret that the Chippewa Valley is
host to an amazing amount of high-caliber musicians. But in case you ever
forget that, these string and horn players (along with our own Addie Strei, who
played saxophone and flute on a few of these songs) will be there to remind you of that fact
whenever you happen to listen to our album. In short, we are extraordinarily
thankful for their contributions to our songs and we cannot wait for you all to
hear their wonderful playing!<br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/664348/files/20140621022132-softly_dear_house_of_rock_2.jpg?1403342492"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Breakdown of Costs<br/>

What We're Up To

Hi, everyone! We’re Softly, Dear. We’re a five-piece band
from Eau Claire, WI and we've been making music together for almost two years
now. Our full names are Alexander Edward Adkinson, Joshua David Frederick,
Tyler David Hart, Benjamin James Possi and Adelyn Rose Strei. And hey, guess
what? We’re making a full-length album!
There is a lot to this story, and we’ll get to the finer
details shortly, but perhaps the most important thing for you to know right now
(hopefully you’ve watched the video above by this point) is that we have
finished recording the album, we are incredibly happy with it so far, and we
cannot wait to share it with you! Why We Need Your Help

While recording of the album is complete, two vital steps remain before we
can call it a finished product: mixing and mastering. Recording, itself, is
obviously the biggest step in the process, but mixing and mastering are far
from simple or inexpensive procedures. The making of a professional-quality
studio album is a difficult thing for anyone—let alone a handful of college-aged
folks like us—to finance. So, we are asking for your help. Our donation
goal of $3000 will pay for the recording, mixing, mastering, and release of this album—our first full-length effort. We hope to raise the
necessary funds by July 13 and then take our finished product with us as we
embark on a tour to the East Coast and back this coming August with our friends
Adelyn Rose.
We are all very confident in the music we are making and we
fully believe that you will find worthwhile any donation you make to our cause!
We would greatly appreciate any and every form of assistance you can give us—be
it making a monetary donation (of any amount!), spreading the
word and showing this page to your family and friends, or both! Not only will
you receive the satisfaction of being able to help us achieve our musical
goals; you will also, if you decide to donate any amount of
money, receive a reward from us at the end of this campaign. The rewards, listed on the right-hand side of this page, range
from digital downloads of our single (currently streaming at the green link below) to physical copies of the album to private shows and everything in between!
We have been incredibly lucky to grow together as a band the
way we have over the last two years. And we’ve been even luckier to be able to
do so in such an amazing, nurturing community. Eau Claire, WI is a truly
one-of-a-kind city—in our case, it’s an incredible place in which to create and
witness art of all kinds. In our time here (especially this past year, during which we hosted and attended a great number of house shows), we have been witness to an amazing music & arts community that is overflowing with talent, enthusiasm, creativity, and kindness. This community (which includes you!) has welcomed,
supported, and shaped us as a band. We are continually inspired by our fellow
artists and endlessly thankful for all those who support us. We consider every
piece of music that we release, therefore, as belonging just as much to the
community—to you—as it does to us. And that will be especially true of this
album if this campaign succeeds! Thanks so much for reading. We hope you will
consider helping us reach our goal!*** For a small taste of the album, you can stream its first single, ""Things I Say"" right here! The song was mixed by Evan Middlesworth at Pine Hollow Audio and mastered by Brian Joseph (Bon Iver, Volcano Choir) at April Base.The Making of the Album
The Songwriting Process 
After a successful self-release of our debut EP, Portico, in
June of last year, we naturally got back to work writing more songs. We took a
very relaxed approach, however, as we figured it would probably take quite some
time for a new batch of material to be born and to grow into a collection that we
would be ready to record. As we took our time, we found that as usual, ideas slowly came to us from just about everywhere. It could start with an
interesting snippet of a 45-minute-long improvised group jam; with a unique—or
simply catchy—guitar, piano, vocal or bass line; with a drum pattern that
caught our ears; or with an interesting melody, chord progression or set of
lyrics that one of us stumbled upon alone in our room late at night. Some of
the songs that came to us were also inspired by moments on tour as a band and
by road trips we’ve taken across the country as friends. If there’s one thing
we’ve learned, it’s that there is really no such thing as that perfect
songwriting “method” or “formula"". And as five people who are all extremely
interested in the art of songwriting, the concept that there is no formula is
exciting, because it opens up all sorts of possibilities for fresh, interesting
ideas in music. 
By the time this past winter began its slow departure, we had
piled up quite a few ideas of our own. They were mostly loose song structures
that had come to us in different ways and at different times throughout the
year. We even dug up some old songs that some of us had written on our own a
long time ago and put those on the table as tunes that had potential for a band
arrangement and inclusion on a new album. After we considered all of our half-finished songs, we chose some of our favorites and got to
work on adding more sections, parts for other instruments, and rounding out all
the rough edges. We worked hard on our arrangements and we did so as a unit.
After a few weeks of getting together to workshop the tunes nearly every day,
we knew that we would be ready to record them soon. So, we booked a full week
of studio time out at Pine Hollow Audio in Eau Claire, WI with talented
engineer and producer, Evan Middlesworth. We worked with Evan in 2013 on our
debut EP, Portico, and we could not have been happier with that experience.
Ever since then, he has been our “go-to guy”, and we have been fortunate enough
to get to know him quite well as a friend, too (which makes the studio
experience that much more special). Off to Pine Hollow!
When our recording time finally came, on April 7th, we were
beyond excited to be back at Pine Hollow. We consider ourselves lucky folks
every time we get the chance to be there, but we knew that these particular
sessions were going to be really special. When we tracked Portico last year, we
did it over a course of months, sporadically booking studio time for the few
weekends that we were all available from January to April. This time, however,
we did all of the recording in one eight-day period (April 7th-14th). Having
made all the necessary arrangements with work and school, we had no other major
obligations that week. As a result, we were able to fully immerse ourselves in
the studio experience; all we had to do was focus on the music. And we feel
that the “all-at-once” approach to recording suited us extremely well. From day
one, there was an amazing sense of focus. We tweaked arrangements, finalized
string and horn parts, and welcomed studio experimentation. The more we
recorded, the more our eclectic batch of songs, in spite of all the differences
between them, started to feel like one cohesive creation. 
And now that we have finished recording the album, we can say
with confidence that it does, indeed, possess a cohesive sound. It is certainly
no coincidence, either, that we consider many of these songs to be some of our
most collaborative work to-date. The cohesion between songs, therefore, is not
so much a result of stylistic consistency (although there is a decent amount of
that) as it is a result of the same five minds coming together to work
creatively as a team—a single unit—on each of the tunes. And that is something
that we feel is really special about being in a band. At its best, the
democratic approach to arranging songs naturally combines the strengths,
influences, and personalities of each individual group member and results in
finished products that are truly unique and serve to highlight what is possible
via collective and cooperative creativity. Our album is not for us to judge,
but we hope that it can serve as a good example of this kind of approach to
music making in action. With A Little Help From Our Friends...
Recording this album was an incredible experience for us, but it
would not have been possible without the help of certain people outside of the
band. The aforementioned Evan Middlesworth, our engineer and co-producer, played an invaluable role
in helping us achieve what we wanted with these songs. Our creative
relationship with him has always been healthy and positive, and we feel
extremely fortunate to have found a partner in someone like him so early in our
“band career.” Not only does he possess incredible knowledge of sound and
recording techniques (he studied Sound Design & Composition at Purdue
University); his taste in music and production also aligns quite well with our
own. What’s more is that he seems to know exactly where we’re trying to go with
every song that we bring to the table. In light of all this, it only made sense
to bring Evan on as a co-producer of this album. Being “co-producer” meant that
in addition to overseeing the “technical stuff” involved with recording and
engineering (microphones, recording software, all those dreaded cables), Evan
also involved himself in the song arrangements themselves, occasionally suggesting certain ways of tweaking or adding to the tunes and being there if we needed him as we figured out how
exactly we wanted our songs to unfold. Evan even made appearances on this
album, playing lap steel guitar on two songs and helping with background vocals
on two others. We cannot overstate how appreciative we are of Evan’s talent and
guidance. 
In addition to the help we received from Evan, we also received
some crucial assistance from a handful of incredibly talented UW-Eau Claire
musicians. Kris Bergh (trumpet), Hannah Kennedy (violin), Colin Marusek
(trombone), Joe Niemann (trumpet) and Laura Severson (viola) all graciously
agreed to take time out of their hectic schedules, come out to Pine Hollow, and
play the string and horn parts that we had written for some of our songs. To
put it briefly, the talent that these musicians exhibited when they came into
the studio blew us away. Folks, it is no secret that the Chippewa Valley is
host to an amazing amount of high-caliber musicians. But in case you ever
forget that, these string and horn players (along with our own Addie Strei, who
played saxophone and flute on a few of these songs) will be there to remind you of that fact
whenever you happen to listen to our album. In short, we are extraordinarily
thankful for their contributions to our songs and we cannot wait for you all to
hear their wonderful playing!   Breakdown of Costs

For over a decade and a half, James worked as a college radio DJ on WTUL-FM, and as a music critic and journalist for the “College Music Journal,” the premier mouthpiece for college radio and so-called “Alternative music” of the 1990s. Being paid to professionally listen to bad new music in the late '90s proved to be such a bleak undertaking for him, that he decided to throw his own hat into the fray, and return to making his own original music.<br/><br/>Upon returning to New Orleans in 1998, James took up the guitar and piano again, and wrote a batch of songs, influenced only by the BEST of the best of what he had heard in his entire lifetime of loving and playing music. In this, he was especially influenced by his first love, the 1970s classic rock and power pop sounds of his older brother's record collection.<br/><br/>Friends and listeners at the time, made whispered comparisons in this music to Jeff Buckley, Big Star, Badfinger, John Lennon’s White Album period, the Raspberries, R.E.M., Gram Parsons, George Harrison, Brian Wilson, Roger McGuinn, Yo La Tengo, Liam Finn, Emmit Rhodes, and so forth.<br/><br/>Turning to his rhythm section friends Dave Baker and Elzy Lindsey, James formed a three piece band in 1998-1999, and took upon himself the Herculean task of producing and recording the major-scale album of his musical dreams, to suit his exhaustive sense of perfection. They may have played only a handful of gigs, but everyone who remembered this band spoke highly of them, and sensed the potential for greatness lurking somewhere in the music. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/523198/files/20140421133000-Mal12.jpg?1398112200"" src="""" style=""width: 200.692px; height: 267px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/523200/files/20140421133009-Mal07_-_Copy.jpg?1398112209"" src="""" style=""width: 269.586px; height: 392px;""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/523202/files/20140421133125-Mal13.jpg?1398112285"" src="""" style=""width: 181.471px; height: 276px;""/></p><br/><p></p><br/><h2><i><b>The Curse</b></i></h2><br/>But from the start, the new band was seemingly cursed; their troubles began practically from day one. Trapped in the netherworld between the demise of the old era of expensive recording studios and the dawn of the age of home bedroom digital recording, with a retro sound that hearkened back to the classic rock and power pop of the 1970s, there was really no place for this recording or this unique band to exist comfortably. Ahead of its time. Behind its time. Maybe a bit of both at the same time.<br/><br/>So the music patiently chose not to exist. Until now -- until YOU stepped in to help fund this ""lost"" album to be completed, and finally see the light of day!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/450018/files/20140321101805-Malcovermockup.jpg?1395422285"" src="""" style=""width: 297.078px; height: 316px;""/></p><h3>The Recording Odyssey 1999-2005</h3><br/>The album recording was commenced in New Orleans in spring of 1999. Upon completion of the basic bass and drum parts by Dave and Elzy, the tapes were then lugged around by James to a dizzying array of different recording studios, over a period of five years, in a desperate search for capturing the musical ideas that James was hearing in his head.<br/><br/>Principal recording and tracking was done with <b>Bruce Watson</b> at Fat Possum Records’ Money Shot studios in Mississippi; at the legendary Jimmy Ford Clinic in New Orleans; at Word of Mouth studios, Green Street Graveyard, Buzzy Beano’s, and probably a few other crazy, fly-by-night, hole-in-the-wall studio places we can’t even remember the names of.<br/><br/>After countless overdubs, retakes, recuts, studio tinkering and endless rough mixes, the album STILL lingered on only in fossil form, on the archaic format of ADAT digital tapes, and STILL it wasn't finished yet. But he kept going.<br/><br/>Money ran out several different times, leading to long lulls in activity. A fire in a rehearsal space claimed several guitars and the vintage Fender “Vibrotone” Leslie speaker cabinet, that was to be a central part of the album’s sound. Even worse, the notebook containing all of the albums lyrics, credits, track listings, and recording session details, was stolen from a Laundromat on Magazine Street.<br/><br/>The thing called 9/11 happened. Hurricane Katrina happened. The original tapes were copied, recopied, and copied yet again, they were so worn out from overdubbing. Three different guitar amps gave up the ghost and died, over the course of the album’s recording.<br/><br/>Justifiably, the other two members of the group began to scratch their heads and wonder, if James could ever finish the darn thing, or if anyone else would ever hear this music at all -- including themselves. They began to ponder other musical endeavors.<br/><br/>James’ endless chase of the sounds in his head, his refusal to compromise or cut corners or settle for anything less than EXACTLY what he was hearing in his musical vision, began to make this endlessly forthcoming ""debut"" album look like a fool’s errand, indeed.<br/><br/>As ADAT digital tape became even further obsolete and the machines vanished from professional recording studios (Hurricane Katrina killed off a great many of the machines locally), it seemed that all the recording time, money, blood, sweat and tears spent on this project, was lost and would all be in vain.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/450021/files/20140321101959-TapesSideView.jpg?1395422399"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><h4>The Unfinished Album</h4>Crushed by fate, overwhelmed by the tide, the project waned. Time moved on. A sequence of disasters and triumphs followed -- hurricanes like Katrina, RIta and Isaac, babies were born, medical mishaps, evictions, recording studios closed, people moved away, that crazy thing called LIFE happened, until the band and its tiny little unfinished album -- provisionally titled ""I Shall Throw Myself Over The Falls"" -- was just a dim memory.<br/><br/>These songs and tapes from this entire album have languished unheard and undiscovered, trapped in the obsolescence of outmoded technology and crushed dreams. A box of mysterious little ADAT tapes, that was lugged from place to place, even being spared from Katrina's floodwaters, yet becoming more and more  forlorn and distant with each successive apartment move.<br/><br/><p>It's almost completely there on the tapes. It's practically
done. <br/><br/>
Like an underground version of Brian Wilson's long-lost Smile LP, only James
knows what is on those tapes, but he swears to us it was very, VERY close to
fruition at the point where the project finally gave up the ghost and was
mothballed into suspended animation, almost a decade ago now. The money is
needed to turn something that no one can hear, into something we CAN all hear,
and listen to, and enjoy.  </p>
<p>This is a bare bones campaign to get this music living
again. We are not interested in wasting money on posters or radio promotion or
ridiculous ambitions to make expensive lavish videos or to tour the world. We
are all about the music here. <br/><br/>
Any money raised OVER and beyond the funding goal, will be used for paying for
rental, repair or purchasing of any musical instruments and last-minute
gear/equipment needed to completely finish the recording, for paying guest musicians
(and there are several to be paid), or for any additional help with recording
engineers, artwork, mastering, or other services we may run into down the line
on this project. And if there is anything left over at the end, it will go to
pay back the many previous engineers, guest musicians, technicians and many
recording studios who gave so  tirelessly of themselves and worked on this
shoestring budget project in the past  -- many of whom were sorely
underpaid for their time and effort on the six years of recording this album
back in 1999 to 2004. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Thank you for looking, and thanks for giving.</p>

For over a decade and a half, James worked as a college radio DJ on WTUL-FM, and as a music critic and journalist for the “College Music Journal,” the premier mouthpiece for college radio and so-called “Alternative music” of the 1990s. Being paid to professionally listen to bad new music in the late '90s proved to be such a bleak undertaking for him, that he decided to throw his own hat into the fray, and return to making his own original music.Upon returning to New Orleans in 1998, James took up the guitar and piano again, and wrote a batch of songs, influenced only by the BEST of the best of what he had heard in his entire lifetime of loving and playing music. In this, he was especially influenced by his first love, the 1970s classic rock and power pop sounds of his older brother's record collection.Friends and listeners at the time, made whispered comparisons in this music to Jeff Buckley, Big Star, Badfinger, John Lennon’s White Album period, the Raspberries, R.E.M., Gram Parsons, George Harrison, Brian Wilson, Roger McGuinn, Yo La Tengo, Liam Finn, Emmit Rhodes, and so forth.Turning to his rhythm section friends Dave Baker and Elzy Lindsey, James formed a three piece band in 1998-1999, and took upon himself the Herculean task of producing and recording the major-scale album of his musical dreams, to suit his exhaustive sense of perfection. They may have played only a handful of gigs, but everyone who remembered this band spoke highly of them, and sensed the potential for greatness lurking somewhere in the music. The CurseBut from the start, the new band was seemingly cursed; their troubles began practically from day one. Trapped in the netherworld between the demise of the old era of expensive recording studios and the dawn of the age of home bedroom digital recording, with a retro sound that hearkened back to the classic rock and power pop of the 1970s, there was really no place for this recording or this unique band to exist comfortably. Ahead of its time. Behind its time. Maybe a bit of both at the same time.So the music patiently chose not to exist. Until now -- until YOU stepped in to help fund this ""lost"" album to be completed, and finally see the light of day!The Recording Odyssey 1999-2005The album recording was commenced in New Orleans in spring of 1999. Upon completion of the basic bass and drum parts by Dave and Elzy, the tapes were then lugged around by James to a dizzying array of different recording studios, over a period of five years, in a desperate search for capturing the musical ideas that James was hearing in his head.Principal recording and tracking was done with Bruce Watson at Fat Possum Records’ Money Shot studios in Mississippi; at the legendary Jimmy Ford Clinic in New Orleans; at Word of Mouth studios, Green Street Graveyard, Buzzy Beano’s, and probably a few other crazy, fly-by-night, hole-in-the-wall studio places we can’t even remember the names of.After countless overdubs, retakes, recuts, studio tinkering and endless rough mixes, the album STILL lingered on only in fossil form, on the archaic format of ADAT digital tapes, and STILL it wasn't finished yet. But he kept going.Money ran out several different times, leading to long lulls in activity. A fire in a rehearsal space claimed several guitars and the vintage Fender “Vibrotone” Leslie speaker cabinet, that was to be a central part of the album’s sound. Even worse, the notebook containing all of the albums lyrics, credits, track listings, and recording session details, was stolen from a Laundromat on Magazine Street.The thing called 9/11 happened. Hurricane Katrina happened. The original tapes were copied, recopied, and copied yet again, they were so worn out from overdubbing. Three different guitar amps gave up the ghost and died, over the course of the album’s recording.Justifiably, the other two members of the group began to scratch their heads and wonder, if James could ever finish the darn thing, or if anyone else would ever hear this music at all -- including themselves. They began to ponder other musical endeavors.James’ endless chase of the sounds in his head, his refusal to compromise or cut corners or settle for anything less than EXACTLY what he was hearing in his musical vision, began to make this endlessly forthcoming ""debut"" album look like a fool’s errand, indeed.As ADAT digital tape became even further obsolete and the machines vanished from professional recording studios (Hurricane Katrina killed off a great many of the machines locally), it seemed that all the recording time, money, blood, sweat and tears spent on this project, was lost and would all be in vain.The Unfinished AlbumCrushed by fate, overwhelmed by the tide, the project waned. Time moved on. A sequence of disasters and triumphs followed -- hurricanes like Katrina, RIta and Isaac, babies were born, medical mishaps, evictions, recording studios closed, people moved away, that crazy thing called LIFE happened, until the band and its tiny little unfinished album -- provisionally titled ""I Shall Throw Myself Over The Falls"" -- was just a dim memory.These songs and tapes from this entire album have languished unheard and undiscovered, trapped in the obsolescence of outmoded technology and crushed dreams. A box of mysterious little ADAT tapes, that was lugged from place to place, even being spared from Katrina's floodwaters, yet becoming more and more  forlorn and distant with each successive apartment move.It's almost completely there on the tapes. It's practically
done. 
Like an underground version of Brian Wilson's long-lost Smile LP, only James
knows what is on those tapes, but he swears to us it was very, VERY close to
fruition at the point where the project finally gave up the ghost and was
mothballed into suspended animation, almost a decade ago now. The money is
needed to turn something that no one can hear, into something we CAN all hear,
and listen to, and enjoy.  
This is a bare bones campaign to get this music living
again. We are not interested in wasting money on posters or radio promotion or
ridiculous ambitions to make expensive lavish videos or to tour the world. We
are all about the music here. 
Any money raised OVER and beyond the funding goal, will be used for paying for
rental, repair or purchasing of any musical instruments and last-minute
gear/equipment needed to completely finish the recording, for paying guest musicians
(and there are several to be paid), or for any additional help with recording
engineers, artwork, mastering, or other services we may run into down the line
on this project. And if there is anything left over at the end, it will go to
pay back the many previous engineers, guest musicians, technicians and many
recording studios who gave so  tirelessly of themselves and worked on this
shoestring budget project in the past  -- many of whom were sorely
underpaid for their time and effort on the six years of recording this album
back in 1999 to 2004. Thank you for looking, and thanks for giving.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

The cast recordings of the historically inaccurate musical by Jared Corwin (book & lyrics), Jacob Minter (music & lyrics), and Gabriella Carr (additional material & original director).Our musical tells the story of Abraham Lincoln's homosexual affair with would-be assassin, John Wilkes Booth, while the sexually frustrated first lady Mary Todd Lincoln finds release in the arms of General Ulysses S. Grant. 
We are the creators of Gaybraham Lincoln: The Musical, a raunchy examination of some of the oldest prejudices through the skewed lens of a historical comedy.

This campaign is to create a quality cast album of the musical, utilizing a 15-piece orchestra (strings, brass, winds, and percussion)

These contributions will enable us to hire a full register of actors and musicians, and a professional studio in which to record them.
The recording will take place on April 13th, 2014 in Ithaca, New York

What We Need & What You GetRecording an album like this is no small task!
The bulk of the money will go to our musicians and recordists.  We intend to fully compensate all our performers, student and professional.  Funds will also be used to pay for studio time.  The cast album requires two recording sessions: one for the orchestra/choir, and one for the solo vocalists.  Funds will also pay for the mixing session(s) and any necessary equipment rentals, such as percussion instruments or specialized microphones.

If we fail to meet our goal, we will still record the album!  But unless we reach our goal, we will have to remove the orchestra and strip down to a piano/vocal album with some small instrumental additions, and depending on the amount of funding received, we may have to trim songs off of the recording process.
We have special perks for all of our contributors!  Shipping is NOT limited to the USA!Perks include:
Digital Downloads or CDs of the finished album
Autographed Gaybraham Materials
Album credits
DVD of the premiere performance

the rights to their music and have permission to do with it as they please.  Whether they shop their music around or not,
each song will be stitched and woven with elements of true authentic musicianship
and artistry that is far-reaching beyond our years.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our
band, <i>Gas Station Disco</i>, is one of
the top 10 best new Breakout bands according to Touchtunes, a ranking we
reached after the success of our latest record, ""Port and Starboard"".
The main reason of our success has always been our supportive fans; we wouldn’t
be where we are today without them, and we are eternally grateful for the
possibilities they’ve created for us as a band. We are now getting ready to move
ahead into a national tour, and we can’t do it without a reliable tour van. Our
hope is to raise money to purchase a tour van! </p>
<p><i>Gas Station Disco</i> was founded in 2010 in Pottsville, PA. Our
goal was to offer a new, special, simple type of music for our audience, who
kept giving us more reasons to live up to their expectations show after show.
Our fans are our main motivation, and we know they are the reason we’ve made it
as far as we have. Now we want to reach out to them, as well as new listeners,
to help us make the next step. There’s just one technical limitation holding us
back from fulfilling our destiny.</p>
<p><b>Why We Need Your Help</b></p>
<p>We
are seeking $10,000 to pay for a reliable tour van so that we can make it
around the country to play in more places than we’ve ever been able to before. The
truck we have now has served us well for years, but it’s given us everything it
has. A new van will be the investment we need to continue leveraging our
growing success as far as it can go. It could be the single defining factor
that makes the difference between our band making it big, or dying just before
we were really able to take off. We don’t want that to happen, and we want to
reward everyone who has supported our dreams along the way.</p>
<p>We’d
like to offer as many incentives as possible for those who are able to donate
the money we will need to make this happen. The funds gathered from this
campaign will be used to purchase one of the suitable vans we’ve already
scouted,and go towards letting the world know
that <i>Gas Station Disco</i> exists. We
view touring as the absolute best way to really get in touch with fans, and
reach out beyond the limits of just recordings of our music into the real world
of performance. The van is what will make that possible.  </p>
<p><b>Tell Your Friends</b></p>
<p>We’d like to serve as an
inspiration for other aspiring musicians to get out there and release their
music to the world through the crowdfunding model. We believe we’ve barely
tapped the surface of all the people who will love the music we bring into the
world, and our upcoming tour might be the door that gets them interested in what
we produce. Tell your friends to contribute so we can promote it to the world.
Sharing this campaign on your social media profile is just as valuable to us as
an actual financial pledge.</p>

<p>We are also having a contest called ""Find A Van &amp; Instagram"". How it works is you find a 15 passenger van in your travels and you take a picture of it and include details about the van in the description such as location, phone #, etc and if we end up purchasing a van that you found, we'll give you $100.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>He goes by many names......Dr. Funkenstein, Mr Wiggles the Worm, Lollipop Man. No matter what you call him his work is inescapable. George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic are pioneers of funk music, whose sound is the  DNA of modern Hip-Hop and Soul. From ""I Wanna Testify"", ""One Nation Under A Groove"", and ""Mothership Connection"" though ""Flashlight"", ""Atomic Dog"", and ""Paint The White House Black"", P-Funk has been on the front lines of progressive creativity and has forged a sound and a style that has turned heads and tore up stages for over 5 decades! But the flight of the Mothership has not been without turbulence. Countless acts of copyright fraud, theft, and intellectual injustice have and still continue to attempt to derail the funk from fulfilling its mission. As George fights daily for the funk, this campaign acts as an opportunity for us to unite and return it to its rightful owners.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As George continues to battle for the rights to his own songs we are looking to expand our self-sufficient nature, as to not need the powers that be: record labels, lawyers, and publishers. By expanding our own studio and creating a better environment for the housing of George's classic material past and present, we are creating an opportunity for this and future generations of funkateers to be able to continue to spread the message that ""Everything Is On The One!"" and we are ""One Nation Under A Groove"". As we put a stop to corrupt figures who continue to claim rights and ownership of the funk from the shadows, we are creating an environment that enables the funk to live on forever.</p>

The Impact
We're just trying to impact the

What We Need
We need $4,000 to get FLAME,

<p>more about Vito:</p>
<p> </p>
<div>Vito Petroccitto is magic. And we’re not just talking about the way he deftly casts alternating spells on his audiences, moving them either to awe, tears, full-out belly laughs, or all three at once. Armed only with his gritty, dirty, swampy telecaster guitar, his crazy-good vocal chords, and more than a touch of genius, Vito has somehow figured out how to do the work of ten men. If he’s not performing all over the Hudson Valley with “Four Guys in Disguise” (the band he co-founded in 1989, voted “Best of the Hudson Valley” for years running), he’s out gigging with his newest brainchild, “Left by the Wayside:” a swampy blues and funk band. Think Little Feat meets John Fogerty meets the Grateful Dead.</div>
<div>And if he’s not rocking around the valley with his own two bands, he’s opening for major acts like Eddie Money, The Doobie Brothers, Orleans, NRBQ, The Rascals, The Chris Barrons Band (lead vocalist for the Spin Doctors) and Deep Banana Blackout—to name a few.</div>
<div>Well, anyone can open for big acts. Sure. But how about getting right up in there with them? Vito has backed up the likes of Sloan Wainwright, Professor Louie and the Cromatix, The Willie Amrod Band and David Roth, both nationally and internationally.</div>
<div>Still not getting the picture? The list goes on. He’s performed with Merl Saunders, Tony Levin, Peter Levin, Jerry Marotta, Joe Brouchard, John Platania, Tommy Byrnes, Pete Seeger, Buddy Cage, John Hall and Larry Hoppen, Freebo, Severin Browne, Penny Nichols and Ritt Henn as well.</div>
<div>So what does Vito do with his remaining gobs of spare time? Just a few light and fluffy things: he teaches guitar, writes music for his band and for commercial enterprises (like Interpay, the fourth largest payroll company in the U.S., or, perhaps, the YANKEES), acts, produces, owns and operates Studio 1061, performs on PBS documentaries and radio shows across the nation, records album after album after album of his own, sits as a session musician, and—oh yeah—raises twins with his wife.</div>
<div>You’d think the man would be exhausted. Burnt out. Ready to prop his feet up on a chaise lounge on some breathtaking beach somewhere in the Caribbean. You know, rest on his laurels a little.</div>
<div>If you think that, then you don’t know Vito Petroccitto (with two “t’s” and two “c-to’s”).</div>
<div>Vito is a true artist, born of a true artist. He has lived, breathed and (hardly) slept music all his life. Moreover, he is a true entertainer. He is happiest with his telecaster strapped around his neck, but his versatility lends the depth and staying power necessary to make his art a lifelong career. He takes on anything and everything—within the bounds of personal integrity, of course—and what sets him apart is the way he dives in, whole-hog, always bringing his full-on passion, remarkable and wide-ranging technique and skill, boundless energy, and genuine soul-smile to each and every endeavor.</div>
<div>Vito Petroccitto is larger than life, both literally and figuratively. If you don’t leave an encounter with him smiling your head off, you may have no soul.</div>

С вашей помощью мы сможем записать пластинку, которая наверняка будет как минимум на голову выше первого альбома по всем параметрам: уровень материала, качество звука и так далее.

If everything goes well, we'll release an album in the middle of fall. You'll get your perks around the release date. 
Result
With your help we will be able to record an album which will be at least a cut above our first LP on all counts.
Our donators will get for example a limited version of an album which will be different (attn!) not only by it's design, but also by it's content, and, depending on the size of donations, different great gifts and gratitudes.
These of you who will get a tshirt or a hoodie, will be able to choose a special signature design and an exact size you need.
Other ways to help
If you can't help us with money or you want to provide your assistance in addition to your donation, you can share our music and this page with all your mates. We say thank you to every single one of you who responds to our call.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>I WANNA SING GOSPEL SONGS IN RUSSIA</strong></p>
<p>I have been invited by my friend, Mitya Kuznetsov, to perform in his summer festival in Rybinsk, Russia. Mitya is an acclaimed Russian folk musician and founding member of the folk group, Seventh Water from Russia. I want to take these Carter Family gospel and spiritual songs and more to Russia and teach the harmonies to the musicians and the people there. I want to open the door to the discussion of these regional country melodies and harmonies. I am looking to explore and chronicle how they stir the soul of Russians half a word away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>MUSIC IS AS CLOSE AS WE GET TO WHERE WE'VE COME FROM</strong></p>
<p>I grew up in a fundamental Christian church singing hymns with no accompaniment. I learned harmonies from singing and listening. My grandmother taught me to read shape notes and to sing these songs from the heart. She was a huge fan of the Carter Family. Particularly their gospel songs, ""Keep On The Sunny Side,"" ""Never Grow Old,"" ""Working on a Building"" and ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken."" The lyrics of these songs reach for an understanding of the spirit. But to me the melodies and the harmonies are just as important. Even without the lyrics, many of these songs tell a story. Stories of yearning and regret. Stories of searching deep inside ourselves for an understanding of our own spirits. As the Persian poet Rumi asks, ""Where did I come from and what am I supposed to be doing?""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Here's what I'd like to do. I will travel to Rybinsk, Russia in mid-July and stay for three weeks. During that time I will teach Russian folk and country musicians these songs and the harmonies that are traditional to these songs. I am looking to mix the old-time gospel and country flavor with the Russian flavor. My fellow explorer, Mitya Kuznetsov is an accomplished Russian musician and producer of folk music from Russia, China, Scotland and the music of Native America. I will bring home the results of our collaboration.</p>
<p>Your donation will help cover:</p>
<p>-Transportation costs to and from Rybinsk, Russia.  And travel within Russia</p>
<p>-Housing and boarding costs</p>
<p>-Production costs for the project, including studio fees and post-production costs</p>

<p><b>Why this music, and why Tempesta?</b></p>
<p>
</p>French baroque music sports two key ingredients: dance rhythms and the French language itself. When this music was new in the 1750's, all this was common knowledge: no need to tell musicians how fast to play, say, a minuet, or how to lilt a line to mimic the short and long syllables in spoken word. Everybody knew that!  A modern-day ensemble has to recreate this musical language and learn how to speak with a similar accent. But once you get it, this music is pure fun. After we performed the Marias and Rebel from Volume 1, the Philadelphia Inquirer noted: <i>""Tempesta played with such energy and color that the witt, emotion and drolleries that define French art were brought to pulsing life""</i>. </div>
<div>Volume 2 will once again feature our full orchestra— winds, percussion, strings, continuo, and three trumpets — 28 musicians in all! Led by directors Gwyn Roberts (flute/recorder) and Richard Stone (theorbo/guitar) with concertmaster Emlyn Ngai, Tempesta performs all orchestral music without a conductor, as was the practice when this music was new. While you might not be able to ""see"" this on a recording, you will certainly ""hear"" the galloping horses, churning waves and dancing upholsterers.<p>

<p>Your tax-deductible contribution will help raise the remaining funds needed to make <i>Comédie &amp; Tragédie, Vol II</i> happen. Our goal for this campaign is to defray some of the immediate costs of the recording sessions, such as renting our recording space, Gould Hall at the Curtis Institute of Music, and engaging long-time Tempesta engineer Loren Stata.</p>

""Godzilla vs. Poutine"" - music and comic project 
Dear friends,
Robbob is releasing a new album with the participation of the Limoilou Libre Orchestra and several illustrious guest musicians. This digital album will be available as a colour booklet (with download code) in which ten talented artists from across Canada provide illustrations of Robbob's cartoon-y universe.
Here's an opportunity to help us complete this monstrous project; your contributions will help pay for recording, printing and distribution costs.
We are offering many perks in this campaign - the feature album, but also our CD, T-shirt, live performances and bottles of Damn! hot sauce. You can also help by sharing this campaign on your social networks.
Thanks for your support! 
Here's a taste of this big bad poutine:  https://robbob.bandcamp.com/album/godzilla-vs-p...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Earlier this year, I made the decision to realize my life-long dream of recording original music. I teamed up with a friend to produce and develop my debut EP ""The Secret Room."" Up to this point, the process has been very rewarding and very personal, but the project is no longer something I can pursue on my own. I need help covering the costs of recording the remaining tracks for the EP - that's right, remaining tracks! The first single has already been completed and released, and if you haven't heard it yet, I'm delighted to share it with you below.</p>

I along with my Dutch partner Linda, have created a registered non profit foundation called Music 4 Vets Netherland.  http://www.music4vets.nl/ After conversing with Dutch Veterans and performing investigating research we found in the Netherlands a need for a different approach in helping veterans re-adjust back into society after their tours of duty in hostilities around the globe.  Veterans are not only damaged physically, but also mentally from their experiences in hostile environments. Music 4 Vets Nederland is a Veteran initiative, with the concept of using music to help heal the scars of war, and to help the veterans release built up emotions, by using music as a therapeutic device.  Music 4 Vets Nederland needs your help, I can't do this alone, but together we can achieve great improvements in how we deal and approach Veterans who are lost in society.  Our Government and society has placed a stigma on veterans returning from hostile environments, Veterans returning from tours of duty in these environments feel a sense of helplessness, show little or no emotion, they withdraw from society along with their families and friends, they distance themselves from the ones they love and turn to other forms of release (such as illegal drugs and alcohol)  escaping the realities of our society in which they need to learn to adapt back into.  By supporting  our successful and proven foundation, you can help a veteran who fought for the freedoms and liberties you live by, to lead a healthy, normal and productive life, by using music to help them move forward into society.     Feel the healing power of music!Music 4 Vets Nederland is in dire need of a reliable Multi Van so that we can transport our musical instruments and equipment, to the different Veteran events which we participate in throughout the year.  Some of these events include Miles 4 Justice, Veterans day in the Hague, www.veteraneninstituut.nl  Veterans facilities throughout the Netherlands, and special events like the 70th anniversary of liberation day in Beek, We also play at benefit concerts for Wounded Warriors wounded warriors and Music 4 Vets Nederland fund raising events. The money that we generate  goes directly to Veterans initiatives as well as the foundation. Music 4 Vets Nederland, created the theme song Soldier, by Gavin Degraw, performed by Dutch Veteran, Niek Van Elderen for the Dutch Wounded Warriors Organization. Niek perfomed on the Dutch TV show, the Voice of Holland.I also wrote the closing song  for  The High Price of Freedom a movie documentary, about the sacrifice of one soldier Harold B. McCarn during WWII.  Music 4 Vets Nederland is in need of a good quality sound system with mixing board. We need amplifiers, electric guitars, acoustic guitars, drums, keyboards,  brass instruments, percussion instruments, microphones, stands, backing lighting, amplifiers.  Anything which is related to and associated with making music is important to us.  We need intruments to provide for the veteran who is in need, and can use the instrument as a devise to release built up energy to help ease the stress and tension a Veteran carries on their shoulders each and everyday.

<h3>Our Story 
</h3>
<p class=""bodytext"">""U BETTER Sing!"" is a unique educational web series that is the first of its kind to teach music literacy, basic music theory, music history/ethnomusicology, career options in the arts, music and its relationship to science, math, history, language arts, and social skills, and world cultures to its target audience of children ages 8 to 14 to create a unique and inspired life!  </p>
<p class=""bodytext""> </p>
<p class=""bodytext"">I came up with the idea for this show when I was teaching middle school choir in Round Rock, TX.  I pitched the idea of the show to Austin's local PBS affiliate, KLRU 3 years ago.  They loved the idea and told me to create the pilot.  After seeing the pilot episode of U BETTER Sing!, they agreed it would make an excellent web series and even a possible TV series, but now, it is up to me and my board to come up with funding for the show's production in order to get past the pilot episode.</p>
<p class=""bodytext""> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Right now, the world is at a turning point.  The world's economy, the traditional educational systems are STRUGGLING because we are still basing our values on the mentality of the industrial revolution.  We are taught to believe that to be TRULY successful and respected, one must get a college degree in a respectable, core subject so that you can get a STABLE job to work for someone else... work and work until you're 65 to earn retirement, and THEN have fun by doing what you WANT to do....IF you're not to worn out to enjoy your sunset years.  Youth today are seeing giant corporations fall, and seeing their who gave up on their dreams  to WORK in the ""REAL WORLD""  to make ends meet. HANDS ON LEARNING through EXPERIENCING the world through our SENSES makes learning STICK!  Do you remember School House Rock?! I remember so much of English grammar and math, and HISTORY through the songs we learned.  It expanded my mind, my vocabulary, and instilled the importance of joy while learning and growing!   We NEED show's like U BETTER Sing! to encourage young people to create a unique and INSPIRED life that stimulates their minds, their hearts, and eventually, and naturally, as a RESULT of following their PASSIONS and getting an solid education in areas where they excel, their bank accounts will FLOURISH as either an employer or as an employee! <br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The STAR of U BETTER Sing! music literacy show is the show's cartoon, "" U BETTER Sight Sing!"" This first of its kind cartoon teaches a few things: </p>
<p>1.How to audiate (how to hear music in your mind...like hearing words in your mind as you silently read words on a page of a book) in order to ""SIGHT SING"" music (the ability to pick up a piece of music, look at it, and hear the music in your mind, and then, SING it aloud...like reading the words off page of a book aloud!)</p>
<p>2. Teaches its audience how to deal with issues like bullying, how to cooperate, collaborate, and create with people who are ""different"" from you---people who may be out of your ""comfort zone!"" i.e. A different race, differently abled, different socioeconomic group, different culture, etc. The other segments of the show will be funded in other ways.  Here is the breakdown of production costs for the cartoon: U BETTER Sight-Sing! which you can see in this site:</p>

</div></div>","Our Story 

""U BETTER Sing!"" is a unique educational web series that is the first of its kind to teach music literacy, basic music theory, music history/ethnomusicology, career options in the arts, music and its relationship to science, math, history, language arts, and social skills, and world cultures to its target audience of children ages 8 to 14 to create a unique and inspired life!  
 
I came up with the idea for this show when I was teaching middle school choir in Round Rock, TX.  I pitched the idea of the show to Austin's local PBS affiliate, KLRU 3 years ago.  They loved the idea and told me to create the pilot.  After seeing the pilot episode of U BETTER Sing!, they agreed it would make an excellent web series and even a possible TV series, but now, it is up to me and my board to come up with funding for the show's production in order to get past the pilot episode.
 
 


The Impact
Right now, the world is at a turning point.  The world's economy, the traditional educational systems are STRUGGLING because we are still basing our values on the mentality of the industrial revolution.  We are taught to believe that to be TRULY successful and respected, one must get a college degree in a respectable, core subject so that you can get a STABLE job to work for someone else... work and work until you're 65 to earn retirement, and THEN have fun by doing what you WANT to do....IF you're not to worn out to enjoy your sunset years.  Youth today are seeing giant corporations fall, and seeing their who gave up on their dreams  to WORK in the ""REAL WORLD""  to make ends meet. HANDS ON LEARNING through EXPERIENCING the world through our SENSES makes learning STICK!  Do you remember School House Rock?! I remember so much of English grammar and math, and HISTORY through the songs we learned.  It expanded my mind, my vocabulary, and instilled the importance of joy while learning and growing!   We NEED show's like U BETTER Sing! to encourage young people to create a unique and INSPIRED life that stimulates their minds, their hearts, and eventually, and naturally, as a RESULT of following their PASSIONS and getting an solid education in areas where they excel, their bank accounts will FLOURISH as either an employer or as an employee! 


What We Need & What You Get
 
The STAR of U BETTER Sing! music literacy show is the show's cartoon, "" U BETTER Sight Sing!"" This first of its kind cartoon teaches a few things: 
1.How to audiate (how to hear music in your mind...like hearing words in your mind as you silently read words on a page of a book) in order to ""SIGHT SING"" music (the ability to pick up a piece of music, look at it, and hear the music in your mind, and then, SING it aloud...like reading the words off page of a book aloud!)
2. Teaches its audience how to deal with issues like bullying, how to cooperate, collaborate, and create with people who are ""different"" from you---people who may be out of your ""comfort zone!"" i.e. A different race, differently abled, different socioeconomic group, different culture, etc. The other segments of the show will be funded in other ways.  Here is the breakdown of production costs for the cartoon: U BETTER Sight-Sing! which you can see in this site:
Sound Engineer: 
$250.00 for one half day session 
1. Session One: Recording of voice over actors
2.  Session Two: Recording of instrumental accompaniment, sound effects, vocalists
3.  Session Three:  Editing of actors and music, sound effects

<h3>What is this all about?</h3>
<p>Original and unique music, producing my first album  .</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> I’ve been composing and recording my own music for many years, while doing an abundance of other creative projects in TV, Film and stage. I've realized that it's time to go back to my origins and put all my emphasis on music again. (I'm a graduate of Rimon school of jazz and contemporary music in Israel, and after graduation I spent some time in Boston, working with Berkley graduates.)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>  I have 15 musical pieces waiting to be professionally produced and heard by others and not only by my great and loving friends and family. It's time for this music to come out of the drawer.   Luckily I was recently introduced to Shai Lowenstein, a multi talented music producer, involved these days in some of the most interesting musical projects around, here in  Israel.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Some of his work is available here:</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>We immediately bonded and made this first piece ( <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/dalit-ziv/sati-demo2-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/dalit-ziv/sati-demo2-2</a> ), to test how we <a href=""#"" id=""_GPLITA_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: green; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px double;"">feel</a> about working with each other for the first time. Well, it felt great. Both of us got extremely excited about the possibility of producing my first album together. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>However, we need your help to make this.   I’m sure that it is going to be a great, one of a kind album! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>A few more details to share:</h3>
<p>I call it “Suggestions to the Unconscious.""   I was digging into my unconscious in the last two years, to find some answers about my life. Much imagery came out of this fascinating journey, which has become parts of these musical pieces.   But beyond all these stories and words, I’m talking about some great innovative music -- unique, emotional and very sincere -- creating its own genre. A music that needs to be shared and heard. A music of its own right, deserving the exposure, finally seeing the light of day. <br/><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Recording an album is expensive!</h3>
<p>We need the funds for renting a recording studio and pay for musicians to come  and record the music with us.

<p><br/></p>
</div><div>

<p>Musicians, filmmakers, painters, and all sorts of artists put so much effort, talent, love, time and money for things that don’t give money back.

<h3>Short Summary  </h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">With the new record ready to release, Alabaster gets ready for the adventure of a life time.  They are packing their bags and making their dream become a reality.  </span></h3>
<p>fAlabaster is a band of six that is no stranger to hard work and perserverance! A ""do-it-yourself"" band, they have been creating their own music, art, websites, marketing, promotion, hype, and sometimes even clothing and instruments, for many years.  Their passion is music. The energy they put into creating and giving themselves to their fans, and the response they get in return, is what keeps them going.  </p>
<p>Alabaster has toured before but has had to rely on someone else for transportation.  They are reaching out to you now to help them buy a van of their own so that they can deliver their music across the country whenever they want!  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Although a tour bus would be nice, it's much too large and expensive. Alabaster is very familiar with life on the road and has travled and slept under some very interesting circumstances.  Alabaster is now interested in a 12 - 15 passanger van.  This would allow enough room for sleeping, luggage, and gear and would eliminate the need for a trailer.  A van this size can cost anywhere between $8,000 - $10,000 depending on miles and condition.  </p>
<p>Howvever, the cost of renting one of an entire tour is very expensive:</p>
<p>Van: $700/wk<br/>Gas: $200/day + $0.30/mi<br/>Insurance: $200/wk<br/>Hotel: $70/night<br/><br/>Clearly renting is not the cheapest way to go.  However, with your help Alabaster would be able to own their own van and buy their own insurance, eliminating extra expenses!  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is almost nothing Alabaster loves more than being out on the road; exposing their music to all that will listen.  They love meeting new people, seeing new places, and playing with new bands all over the country.  Because they don't own their own van, they cannot simply plan a tour whenever they want, but must consider a lot of expences.  There are, of course, expences that will still exist, but you can truly help them eliminate a lot of them and provide them with the security of their own property.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone has the money to contribute.  Anything helps, but if you truly cannot contribute, then please help Alabaster by spreading the word.  Post this on all your social media sites and tell all your friends!! Thank you so much!!</p>

<p>Of course, this will not be easy.  My plan is to travel the western US, earning my keep (and hopefully enough money to pay for the recording of the next Kentucky Nightmare album) by performing on the street.  I also hope to make new connections, meet new people, have new experiences to write songs about, and hone my craft.  To accomplish this goal, I'm going to need some help.</p>
<p>I'm asking for $700 in donations.  This money will pay for transportation costs (not just inter-city or inter-state travel, but even intra-city buses and taxis), clothing, guitar strings, food, shelter, and keeping my cell phone turned on, so that I can communicate with hosts, navigate new cities, and keep you all informed of the ups and downs of my adventure.<br/></p>
<p>Along this path, I hope to move as many people in as many places as possible with sweet, sweet music.  Not only that, but I plan to write a bunch of new songs along my adventure, and write a book about all the places I've seen, people I've met, and experiences I've had along my journey.  I hope to inspire more people to follow their bliss--to escape the rat race and explore their full potential.  After all, I'm not the only passionate, capable artist out there.  Not by a long shot!</p>
<p>This journey will not be easy.  There will be many nights spent in dangerous locations.  There will be countless unknowns, including how much money I will make at any given time and place, or if I will make any money at all.  I will have to perform for a lot of drunk and volatile people, because that's where the money is when it's there for the gettin'.  I will have to explore unfamiliar territory with an open mind and heart, but also a watchful eye for danger.  I have already given up all of my material possessions except what will fit in a backpack and a guitar case.  And I have no illusions about how treacherous a world this is.  This is a danger that I accept and embrace.  The imperative of bringing my music to the world can no longer be ignored at the cost of my financial and emotional stability.  If I can paint an entire two-story, 4,000 sq. ft. house exterior by myself, I can handle these dangers.  Those of you who know me know that I am fearless and determined.</p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute personally, perhaps you know someone else who is passionate about art or music and who has some disposable income who might be.  You might not even know that you know such a person.  So please, even if you can't contribute, tell your other friends about what your amazing friend Simon P. Moore decided to do with his energy.  Heck, you might even inspire someone else to find their true calling as well!<br/></p>

Along this path, I hope to move as many people in as many places as possible with sweet, sweet music.  Not only that, but I plan to write a bunch of new songs along my adventure, and write a book about all the places I've seen, people I've met, and experiences I've had along my journey.  I hope to inspire more people to follow their bliss--to escape the rat race and explore their full potential.  After all, I'm not the only passionate, capable artist out there.  Not by a long shot!
This journey will not be easy.  There will be many nights spent in dangerous locations.  There will be countless unknowns, including how much money I will make at any given time and place, or if I will make any money at all.  I will have to perform for a lot of drunk and volatile people, because that's where the money is when it's there for the gettin'.  I will have to explore unfamiliar territory with an open mind and heart, but also a watchful eye for danger.  I have already given up all of my material possessions except what will fit in a backpack and a guitar case.  And I have no illusions about how treacherous a world this is.  This is a danger that I accept and embrace.  The imperative of bringing my music to the world can no longer be ignored at the cost of my financial and emotional stability.  If I can paint an entire two-story, 4,000 sq. ft. house exterior by myself, I can handle these dangers.  Those of you who know me know that I am fearless and determined.
Even if you can't contribute personally, perhaps you know someone else who is passionate about art or music and who has some disposable income who might be.  You might not even know that you know such a person.  So please, even if you can't contribute, tell your other friends about what your amazing friend Simon P. Moore decided to do with his energy.  Heck, you might even inspire someone else to find their true calling as well!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><u><strong>Who we are?</strong></u></p>
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>we are Malte and Alex - together <strong>Yatao</strong> - and a handpan/world music duo hailing from Berlin. We met about 5 years ago and ever since we keep (re-)discovering our common love for music. We have gone a long path and experienced a lot together - on a musical level and also on our friendships's level.</p>
<p>Our music found its beginning on the streets. Inspired by the people and their reactions to our music, to the sounds of the handpan, our playing style stayed true to the spontaneity and honesty of the moment.</p>
<p>In the meantime we only seldom play on the streets but still kept the spirit. During the past 5 years we gave hundreds of concerts for free - in the strong belief that giving and receiving will always be balanced.</p>
<p><br/><strong><u>What will we do?</u></strong></p>
<p>Together with you we now want to make another step forward. We already created a couple of albums, self-made from beginning to the end - always on no or low budget. </p>
<p>Also for our <strong>new album 'Drops to Oceans'</strong> we want to accompany every step of the process, but inviting professional friends to help and be able to reach a quality that we couldn't reach without them. To finally create a piece of art that is beyond what we created as yet.</p>
<p>Our music is only precious when it reaches open ears and hearts. Help us to create an album that touches people in their core and ignites a spark of peace in our souls.</p>
<p>Our new album 'Drops to Oceans' will be published on the 31st August, 2019. If you help us grow this seed, you will receive the album even before the official release.</p>
<p>Starting at the end of September until the end of the year 2019 we will hit the road again and tour all over Central Europe, playing concerts with free entrance, presenting you our new album and spreading the love.</p>
<p>Thanks for being part! &lt;3</p>
<p><br/><strong><u>How will we do this?</u></strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of June, we will go to a nice little hut in the middle of nowhere, somewhere between Berlin and Hamburg, with all our instruments and recording gear, nice food and the best vibes we can bring. We will spend full 5 days to record, experiment, talk, change and settle with the best musical pieces that we can create.</p>
<p>The Album Cover is already in work and will be done by the amazing Munich based artist Vicky Anna Lardschneider (<a href=""https://instagram.com/v.annart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/v.annart/)</a>. She will also do the T-Shirt design.</p>
<p>We will ask our dear friends from Camissa Audio (<a href=""http://www.camissa-audio.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.camissa-audio.de/</a>) to master our tracks so they sound amazing on all devices that you can think of and make your ears sizzle.</p>
<p><br/><strong><u>What do we need the money for?</u></strong></p>
<p>We got the instruments and the creative minds - so that's all set. But we DO need money for making the artwork (1500€) and for mastering (1000€), then we need to press the CDs so our music can materialise (3500€). We need to spend some money in advertising this campaign and the release of the album so people can know about it (maybe 500€). We need some money to ship all the perks to you that you want to hold in your hands (800€) and last but not least, indiegogo and the handling of the payments eat up another 8 to 10% of the whole cake.</p>
<p>All in all we will need about 7500€ to let this project happen. The more the better because you will help to cover our costs. But to be honest - we will make this happen anyway, cause this is what we do! :)</p>
<p>In deep gratitude and relatedness,</p>

<p>Hallo ihr Lieben,</p>
<p>wir sind Alex und Malte, zusammen <strong>Yatao</strong>, ein Handpan/Weltmusik Duo aus Berlin. Wir trafen uns vor 5 Jahren und seitdem entdecken und erforschen wir gemeinsam unsere Liebe zur Musik. Viele Höhen und Tiefen haben wir seitdem erlebt, sowohl auf freundschaftlicher Ebene, als auch auf musikalischer.</p>
<p>Den Ursprung fand unsere Musik auf der Straße. Inspiriert von den Menschen und ihren Reaktionen auf unsere Musik, den Klängen der Handpan, hat sich unser Spielstil nie entfernt von der Spontanität und Ehrlichkeit des Moments.</p>
<p>Mittlerweile spielen wir nur noch wenig auf der Straße. Den Spirit haben wir aber mitgenommen. So gaben wir in den vergangenen 5 Jahren nahezu alle von uns organisierten Konzerte auf Spendenbasis - stets im Vertrauen, dass sich Schenken und Empfangen die Waage halten.</p>
<p><br/><strong><u>Was wollen wir machen?</u></strong></p>
<p>Heute sind wir hier und wollen zusammen mit euch einen nächsten Schritt wagen! Einige Alben sind schon entstanden, alle in Eigenregie von vorne bis hinten - immer ohne Budget. Auch bei unserem neuen Album 'Drops to Oceans' wollen wir jeden Schritt begleiten, uns jedoch von Menschen an die Hand nehmen lassen, die Qualitäten mitbringen, die wir nicht haben. Um am Ende auch eine Qualität zu erreichen, die jenseits dessen ist was wir bisher kreierten.</p>
<p>Unsere Musik wird erst wertvoll, wenn sie Ohren und Seelen erreicht. Helft uns ein Album zu produzieren, das uns Menschen im Inneren berührt und so ein wenig mehr Frieden in unseren Herzen stiftet.</p>
<p>Unser neues Album 'Drops to Oceans' wird am 31.08.2019 offiziell released. Wenn ihr uns helft, dieses Projekt zu realisieren bekommt ihr es sogar noch davor!</p>
<p>Ab Ende September bis zum Ende des Jahres spielen wir dann eine auf Spenden basierte „Album Release Tour“ in Zentraleuropa, um euch das Album live zu präsentieren und Gutes zu verbreiten.</p>
<p>Danke, dass du Teil davon bist! &lt;3</p>
<p><br/><strong><u>Wie machen wir das?</u></strong></p>
<p>Anfang Juni werden wir gemeinsam in eine kleine Hütte zwischen Hamburg und Berlin gehen, irgendwo im Nirgendwo, all unsere Instrumente im Gepäck, Aufnahmeequipment, gutes Essen und die besten Vibes, die wir zu bieten haben. Wir werden 5 Tage dort verbringen, um aufzunehmen, zu experimentieren, reden, abändern und festlegen auf die besten musikalischen Stücke, die unsere Muße uns kreieren lässt.</p>
<p>Das Albumcover ist bereits in Arbeit und wird gezaubert von der wundervollen Münchner Künstlerin Vicky Anna Lardschneider (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/v.annart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/v.annart/</a>). Sie wird auch das Design der T-Shirts und unser gesamtes Tourdesign erstellen.</p>
<p>Wir werden unsere guten Freunde von Camissa Audio (<a href=""http://www.camissa-audio.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.camissa-audio.de/</a>) bitten uns durch ihr Mastering den bestmöglichen Sound unserer Tracks zu liefern, sodass Eure Ohren kribbeln werden.</p>
<p><br/><u><strong>Wofür brauchen wir das ganze Geld?</strong></u></p>
<p>Wir haben die Instrumente und die kreativen Köpfe - dafür ist also schon gesorgt. Aber wir brauchen Geld, um das gesamte Artwork zu kreieren (1500€), für's Mastering (1000€), um die CDs zu pressen, sodass unsere Musik sich materialisieren kann (2500€). Außerdem müssen wir die Crowdfundingkampagne sowie den Release unseres Albums promoten, sodass ihr auch etwas davon erfahrt (etwa 500€). Um euch eure CDs zu schicken, brauchen wir etwa 800€ und zu guter Letzt gehen etwa 8 bis 10% der gesamten Einnahmen an Indiegogo und die Zahlungsdienste.</p>
<p>Alles in Allem brauchen wir um die 7500€, um dieses Projekt realisieren zu können. Je mehr desto besser, weil jeder Euro unsere weiteren Kosten mindert. Aber um ehrlich zu sein werden wir dieses Album so oder so in die Welt setzen. Weil dies nun mal das ist, was wir tun und lieben! :)</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Aasha Francis and I'm artistically known as Aasha Marie. Since my early childhood I've always been fond of the music and the arts. I personally believe God gave me the affinity for music and gifted me to express myself through song, poetry and the arts. I'm a native of Chicago, Illinois and am proud to be from this city I call my home. I've spent most of 2019 recording, performing and building up my confidence as an artist and as an individual.  However I started my musical journey in 2014 with my first EP entitled ""Breaking Obscurity"" and I've learned so much along the way. As I'm embarking on my journey toward my first full length rap album I am launching this campaign to raise funds for it's completion. This album entitled WYWS (While You Were Sleeping represents a physical and spiritual awakening for me to steward my gift well and use it to be a blessing to others. WYWS features poetry, rap and original songs all penned by me reflecting the current times and my faith. This campaign is important to me because it is a FIRST. A FIRST for me to complete, release and market an album but also for the FIRST time ever not being ashamed or afraid to walk in my gift and share it with others. I made WYWS for people who are sleeping on their own God given talent and abilities not knowing it's what God wants to use to free them out of that prison/mindset to help others. In recording this album, it was a message for me personally to wake from my sleep and shine a light in the darkness and I hope I can encourage others to do this same. With your financial contribution to this project my FIRST album can be released and reach more people who like me are fighting to finish their FIRST, whatever that FIRST maybe in life. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Aasha Francis and I'm artistically known as Aasha Marie. Since my early childhood I've always been fond of the music and the arts. I personally believe God gave me the affinity for music and gifted me to express myself through song, poetry and the arts. I'm a native of Chicago, Illinois and am proud to be from this city I call my home. I've spent most of 2019 recording, performing and building up my confidence as an artist and as an individual.  However I started my musical journey in 2014 with my first EP entitled ""Breaking Obscurity"" and I've learned so much along the way. As I'm embarking on my journey toward my first full length rap album I am launching this campaign to raise funds for it's completion. This album entitled WYWS (While You Were Sleeping represents a physical and spiritual awakening for me to steward my gift well and use it to be a blessing to others. WYWS features poetry, rap and original songs all penned by me reflecting the current times and my faith. This campaign is important to me because it is a FIRST. A FIRST for me to complete, release and market an album but also for the FIRST time ever not being ashamed or afraid to walk in my gift and share it with others. I made WYWS for people who are sleeping on their own God given talent and abilities not knowing it's what God wants to use to free them out of that prison/mindset to help others. In recording this album, it was a message for me personally to wake from my sleep and shine a light in the darkness and I hope I can encourage others to do this same. With your financial contribution to this project my FIRST album can be released and reach more people who like me are fighting to finish their FIRST, whatever that FIRST maybe in life. 

What We Need & What You Get
I am raising $4,500 and funding will go toward the following:

Photography, Videography, Editing (mini-docs, music videos, cover art, performances etc.)
Hiring musicians, singers, graphic/web designers 
Lighting, Props, Wardrobe/Costume, and other filming needs 
Marketing, PR, Promotion/Advertising of the album 
Music Production and CD production/duplication 

For your contribution you will receive:

Free T-shirt (for contributions of $50)
Free T-shirt and Advanced copy of WYWS album (for contributions of $75)
Free entry to WYWS listening party, copy of WYWS and free merch (for contributions of $100)
All of the above + exclusive BTS footage (for contributions of $150 or more)


The Impact
Why your contribution is needed:

Lack of funds can be a huge roadblock for many indie artists like myself and it's one of the reasons why so many great ideas, so much inspiration and talents are missing from the world
With the proper funding I can get my album in places I otherwise couldn't and build my brand and go on my first tour
I am creating clean, creative, content for the culture and I want future generations to know that they can be contrary to the culture while making a positive contribution to my city

<h3>Help The School get to SXSW!</h3>
<p>THE SCHOOL have been officially invited by SXSW to play in Austin, Texas during March 2020. We need help raising money to cover the costs of getting us there. </p>
<p>This is a HUGE opportunity for the band, SXSW is the most important showcase in the world, attended by music industry from many different countries. It will allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>raise the profile of the band</li>
<li>introduce our 4th album in the USA, due for release later in 2020 on Elefant Records</li>
<li>find a team in the US to help work on the album with us, along with other countries </li>
<li>make connections so we can come back for a full US tour once the album is out</li>
<li>make connections in other countries too so we're more likely to tour near you</li>
<li>export some awesome Welsh music to the world!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We're Looking for</h3>
<p>We'd love to be able to take the whole band so we can be at our very best, but flights, accomm, visas are very expensive. </p>
<p>We're looking for anything we can get close towards the cost of the trip. We realise Christmas is the worst time to ask for help and everyone is skint, but we'll be grateful for anything we can get.</p>
<p>Our costs per person include £380-440 flights, hold luggage for instruments, accommodation in a Motel 6 for 6 nights, visas are £120. Then there's extras like getting to the airport and parking, getting around Austin each day, insurance, getting to the interview at the US Embassy for our visas - this all adds up with 8 band members. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>You'll be helping us export Welsh indie pop to the world! Plus raising our chances of going back later for a full US tour once our new album is out and we have a great team in place. </p>
<p>We believe there's demand for our music in the USA, you can see that just with the records we've sold there so far (solely through distribution, we haven't had a label or press team there before), our digital sales and streams are very high, and we've been lucky to get some US synchs including a few Netflix shows. We want to build on this! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we don't raise all the money we'll still go, but probably just with 3-4 band members so we feel it wouldn't be The School at our best. We're determined to make the most of this trip. </p>
<p><i><strong>If we don't reach our final target we still receive the money donated so far</strong></i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You could share our campaign and listen to our music, every tiny bit can still help us. If you see that we're playing a show near you soon (eg 21st Dec in London) then buying a ticket would also really help us. thank you so much! x</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>We are Ona and Helly, collectively known as Joann Fabrix. Our duo is a pop project that we started just over a year ago, but we have been making music together for over four years! We spent this summer and fall making an album - FABLE, which recently got picked up by Funnybone records.  The songs on FABLE are nursery rhymes and fairytales taking shape as sample-based experimental pop. Our album is set to be released in April, but we need your help putting together a music video for our debut single!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Story &amp; Style</h3>
<p>In line with the stories in fables and fairytales, the loose narrative will focus on us in a fabricated forest, where we are turned into foxes after drinking a liquid from an enchanted tree. In the video there will be three sets: a forest set, a glowing storybook made by projecting images through paper and an outdoor kite flying scene. </p>
<p>Our set and costumes will draw on works like Kenneth Anger's ""A Rabbit Moon"", Kate Bush's music videos as well as The Tales of Beatrix Potter put on by the Royal Ballet. We will create a mood that balances humor, spook and enchantment:</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>In order to make this video happen we need your help! Below is an outline of how your money will be spent:</p>
<p><b>Equipment Rental ($300) - </b>We will need to rent an awesome camera, lenses, a UV filter as well as lights to fill our our set and help create the right mood. </p>
<p><strong>Production Design ($200) -</strong> Bringing our enchanted world to life will only be possible with a visually rich set, costumes and props. </p>
<p><strong>Directing and Editing Rate ($250) - </strong>A highly important expense to make sure our director and editor, Regina Melady, is compensated for the hours put into working on this project.</p>
</div><div>

<h3>The Team </h3>
<p><strong>Regina Melady, Director -</strong> Regina is a Brooklyn-based filmmaker whose work includes music videos for pop and experimental musicians such as Robot Ginger and Jack Whitescarver. She seeks to blend classical filmmaking techniques with homemade visual effects, eye-popping colors, and a DIY sensibility. During an artist residency in 2018, Regina created commercials for a tea farm in rural Nanjian, China, blending footage of traditional farming and drying methods with green screen special effects and visuals. She is thrilled to collaborate with the minds behind Joann Fabrix and to bring this fable to screen. To view her reel click the link below: </p>

Toby is so psyched to work on this project with dear buds!</p>
<p><strong>Lu Donovan, Choreographer -  </strong>Luisa is a choreographer, performer, and educator based in Philadelphia.

<p><strong>LISTEN TO THE MUSIC AT: <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/john-tokarczyk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"">https://soundcloud.com/john-tokarczyk</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>JOHN TOKARCZYK AND CLARITY</strong></p>
<p>Throughout my life I have always considered myself to be an easy going low key person.  I always try to look at the positive side of all situations and understand that everything that happens to you, good or bad, is a great learning experience.  I think laughter is the best medicine and the more positive people you have in your life, the more uplifting and wonderful your life will be.</p>
<p>I have been listening to and playing music for the majority of my life.  It all started when I was in 5<sup>th</sup> grade and played the trumpet at school to stay out of reading period……It was all over after that.  I took classes in guitar, piano, and drums.  I also picked up bass and vocal work along the way.  Once I had an understanding of the music world, I started to write and compose music.  Over my 20+ years of experience, I have written and produced rock, hard rock, folk, and instrumental music.</p>
<p>Nine years ago, I also got involved with energy work and natural/self healing.  Due to certain life experiences, I decided to take a class in meditation and energy work.  While studying, I concluded that I must learn Reiki, a Japanese energy healing technique that uses healing chi energy to balance your chakras and clear your aura of imbalances.  While studying to become a Reiki master my instructor, Nanci Cannon, said I should write a meditation CD.  I loved the idea, but it was obviously not the right time then.</p>
<p>This 2 years in the making, 9 song album is titled “Clarity”.  This a meditation / new age album.  Each song is specifically written to sooth and relax you while incorporating sound healing and sound therapy. Sound therapy uses certain frequencies to resonate with your body to help reduce stress, bring your mind to a calm and centered place, help with disease and disorders, clear your chakras and remove toxins from your body.   This music is specifically designed to vibrate with your chakras and is tuned to resonate with your body.  A few techniques used are tuning to 432 Hz, setting the song tempo to match the human heart beat while at rest, and incorporating solfeggio tones.  While listening you will enjoy the music and get the benefits of the embedded sound healing frequencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE CAMPAIGN AND IT’S IMPORTANCE TO ME</strong></p>
<p>“Clarity”  is very important to me for many reasons.  For me, this project is the first of it’s kind.  I have finally incorporated both parts of my life and my low key positive minded personality to capture this special moment in time.  It is the perfect cliché, “This music incorporates my mindset, heart, and soul”.  I have always been someone that loves to help people.  I don’t even think twice when someone comes to me for help.  And that is really what this project is about, helping people.  Helping people to reduce stress and give the body tools to self heal and balance.  Helping people to live a happier and healthier life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT I NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>I have been able to write, compose, produce, record, and mix the album.  This journey cannot be completed without your help.  If you decide to contribute, your money will go towards: </p>
<ul>
<li>$200: Updating computer software to complete the artwork.</li>
<li>$240: Music mastering to bring the audio to commercial audio standards.</li>
<li>$260: Manufacturing of the first 100 actual CD’s.</li>
<li>$100: Copyright and basic online digital distribution.</li>
<li>The additional money covers Indiegogo’s percentage and fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do decide to help, there are many perks available to you including a copy of the album, 10 questions sent to me that I will answer (any subject…let you mind go crazy!), your name included in the CD liner notes, and personal thank you notes emailed/posted/facebooked directly to you.  You can also spend time with John in: reiki healing sessions, drum lessons, a casual lunch, and recording time in his home studio (you must be able to get to Mebane, NC or live in the area).  If you are feeling especially giving, you can even become an Executive Producer (There are no publishing or licensing rights, or royalties included with this title.)!!!!</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal, the money raised will still go towards what it can while I find other means raise the rest to release this album.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PROJECT’S IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>This campaign will provide me with the stepping stone to get this project off the ground and the music to the people that can benefit from it.  The main steps I am trying to accomplish are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the physical CD inventory.</li>
<li>Setup digital distribution.</li>
<li>Accomplish physical distribution within regional stores. </li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that healing music and positive thinking can change the world in which we live.  Have you ever heard the phrase, “Teach 5<sup>th</sup> graders how to meditate and you will end violence in one generation”?  That is what this project is about.  Solving the world's intensity, negativity, and imbalance with simple and non violent ways. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</strong></p>
<p>I understand if you are not in the financial situation to help at this time.  But you can still help by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forwarding this page to all your friends to help spread the word.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tool located right below the video.</li>
<li>Post a link to this page on your social media walls/sites.</li>
<li>Tell a friend or loved one at your next social event about how we can make the world a better place.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope through this project, I will be able to both entertain people and help them live a healthy and happier life.</p>

<h3>Who is The New Up?</h3>
<p>The New Up is a truly independent, DIY, electro rock band from San Francisco that's always done things our own way. Over the last several years, we have spent countless hours writing, rehearsing, recording and touring. Through this journey and some serious self-reflection, we've come to a vision of the music we really want to make, the music we strongly feel could have a significant impact on the community and the world. In a city and nation with increasingly limited resources for the arts and where artists struggle to survive, we have never stopped working toward our dream. <strong>Your contribution to our campaign will allow you to collaborate with us to keep independent music alive, and be a part of an inspired, authentic creative process in a highly commercialized industry.</strong> Music that genuinely comes from the heart is a universal language and connects all walks of life. It's one of the few things in life that can bring hope and change to us all.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why Should I Donate?</h3>
<p><strong>This new album is going to be the pinnacle of everything we've done up to this point, and we've poured our very existence into the writing process for this release.</strong> We've also vowed to ourselves to not settle for anything less than full creative expression and realization of our vision. The recording process for our past albums - which have received a fair amount of recognition - was a little more straightforward: we wrote the songs, recorded the songs in a studio, and released the songs. <strong>This time, we came together and</strong> <strong>decided to take an entirely different approach to making music and connecting to the community through our music. Working together with our dear friend and producer, Jack Frost, the process of writing this new album has been much more in-depth, creatively driven and inspired than any of our previous albums</strong>, so we expect to far exceed our past successes with this strong new direction, drive and confidence in the power of the songs. We're also really reaching for a larger audience with the content, production and stylistic vision of this new album, and doing it in a way that stays true to our own creative aspirations. In addition, <strong>we're donating a portion of the funds to an undeniably righteous non-profit, Half the Sky Movement, which aims to empower oppressed women and girls all over the world.</strong> When you add all of these factors together, you get a project that will not only be immensely helped by the community, but will also be of great benefit to the community, making it hard to think of a reason to not donate.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So Where Do the Funds Go?</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>Your donations are going directly into the quality and reach of our new album.</strong> The primary goal is to pay for expenses related to the recording and duplication of the music. We need some seed money to be allocated towards gear for our home studio, to get the ball rolling on the recording process. We have spent the last several years building up our home studio, but still need additional, essential pieces to complete a professional workspace. Microphones, an audio interface and software plug-ins are among the big-ticket items, which are all spelled out in our budget below. This will allow us to complete basic tracking and overdubs on our own, rather than pay others for their studio time. <strong>It's the whole owning vs. renting paradigm and it will apply to all current and future recording projects.</strong> After the album is funded, the rest of our funds will be spent on promotion to get our album out into the world. It doesn't make sense to have a great product if nobody hears it, so we're hiring a trusted and established PR firm. In addition, we're donating a portion of the funds to Half the Sky Movement, a wonderful global non-profit whose goal is to put an end to the oppression of women and girls worldwide.</span></p>

<p>WORK. PARTY. GROOVE.  Three words BELOW THE TIDE honor every day.</p>
<p>BTT is a 5 piece blue-collar deathcore band based out of Kent, Ohio. We as a band have spent the last few years building towards the beast we've become and are now a dominating force in the DIY metal circuit. We have a fondness for the extreme and a tendency to party hearty, and we want to bring our party to YOU! 2013 brings a whole new level of intensity for both our live performance and our music, with our full-length album having just been released this summer and a music video not far behind!</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise funds in order for us to obtain 2 new t-shirts, restock our old t-shirts, and help to fund the various short tours we have planned for the end of Summer and Fall of 2013! We live and breathe this band every day, and you could say we’re a band of brothers. We’re just five guys that want to have a good time. We don't go to parties; we ARE the party. Help us to bring it to you!!!</p>
<p>We’re looking to raise $2,000 so that we can not only restock our Skull Island t-shirts, but also get TWO BRAND NEW SHIRTS printed and available for you! Along with bringing you new merch, your donation also helps us get a few miles further on the road. As a touring band, we can’t always count on guarantees at shows, thus forcing us to fund things out of pocket.

With your help we can keep the proverbial ball rolling and come hang out and party with you on your turf!</p>
<p>In return for your donation, we’re providing “perks” - stickers, cd’s, posters, shirts, music video guest appearances, and even a night on the town with the BTT boys that we’re giving to you as a thank you for your pledge. Even if we don’t reach our goal, you still get your perks for your donation, and the money that we do make is still going towards our merch and tour funds. We pinch pennies, and make every penny count!</p>
<p>Below the Tide has been stirring the waters of the metal industry for the past three years and we’re now taking the strides necessary to ascend beyond the state of a local act and step towards an international position in our industry. Each member has extensive experience in our local and national music industry and have plenty of band experience over the past decade. We LOVE what we do!</p>

BTT is a 5 piece blue-collar deathcore band based out of Kent, Ohio. We as a band have spent the last few years building towards the beast we've become and are now a dominating force in the DIY metal circuit. We have a fondness for the extreme and a tendency to party hearty, and we want to bring our party to YOU! 2013 brings a whole new level of intensity for both our live performance and our music, with our full-length album having just been released this summer and a music video not far behind!
The goal of this campaign is to raise funds in order for us to obtain 2 new t-shirts, restock our old t-shirts, and help to fund the various short tours we have planned for the end of Summer and Fall of 2013! We live and breathe this band every day, and you could say we’re a band of brothers. We’re just five guys that want to have a good time. We don't go to parties; we ARE the party. Help us to bring it to you!!!
We’re looking to raise $2,000 so that we can not only restock our Skull Island t-shirts, but also get TWO BRAND NEW SHIRTS printed and available for you!

<h3><strong>GOALS OF THE PROJECT </strong></h3>
<p>101A SERBIAN TOUR is a project that aims to:<br/> - Promote the music of the 101A to people of Serbia (down are listed tour details)<br/> - Enhance  the promotion of  the biggest festival of Japanese pop culture, that is  JAPANIZAM Convention with 101A live performance<br/> - Spread the promotion of Japanese culture throughout Serbia<br/> - Share the music globally (Serbian tour is one way to promote the band and to use this opportunity to share music worldwide)<br/> - STIMULATE OTHER FANS  TO BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IF YOU FOLLOW YOUR PASSION AND IDEA!<br/> - STIMULATE MUSICIANS THAT GREAT WORK IS RECOGNIZED AND SUPPORTED</p>
<p><strong>Project description:</strong><br/> From July 3<sup>rd</sup> until July 14<sup>th</sup>, the band 101A will perform at various locations in Serbia and promote and participate in social activities of JAPANIZAM Convention.</p>

<strong>ABOUT</strong> US</h2>
<p>IDEATORS OF SERBIAN TOUR AND SUPPORTERS OF 101A: <strong>FESTINA LENTE, CRV2Studio &amp; Trablmejker</strong></p>
<p><strong>Festina Lente</strong> is a publishing house from Serbia. They are promoting 101A band on their website and  other social networks. Together with CRV2Studio, they contributed to the making of music video for the 101A track  “Forbidden Sky”, from their new astoundingly ambitious album, soon to be released.<br/> Festina Lente is the only Serbian publishing house that is about to  publish mangas in Serbia. The first manga to be published in Festina Lente is IKIGAMI from the author Motoro Mase. The manga was originally published by Shogakukan Inc. Tokyo.  Band 101A was the first connection with   Japanese culture and the subsequent motivation to share  it for Festina Lente. Therefore, the band  will take part in promotion of IKIGAMI and  in that way, they will contribute to the cultural exchange by sharing   what they are  best in…  MUSIC.</p>

101A & SERBIAN TOUR

 
“101A is not your normal bend. This trio of gender-bending name trickery are very much twisting the rules of  convention with their music and image. One thing is for sure, they’re here to stay. Rock on!” (from IN THE RED, international urban culture & fashion magazine from Guangzhou, China)
The alternative rock band 101A (Noa, Sally and the K) is coming this July to Serbia (101A SERBIAN TOUR) or the first time, as ambassadors of Japanese music and pop-culture. The start and  highlight of their tour will be JAPANIZAM Convention which celebrates Japanese pop-culture and is the biggest event of this kind in the region of South-East Europe  The tour will end with the band’s playing at the EXIT festival (www.exitfest.org)
Official website:www.101a.org
 


 
GOALS OF THE PROJECT 
101A SERBIAN TOUR is a project that aims to: - Promote the music of the 101A to people of Serbia (down are listed tour details) - Enhance  the promotion of  the biggest festival of Japanese pop culture, that is  JAPANIZAM Convention with 101A live performance - Spread the promotion of Japanese culture throughout Serbia - Share the music globally (Serbian tour is one way to promote the band and to use this opportunity to share music worldwide) - STIMULATE OTHER FANS  TO BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IF YOU FOLLOW YOUR PASSION AND IDEA! - STIMULATE MUSICIANS THAT GREAT WORK IS RECOGNIZED AND SUPPORTED
Project description: From July 3rd until July 14th, the band 101A will perform at various locations in Serbia and promote and participate in social activities of JAPANIZAM Convention.
These events will be followed by publishing house FESTINA LENTE, documented by CRV2Studio (who made the music video for the band in Tokyo, Japan) and promoted by many Serbian channels and portals and associations,  among which are TRABLMEJKER, one of TOP3 leading webzines, and SAKURABANA Association, the organizer of JAPANIZAM Convention. 
This project s will gather around about 10.000 attendees ( at gigs and  JAPANIZAM Convention). The prospective audience reach of the project is significantly higher, if  in it are included all those reached through media coverage  and (social) networks of organizers. 
WE SUPPORT RECOGNIZED QUALITY
With joined forces (strong will and funding), Festina Lente publishing house, CRV2Studio and 101A band, self-funded the 1st part of the entire operation, provided all of the material that is already posted on our networks and that will be shown at JAPANIZAM festival (including music video and documentary of the band and two other Japanese artists).
Our idea and wish to share  their music led us forward. OUR BUDGET  NOW STARTS TO ABANDON OUR AMBITION!!! (Did we mention it’s our private budget?)

Festina Lente is a publishing house from Serbia. They are promoting 101A band on their website and  other social networks. Together with CRV2Studio, they contributed to the making of music video for the 101A track  “Forbidden Sky”, from their new astoundingly ambitious album, soon to be released.

Therefore, the band  will take part in promotion of IKIGAMI and  in that way, they will contribute to the cultural exchange by sharing   what they are  best in…  MUSIC.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Jane Ehrhardt and I am a singer-songwriter based in Quebec City, Canada. I began songwriting as a teenager and I have been honing my craft ever since. I decided to devote my life to this passion around seven years ago. Since then, I have put out a few releases. My last two albums were distributed across Canada and they received a good deal of critical acclaim as well as airplay on the CBC and various campus radio stations. I have also done a lot of touring and intend on continuing to do so. Over the years, I have performed a couple hundred concerts across Eastern Canada. My last album came out at the beginning of 2011, and if I want my career to keep moving forward, the time has come for me to release some new material!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In June 2013, I recorded 11 new songs with my band made up of Hugo Le Malt (electric guitar, mandolin, lapsteel), Grégoire Dufour (bass, piano) and Renaud Pilote (drums). Simon Paradis engineered the sessions that were held in a century old farmhouse in Quebec’s Beauce region (see above video). Simon is also co-producing the album with me. I have been working on this very personal collection of songs for the past couple of years and I daresay that they are some of my best yet! As for the production, we wanted to go for a very natural, warm and live sound. I believe we have succeeded as Simon describes it as sounding reminiscent of old Neil Young barn recordings.  Everyone involved is very excited to get these recordings out to the public! </p>
<p></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In order to properly release these recordings in a professional manner, we are calling on our dear friends, families and supporters to give us a hand! Our goal is to raise $3000. Firstly, the funds raised will go towards getting the album mixed and mastered, which are two necessary steps in creating an album which sounds coherent and professional. The rest will go towards manufacturing the CDs, designing the album packaging with a professional graphic designer, and creating a promotional video for the album. If we manage to surpass our goal, we will be able to invest more in the CD packaging, the video and promotional tools such as a website. In exchange for your contribution, I am offering a wide array of perks for different budgets that range from the digital download of the new album, to my complete discovery, to original artwork and intimate live performances!  P.S. All perks include the price of delivery. Send me a message if you would like for your copy of the CD to be signed!</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We all know that the music industry is not what it once was, but I truly believe that music remains alive and well in the hearts and lives of so many. It is an extraordinary means of communication that must not be taken for granted. By contributing to this project, you will be helping me to share with the world the most beautiful and original music that I have to offer! All funds raised will go directly into the project, whether the goal is met or not, and you will be able to hear the fruits of your contribution as soon as the album comes out. </p>
<br/><p></p>

</h3><h3>Who am I?</h3>
<div>My name is BenJamin Wallen and I am a graduate of Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. My love for live music and movies have led me to start shooting concerts. I started in 2012 with my little 10 megapixel Pentax K200d and have been using it every since. I want to continue to shoot great live music moments for people to share and enjoy! You are here to help that dream come true. The fundraising is fixed, so it is all or nothing. </div>
<div>I need new gear in order to stay current and step up my game. My eye is sharp, I just need the right gear to capture what I see. </div>
<br/>
<h3>Bottom Line:</h3><div>I need a better camera! In order to shoot concerts you need a camera with great sensitivity, noise control and a fast shutter. Capturing fast moving objects, with constantly changing light in a near dark scenarios is a very difficult thing to do. Your funding will allow me to do this. <br/><br/>With your donation I will be buying a new Body. The camera lenses I have already will do the trick. The camera is what I need to desperately upgrade. </div><ul>
<li>The Camera is a Pentax K-5ii. Not top of the line, but excels where I need it most</li>
<li>If I reach the goal for the body, I will increase the goal to include a fast zoom lens. </li>
<li>The zoom lens is the next step for any concert photog to get close, when they can't physically get close. They are pricey and have been left off this campaign for right now. </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>If you donate it will give me the ability to follow my dream: </p><ul>
<li>Live music will be captured for thousands to enjoy.</li>
<li>I have shot many bands in the SF Bay Area and plan to shoot more.</li>
<li>I have been used to shoot Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, Aftershock Festival and Hangtown Halloween Ball.</li>
<li>Bands I have also shot are:

Unfulfilled by the audience/performer relationship, they questioned ""setting"" as the infrastructure for dynamic performance. By the time they met pianist Jeremy Rafal in the Spring of 2013, redefining how the audience could interact with performing artists became a pillar for the organization. These diverse musicians make up Glasskin Arts, an organization that fuses multiple art forms to cultivate a platform showcasing dynamic collaborations. Whether the focus be an exploration of space, or the relationship between disparate art forms, Glasskin Arts will consistently question the current climate for classical and new musics. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Born in the Philippines and raised in Hawaii, pianist <b>Jeremy Rafal</b> has been called “a sterling musician” distinguished by “sensitivity and natural realization of phrasing and shaping of musical lines (The Journal Standard, Freeport, IL).”  He is a soloist, collaborative artist, music director, teacher, and composer.  Now a resident of New York City, he has performed across the United States, Europe, and Asia..  Jeremy had his share of honors, having received prizes from the Brevard Music Center Piano Competition, the Indiana State MTNA Collegiate Performance Competition, the Shostakovich International Piano Competition of St. Petersburg, Russia, among others.  Currently, he is focused on working collaboratively with other artists from theater artists to visual artists.  He holds a master’s degree from University of Cincinnati, and a doctorate from Indiana University.<br/></p>
<p><b> Frédérique Gnaman </b>is a violinist living and working in New York City. She started violin at the age of 9 and by 11 was accepted into the New England Conservatory Preparatory School where she studied with Matthew Green. She then went on to study violin under Gregory Fulkerson at New York Unversity's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. She graduated in May 2013 with a Bachelor of Music Degree at NYU and currently works as a freelance musician in New York City.</p>
<p> As a young musician, clarinetist <b>Ricky McWain</b> sat 2nd chair Bass Clarinet at All-State Band for Bass Clarinet and played 2nd Clarinet in the inaugural Macy's Great American Marching Band as one of four representatives from the state of Kentucky. At NYU, Ricky has played principal clarinet on <em>Le boeuf sur le toit  </em>by Darius Milhaud and other works in NYU's Philharmonia as well as performed in chamber recitals at The White Box Gallery and Gallery onetwentyeight.  He now works for NYU Residential Life as an Resident Assistant, and is finishing a B.A. in Music with a double major in Romance Language at NYU's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. He studies privately with Dr. Esther Lamneck. </p>

Whether personal or professional, that’s what makes our daily lives
interesting.  Can we get to the
destination we are striving for? 
Musicians and athletes face a stark reality.  Ever since we pick up the 
guitar, or throw a
ball, it’s all about letting our imagination run wild with endless 
possibilities.  Eventually our skills, developed over years,
begin to get us noticed.  At one point,
we reach our limitations and realize it’s time to move on.  Whether the 
girlfriend get’s pregnant, or you
blowout a knee, something happens that dictates how things are going to 
be
played out. In many instances, you get
one last shot at glory.  For us, that opportunity
has come knocking.  With the help of
Carmen Marotta, we’ve been introduced to Tony Braunagal.  Tony is a 
legend in the blues community.  He’s done it all on the stage and in the
studio.  He writes, plays, and
produces.  He’s probably one of the most
creative guys we’re ever going to get a chance to work with.  That’s
where you come in… Currently, we are lacking the resources to make a 
career
defining studio recording.  But, with a
little help from our friends, we could make it happen.  Please consider 
getting involved with this
project. Support the arts!  Support Rock n Roll!  Support some musicians
 cranking it up on the
Jersey Shore!</p>
<p>If you’ve never been involved with something like this, you
might ask…”what are they going to do with this money?”  It’s simple… there are numerous elements to
making a recording.  The funds we raise
will cover studio costs such as recording and mixing.  We need to pay Tony.  Other areas of expenditure are mastering,
manufacturing, and, of course, promotion. 
All sorts of things come into
the equation.  If we decide to record a
Beatles tune, you have to pay the piper! 
Don’t worry…Billy won’t be buying another Fender!</p>
<p>We’ve come up with some interesting perks for those that
chose to get involved.  Our friend Tom in
Hawaii tracked a bunch of shows for us. 
He’s mixed some tracks and we will be giving out a brand new live
recording.  Glen Gray has designed a cool
“rock clock” for us incorporating the Billy Walton Band logo.  Award winning 
Chef Richard Spurlock will be cooking dinner for everyone at our
exclusive CD release show.  Of course,
the “entree” will be the music.  Billy
has some special guest appearances in the works as well.</p>
<p>The last time we organized a “fan funding” campaign we were
successful.  Please help us continue that
momentum.  We will be on tour in Europe
for a good part of November.  You’ll
probably be reading this while we’re pulling into our show in Berlin…or London…or
Cologne… It’s been a hard ride.  A
successful campaign with Indiegogo  would
propel us to new heights!</p>

<p>We are an odd mix
from different backgrounds on the same page about making didgeridoo infused hip
hop/funk/folk - whatever you wanna call it! We are raising funds to release and
promote our debut album and future music videos. We also plan to promote the
“Yam” music video over this coming Thanksgiving (yam season). Our perks include the debut album itself (physical and digital
form), private didgeridoo lessons, poster art and more! We thank you and appreciate any
support you can give us and hope our perks will be of infinite value to
you! </p>

</span><b>                                                 ABOUT
GORANGUTANG</b></p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Gorangutang: Half
gorilla, half orangutan. This hybrid creature is known for its strong thumping
of the forest floor to mark it's territory, powerful bass-heavy calls and
unpredictable swings through the upper canopy.  We (William Thoren and
Tra'zae Lewis Clinton) first met in Berlin, Germany during the 2011 George
Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic tour.  It was Thanksgiving Day and the
first time either of us had traveled with P Funk outside of the USA. Strangely,
less than a year from our Thanksgiving meeting we ended up cutting our first
song together: ""Yam"".  Over the last year we have been making
music together in hotels, buses, planes and anywhere else we find ourselves
touring with P Funk and or at home in our ""gorabitat"". </p>
<p>·<span>  </span></p>
<p>·<span>  </span>William Thoren is an LA
based didgeridoo crafter, performer and photographer. He has been playing
didgeridoo for thirteen years and started touring with George Clinton and P Funk
as their photographer in 2011. Tra'zae is the grandson of George Clinton and
learned to rhyme before he could speak. He is a multi instrumentalist with a focus on keyboard and a prolific producer of various styles of music.</p>

</span><b>                                                 ABOUT THIS
CAMPAIGN</b></p>
<p>·<span>  </span>We have started this
campaign to ask for help in getting the music we have created together over the
last year out to the world! If successful, this campaign will allow us to put
everything aside and focus on the release of our music far sooner then we will
be able to with our current financial obstacles. We have learned that social
media outreach alone is not enough for good promotion. Most of the major and
indie artists we love have had a ton of promotional
budget behind their music to get it to listeners. </p>
<p>·<span>  </span></p>
<p>·<span>  </span>We are taking the
independent route and have found a few good companies and outlets for promoting
our upcoming music and videos. One of these companies is Hip Video Promo who
will help get our videos on MTV, VH1, BET and a long list of other networks and
online media outlets. The music industry is in a state of transformation and we
feel blessed to have access to the many new opportunities for independent artists. We are big dreamers and each of us tends to constantly take on more then we can realistically achieve by ourselves. We have our creative flow down but now we are reaching out to our community for help in releasing the works we have created. With this campaign we hope to gain support from those who believe in us enough to help release the Gorangutang into the wild! Lastly, every didge player knows the world is hugely lacking in didgeridoo.</p>
<p><b>                                                           OUR OBSTACLES</b></p>
<p>First of all we feel
amazingly blessed to be living the lives we live amongst such an amazing and
diverse group of people! We are blessed to even see it as a possibility that
our community might support us in achieving our true dreams and we appreciate
any kind of support we get - even if you are just putting a lil extra syrup on
a yam for us! </p>
<p>One of our main obstacles
is distance. Tra'zae lives in Las Vegas and William Lives in Los Angeles. We
spend more time together on the road with P Funk then we do at either of our
homes. All the music we have recorded is getting finalized and mixed in Los
Angeles so part of the budget will go towards travel expenses between cities. </p>
<p>Tra'zae has three young
kids with his wife in Las Vegas and time away from them is taken very
seriously. There is often a pressure to spend our time together playing shows
or street performing to cover Greyhound tickets and gas expenses rather than
focus on releasing our creations. William runs a large didgeridoo crafting shop
in LA that he is currently in the process of downsizing. He will be moving from
a large shop to a smaller one over the next two months. This move combined with
Will's habit of didgeridoo evolution over profits will leave little room for
the excesses of funding this album project anytime soon. </p>
<p>With that said, every
extra cent we have has been and will continue going into our music! If this
campaign is successful it will feel like winning the lottery of our dreams. It
will empower us to live our someday dreams now and if you help us achieve this
we promise to strive for nothing less then making music history! </p>

Six finalists have been chosen; two graduate students and four undergraduate students.  All six will be brought to Atlanta to participate in this two-day festival.  The first part, held Friday evening, will be the dress rehearsal of their pieces, followed by a welcome reception for the judges, finalists, and DCG singers. On Saturday morning, a half-day roundtable discussion will be held with the finalists, judges, and DCG members to discuss career opportunities, publication issues for composers, the job market in Georgia and the Southeast, current trends in professional music, and other matters of keen interest to the finalists.  The festival culminates with a concert Saturday evening for an anticipated audience of approximately 300 – 400 people, which will introduce these composers and their works to today’s audience.  Following the musical debut, the composers and the professional judges will discuss together in public the merits of their pieces in a high-level feedback session seldom if ever available to them.  This will give these young composers an unusual opportunity to be introduced to the Georgia music community, for the public to hear the latest music being produced in Georgia colleges and universities, and for the young composers to learn how more experienced composers view their work.   The two Grand Prizes are DCG-funded $1000 scholarship stipends, one presented to a graduate and one to an undergraduate student, to help support their compositional studies. </p><p></p><p>This is a unique opportunity for the young composers and our community.  Please take time to acquaint yourself with the finalists who's pictures and bios are listed in the gallery section of this campaign.  </p><p>We hope that you will consider making a donation the GYCF.  Thank you in advance for your generous financial support!</p><p></p><p><b>About the DeKalb Choral Guild (DCG):</b></p><p>The mission of the DeKalb Choral Guild is to create opportunities for our community to experience and be enriched by excellent choral music.</p><p>The DCG was created in 1978 to present classical choral music of many styles and traditions to audiences in greater Atlanta.  Guild members are selected by audition every year from many counties, but focus on serving DeKalb County.  During its 35-year history, DCG has distinguished itself by the variety of pieces performed and by performing newer works by living composers.  Between September and May each year, DCG rehearses and performs four concerts locally, including a special holiday concert.  During different summers over the past several decades, DCG has travelled to Italy, Vatican City, Germany, and Great Britain to sing classical choral music in churches and cathedrals, including being invited to sing for the 5 pm Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica four years ago.</p><br/><p></p></div>","Watch the video to find out more about the Georgia Young Composer's Festival and meet our 2014 finalists!About the Project:The third Georgia Young Composers Festival (GYCF) will take place February 7-8, 2014 at our resident home, Avondale Estates First Baptist Church.  The two previous GYCFs were sponsored and produced by DCG in 2009 and 2012.  The upcoming festival is a collegiate choral composition competition for young musicians living or studying anywhere in Georgia.

</div></div>","Hi guys and gals,

Over the past 3 years, in between writing, recording and performing with my band Heaven Is Where, I've also been writing a slew of acoustic songs. I've narrowed it down to the ones that mean the most to me and would be so grateful for your support in making the dream of recording a full length acoustic album a reality. Ya'll have always been there when I've needed my spirits lifted from some amazingly tough times...Many of you never even knowing what has gone on and how much your kind words and support have pulled me through. This album will take you through my journey to hell and back. Should I be able to raise the funds to make it happen, it will be justly called ""Welcome Home The Child"".Thank you all so very much.~ Matt

Pandora sends you sterile genotypes of music it has decided you’ll like (and jacks artists with low payout).
You can listen to your digital music on public transit but where’s the artistic delight in stuffing sounds directly into your ear-bone? 

Serendipity is an actual, real-life, solid-as-a . . . well, solid-as-a-vinyl-record vinyl record (oh, and it's clear). It will be made in an actual, real-life, solid-as-a-big-building-filled-with-a-lot-of-machines vinyl record factory in Cleveland, Ohio.It comes in a beautifully designed album cover (I’m sorry—your mp3 didn’t come wrapped in a piece of custom artwork? Oh gee that’s too bad). And more importantly than any of that, Serendipity will feature the songs of 8 FANTASTIC independent artists:
Coo Coo BirdsKara Hesse
Crashing Hotels
Dubious Ranger
Way Jose
Should We Run
Lyttle King
Tino Drima

(We'll be alternating their videos here on Indiegogo daily.)You are going to love sliding this record out of its lusciously illustrated cover, carefully lowering it onto the spindle of your turntable, touching the needle to the vinyl, hearing the first pre-song scratchings, and letting these tunes flow over you. How serendipitous that you will be able to fund this project.  

Pulse Music is helping independent artists produce beautiful vinyl records. The funds we raise go to: -our artists so they can keep making the music they love -our manufacturing partnersand, finally, to us. We are a small, cuddly company in San Francisco made up of people who are determined that independent music shall not vanish from the face of the earth.

In the unlikely event of a water landing (i.e., we don’t reach our funding goal) Pulse Music covers all costs. We just don’t think that sticking artists with the bill is cool.

High Quality digital files if you support us. And if you REALLY want to help us
out and be a part of this project, then you will receive a limited edition
vinyl with YOUR name written on the Album's Artwork. Why Vinyl? A Vinyl not
only sounds great, but looks great as well! A vinyl sleeve is the perfect
canvas for artwork, and in this case, we are extremely happy to have original
drawings by Pawel Kuczynski! Each vinyl will be numbered: 0-500. In the end,
you will not only have the highest quality Digital Audio files to add to your
computer, phone, and mp3 player, but you will also have a piece of art you will
be able to hold in your hands and showcase. Even if you don't own a vinyl

(Texto en ESPAÑOL más abajo)I am
Nelson, and I am a composer.
One thing I love as much as music is Space. 
I want to record an album with original compositions inspired by the different stages a star goes through during its life cycle. I also want the music to be representative of our connection to the stars. So alongside molecular
clouds, protostars and red giants, I composed about human existence.
My plan is to take this conceptual performance to schools, universities and to the general public, and hopefully spark their curiosity about Space and our place in it. For this, I collaborated with Dutch astronaut André Kuipers (who has gone twice to Space for a total of 204 days); He recorded an educational/inspirational video where he talks about stellar evolution and our direct connection to it. This video will be projected on stage during every performance we give.
Help us spark curiosity about Space and our place in it!!!

Here is where the money will go:
Recording Studio, Mixing and Mastering: We will record in the incredible
Fattoria Musica (Studio A). This will ensure a high quality recording thanks to
their amazing instruments, acoustics and engineers. 
http://www.fattoriamusica.de/
Vinyl Press: CDs have been devalued by the download of digital files. The
problem with this is that sound quality is lost, and the connection between a
person and a record is diminished. This is why you will be able to download
High Quality digital files if you support us. And if you REALLY want to help us
out and be a part of this project, then you will receive a limited edition
vinyl with YOUR name written on the Album's Artwork. Why Vinyl? A Vinyl not
only sounds great, but looks great as well! A vinyl sleeve is the perfect
canvas for artwork, and in this case, we are extremely happy to have original
drawings by Pawel Kuczynski! Each vinyl will be numbered: 0-500. In the end,
you will not only have the highest quality Digital Audio files to add to your
computer, phone, and mp3 player, but you will also have a piece of art you will
be able to hold in your hands and showcase. Even if you don't own a vinyl
player, you are getting a valuable collector's item that will be with you
forever. And above all, you would be helping us greatly! :)
We will do our vinyl pressings with Record Industry to ensure a high
quality product.
 http://www.recordindustry.com/
Album's Artwork: I believe an Album's Artwork is very important. It provides a
visual layer that complements the listening experience. That is why I decided
to work with an artist I deeply admire: Pawel Kuckzynski (Rewarded with over
100 prizes and distinctions).
Here is
one of the drawings he made for this project:






If you
haven't seen his art yet, check out his facebook page:

TEXTO EN ESPAÑOL

Soy Nelson y
soy un compositor.

Mi infancia estuvo llena de sueños
espaciales. Recuerdo mirar hacia el cielo en las noches, y dejar que mi
imaginación me llevara alrededor de esas esferas brillantes. De niño no sólo
vivía en el Planeta Tierra; Vivía en el Universo. Pero al crecer, me mude a
ciudades más grandes y más pobladas, dónde las luces de las calles remplazaron
a las estrellas. Sin darme cuenta había cambiado al Universo por un barrio, la
Vía Láctea por una autopista, y mis fantasías sobre naves espaciales por una
licencia de conducir.
Pero la fascinación por el espacio
nunca me dejó.
Quería
combinar mi amor por la música y por el espacio, así que compuse una obra
inspirada en el ciclo de vida de una estrella, desde su nacimiento hasta su
muerte. Con la ayuda de 4 de los músicos más talentosos que conozco, hemos
trabajado en este proyecto desde hace un año, y finalmente estamos listos para
grabarlo y compartirlo con el mundo.
Quiero
grabar un disco que represente no solo mis intereses, sino también mi deseo de
compartir las cosas que me sorprenden sobre estar vivo.
Necesito
tu ayuda para grabar, mezclar, masterizar y finalmente llevar la música a
copias físicas, para así poder compartir mis composiciones y ojala generar
curiosidad sobre el espacio y nuestro lugar en él.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ok so here's the breakdown!!!</p>
<p>Fireset is an indie-folk band who sets out to awaken listeners into a new kind of worship unlike ever before.  With emphasis on the craft of music and the word of God within, this small group out of Pembroke, NC aims to set an uncontainable fire to the nations.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have spent the past two years writing and performing</li>
<li>We have faced obstacle after obstacle when it comes to recording</li>
<li>We decided to do it ourselves, invested in equipment, recieved tons of help, and independently recorded the entire album.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where you come in!!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Recording took countless hours, sweat, tears, some blood, and gallons of caffiene.  Now we are ready to produce.  That being said...</p>
<ul>
<li>We need $500 to mass produce the album into distributable hard copies</li>
<li>On this album you get pounding bass, hand clapping, toe tapping rythm, with fingerpicking fun that you can scream out to as you bring glory to he father.</li>
<li>The goal goes towards casing, replication, and production in its entirety.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If each person on our fan page donates a mere $2.00, our goal will be blown out of the water so by all means, please know that every bit counts.  We know the internet is a great way to access music and the album could be put there for free.  But the word of God ison the internet and we see how many people need a personal encounter. You could make that happen.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to participate financially in this effort, PRAY!!! Please also share with anyone and everyone not only what we are trying to do but the gospel and love of Christ.  That is the point to begin with. THANKS SO MUCH GUYS!!!</p>

<p><strong><br/></strong>We are a relatively small post-hardcore/rock band from San Antonio, Tx with a passion for what we do.

<p>The only problem with all of that is that even though our music has been making its way across the world slowly but surely, our money has not. We are an unsigned band, therefore we pay for everything out of our own pockets. This makes recording scarce, and a big project is something we know we cannot take on all by ourselves. It's been a dream of ours to play music for people, travel the world and meet people who our music has made some kind of impact in their lives.</p>
<p>We are not just six men looking to get rich or trying to get girls by showing off. This is our passion, our life and hopefully, our career. If you decide to contribute to our project, you would be responsible for starting us off on the road to the rest of our lives.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>S</strong>o we are a hard rock band called Another Distraction.  We are based in Clifton, NJ, and have been playing hard rock for the past two years.  In the last 8 months many things have changed.  A new singer was acquired, new songs were written, and momentum changed drastically.  Since January we have played several shows around NJ, NY, and PA.  We've also played a few battle of the bands, one that we are currently in for for Fright Fest, and we were in the running to play this years Warped Tour as well.  We've been working hard and passionately to perfect our show and our music throughout the months and finally feel that we are ready to share our music with the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>W</strong>hat you are contributing to is a dream. A dream that we have shared since day one.  We're excited to get this project off the ground, and looking forward to getting into the studio to start recording.  With your help and continued support this dream can become a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A</strong>lright, so at this point you probably want to know what your money specifically is going towards and what you get for your contributions.  Bullet points shall be needed! So our goal for this project is $6,000.  If we get more great, but we would be more than happy with just the asking goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Goal - $6,000</li>
<li>That money will go towards the Production of:</li>
<li>Studio Album</li>
<li>Music Video</li>
<li>and Merchandise like Shirts and Posters</li>
</ul>
<p>What you get, and we are truly excited about these rewards, are as followed (In a nutshell).</p>
<ul>
<li>$10 gets you the full album plus it will be signed by the entire band</li>
<li>$20 gets you the signed album plus a t-shirt</li>
<li>$50 gets you all that plus you'll be able to come and record vocals with us at the studio</li>
<li>$100 gets you all that good stuff plus you get to also be in our music video</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many other rewards, but we figured we would mention the top ones first.</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>o if we don't reach the full goal of $6,000 then whatever money we do attain will fully go to the production of the album, and a few of the perks mentioned will still be rewarded of course.</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>ince we have been playing out we have had nothing but good reviews from both the audience and other bands that we have played with.  One question that had been continuously asked was if we had an album to buy.  And with disappointed faces we had to tell everyone who asked that we didn't currently, but that we wanted to have an album, but financially just couldn't afford it.  This is not just for us, but for our current and future listeners to hear the music that we have dedicated the past few years of our lives to.  We are just super excited for everything that is happening right now! </p>
<p><strong>W</strong>e completely understand if you can not contribute financially, but if you would still like to help get the word out for this project you can post the link to this page on your facebook or twitter.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Again, we thank you for all the help and contributions all of you are willing to give.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul><li>Hi everyone! Thank you so much for taking the time to watch and listen! My name is Ida fLO. I am an <i>indie pop artist</i> based out of San Francisco, CA. Writing and making music has always been a predominant part of my life. About 3 years ago, I began pursuing it as a career. During this time I have had the opportunity to perform all around the Bay Area and as far as Los Angeles and New York, collaborating with the many talents of the arts and performing arts community. I've been heavily involved in each aspect of my career so far. Managing, booking, promoting, etc. and producing, songwriting, choreographing, etc. As an <i>independent artist</i>, it is a lot to take in at first, but the supportive people I've been so blessed to be surrounded by helped make this journey immensely positive.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Currently, I am in the process of producing my next <i>music video</i>, ""Plastic"". The track got such a great buzz from my team that it had to take the next step and become a <i>music video</i>! With that said, there's a lot involved in this process. There is of course the careful planning and creative meetings, but there are several key ingredients needed to make this video a success:</li></ul>
<p>1) Hire Videographer/Director and Team</p>
<p>2) Rent equipment</p>
<p>3) Rent location for video</p>
<p>4) Hire MUA's/Hairstylist/'Set' Staff</p>
<p>5) Hire Dancers/Actors/Models</p>
<p>6) Rent rehearsal/studio space</p>
<p>7) Taking care of travel, food, gas expenses of crew and cast</p>
<p>8) Get final cut of track Mixed and Mastered for high quality sound<br/></p>
<p>9) Get video edited (Visual/Special Effects)<br/></p>
<p>10) Invest in video <b><i>promotion</i></b> (This is a BIG one, Post Production)</p>
<ul><li>This is why this project needs your help! Independently, I could never cover these costs on my own. With your help, you could share a part of this video's potential success, and my success as an artist! It all starts with you! </li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'd like to take this time now to go more into detail about this project. The song and video is called ""Plastic"". It is mainly about what women do to their bodies to make themselves feel more ""beautiful"". I say <i><b>more</b></i> beautiful, because I feel strongly about how we should already see ourselves. As beautiful, inside and out.</p>
<p>""Plastic"" exposes plastic surgery among the countless other ways women mold their bodies to their ideals. The song and video will focus on this, but is not intended to ridicule those who partake in aesthetically transforming their bodies. </p>
<p>I only shine a light on the subject to understand, and to help others understand that who you are right now is beautiful... So <i><b>embrace</b></i> it!</p>

With sites like this and people like you we want to prove that it’s viable to be a completely independent band in the ever-changing landscape of what its like to be an up-and-coming band.WHAT WE NEED… AND WHAT YOU GETFrom the ground up, we put everything we can into our music. We produce and record in our own studio, film music videos and do our own photography. But we can’t do everything by ourselves. We want to provide our listeners with the best experience possible, and that’s where you come in.We realize we're asking for a lot of money, but allow us to lay it all out for you. We put every cent and opportunity we get to good use. If we don't get to our final goal, these are the stages of what your money can do for us. At $3000, we get our album professionally mixed and mastered and get it up online, available to download for free. At $4300, we can afford to also get a CD pressing done. At $7000 we can also get it pressed on high quality audiophile vinyl.We appreciate every bit of support we've gotten along the way. If you are willing to help with this endeavour, we want to give something back as a sign of our gratitude.As we launch the second album, it will be free online (always!) as well as for sale at all major online retailers. The physical formats will be sold on the tour behind it and in independent record shops as we hope to expansively tour behind this album. Always keeping the music free will hopefully inspire people to buy it anyway and support the band.  So, if this funding platform is really as awesome and charitable as we hear… we thank you in advance. You're not just funding an album, you're giving a hard-working band a great opportunity. 

Thanks for reading, and if you like what you hear then help CYGNETS... and spread the word!

<div>""The D"" - the official unofficial theme song of Detroit - a record, video, and documentary of a joyous citywide singalong tribute to the Motor City and its people. Written by Detroit-born Grammy winner Allee Willis with Andrae Alexander in the same uplifting spirit as Willis' first hit, ""September"" by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, ""The D"" will be recorded and filmed this September, performed by thousands of Detroiters singing, playing, dancing, clapping, whistling, breathing fire, juggling hubcaps, and showing their spirit any way they can all over the city. <em>Everyone</em> in Detroit is invited to participate, so this is truly a ""Made in Detroit"" effort, creating a musical theme for the Motor City's renaissance<em>. (Hear a demo of the song by hitting the “gallery” tab above the video on this page.)</em>
</div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div><strong>WHO AM I?:</strong></div>
<div>Allee Willis - Grammy, Emmy, Tony and Webby award-winning and nominated songwriter, artist, director, producer, collector, party thrower.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Being born in Detroit influences everything I do. I never learned how to play an instrument, but Motown guided me to write songs that have sold over 50,000,000 records - like Earth Wind &amp; Fire's ""Boogie Wonderland,"" the musical <em>The Color Purple</em>, The Pointer Sisters ""Neutron Dance,"" and ""I'll Be There For You"" (the <em>Friends</em> theme), all known for their upbeat positivity. Spending every Saturday at my dad's scrapyard, just miles from the Big Three automakers, influenced my art, sets and graphic design. I also have a reputation as one of the best party throwers in the world, and for decades have prided myself on throwing kick-ass, large scale, musically-pumped social events.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHY I'M DOING THIS:</strong></div>
<div>Because I LOVE Detroit. One person's spirit can energize thousands. Music and creativity can transform a city. And the energy and success of a city can transform the world. Some hear nightmare stories about this town and may shake their heads in dismay. But time has shown that as Detroit goes, so goes the nation. Detroit is bubbling from the bottom up and ""The D"" celebrates the spirit that fuels the population as they pull together to build a bright future.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we film and record we will also generate revenue for the local economy, working with Detroit-based artists and local businesses. In addition, all profits go to two local crown artistic jewels, The Heidleberg Project and the Mosaic Youth Theatre. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT YOUR COIN COVERS:</strong></div>
<div>Pre-production expenses, travel, preliminary technical costs, location scouting, and research. I've already spent a lot my own money producing a demo and YouTube video of ""The D"" (which you can see on the “gallery” page here) so everyone can learn the song, as well as built a website and funded four trips to Detroit with my team laying groundwork.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHY IS SOMEONE LIKE ME ASKING YOU FOR MONEY:</strong></div>
<div>I've never asked for money before. People think I'm loaded, given that I've written so many hit songs, but I've been a self-funded artist for the past 20+ years, <em>rarely</em> funded by others. I've always used every dime I've made to constantly reinvent myself, much like Detroit is faced with doing now. I'm not asking this for myself, I'm asking it for <em>Detroit.</em> So please, pretty please, help me help the city that has kept the world rolling and bouncing to the beat all these years.</div>

<h3>Back Story</h3>
<p>Throughout my childhood, I've been singing. I sang in plays, skits, and choirs. When people would ask me what I wanted to be when i grew up, I always would reply, ""A Star"". I played my first show when I was 17 as a senior in high school. It was amazing, and I'll never forget that. I wanted to start recording so I got a loop station pedal and recorded my songs live onto that. It was very hard to do. After listening to the product of my recordings, I knew I needed something better so I bought the light version of Cubase SE and waited all night outside of Best Buy on Black Friday to get a discounted Toshiba laptop to record my music on. The quality was better than the loop station recordings but that isn't saying much. They still stunk.</p>
<p>One day I was watching Coyote Ugly, haha don't laugh at me, and in the movie the main actress was shopping for a laptop to record on and the sales person told her ""If you want to take yourself seriously as a musician, then you need a Mac"". Or something along those lines, but it hit me ""I need a Mac!"" So I went back to Best Buy and bought one on credit and had to make payments. I paid it off about a year later. I also found and bought a Snowball, Blu Mic on Craigslist to record with. I recorded an album using GarageBand and my recording were much better but not even close good quality. Did I mention I converted my closet into my recording booth? yea, it was a little tight..</p>
<p>I then figured I needed a better microphone and better pre-amp so as a gift on my 21st birthday, my parents bought me some Prosonus gear. A Prosonus mic and a Prosonus audio box, which isn't great but it's a heck of a lot better than the Snowball Mic. I recorded an album I called ""Journey To Empyrean"" with my new gear. The album is really great. I spent money on getting my songs copy written and putting the album on iTunes and other streaming sites. I even paid a bunch of money on having the album packaged up so I could sell them at shows and whatnot and it look professional. I am still really proud of that album.</p>
<p>About 4 months ago, my Mac laptop was stolen out of my car when I ran in quickly to a friends house. I can't even tell you how upset I was and still am. I lost my mac which was a major tool in becoming who I want to be. I also lost my external hard drive that had all the music I was working on, on it along with at least 100 songs I had written.</p>
<p>A little while after that I knew I needed another Mac, so I had to buy another one and am currently still making payments on it. My financial funds are always depleted and it puts major restraints on what I want to do. And now here I am, humbly asking people for money to help me achieve my dreams. Please help support me, I promise to make you all proud.</p>

<h3>About Arkansas Dogjaw and Our Goals</h3>
<p><em><strong>""One of my old bands ""Certifiable"" played a show with these guys some time back at ""Heartbreakers"" on the Landing. They blew my mind that night with their level of musicianship and technical ability! They are going to release their first album soon and tour the midwest. Here is a new promo. Check it out and spread the word! They are flying the ""integrity"" flag high in a world of stagnant music..."" </strong></em><strong>-Joe Rich - St. Louis, MO</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> ""Arkansas Dogjaw is an indie-progressive rock power trio from Urbana, Illinois. With hauntingly sweet guitar, aggressive bass, mouth-watering drumming, and powerful vocals, they bring a fresh sound and tangible groove. What makes this band unique and exciting is the diverse musical backgrounds of the members and the way that the genres are combined to create a new, big sound."" (from <a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/arkansasdogjaw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.reverbnation.com/arkansasdogjaw</a>)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self produce our first album</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tour for 25 days from December 21st, 2012 through January 7th, 2013 around the midwest</strong></li>
<li><strong>Long Term: Continue making albums, get radio play, build our fan base, and tour the rest of the country and abroad.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>A donation</strong> is not simply a donation to our band, but an investment in keeping the creative process in music alive.  Basically we are a band looking to bring something fresh to the musical table.  We are headed down the independent path so that we can remain free to explore music without being shoved into a box.  The drawback is that <em><strong>we don't have a large record company paying our way</strong></em> and promoting for us.  This makes <strong>YOU, </strong>the listener/supporter/contributor very influential in the course that this band takes.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We are not slackers looking to get rich and famous through music as a way out.  We are all college educated and want to make music our life because we have a love for creativity and innovation in music.</strong></p>

</div></div>","About Arkansas Dogjaw and Our Goals
""One of my old bands ""Certifiable"" played a show with these guys some time back at ""Heartbreakers"" on the Landing. They blew my mind that night with their level of musicianship and technical ability! They are going to release their first album soon and tour the midwest. Here is a new promo. Check it out and spread the word! They are flying the ""integrity"" flag high in a world of stagnant music..."" -Joe Rich - St. Louis, MO
Bio: ""Arkansas Dogjaw is an indie-progressive rock power trio from Urbana, Illinois. With hauntingly sweet guitar, aggressive bass, mouth-watering drumming, and powerful vocals, they bring a fresh sound and tangible groove. What makes this band unique and exciting is the diverse musical backgrounds of the members and the way that the genres are combined to create a new, big sound."" (from www.reverbnation.com/arkansasdogjaw)
 
Our goals:

Self produce our first album
Tour for 25 days from December 21st, 2012 through January 7th, 2013 around the midwest
Long Term: Continue making albums, get radio play, build our fan base, and tour the rest of the country and abroad.

 
A donation is not simply a donation to our band, but an investment in keeping the creative process in music alive.  Basically we are a band looking to bring something fresh to the musical table.  We are headed down the independent path so that we can remain free to explore music without being shoved into a box.  The drawback is that we don't have a large record company paying our way and promoting for us.  This makes YOU, the listener/supporter/contributor very influential in the course that this band takes.  
 
We are not slackers looking to get rich and famous through music as a way out.  We are all college educated and want to make music our life because we have a love for creativity and innovation in music.
 
 Let's get personal:

Grew up in Korea for 14 years, then studied in La Crosse, WI and South Bend, IN. Influences include: Bill Ward, Butch Trucks, Neil Peart, Sean Kinney, Danny Carey, Dave Grohl, Josh Freese, and any drummers regardless of their skill level. Currently studying at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with BAs in Environmental Science and Chemistry and currently working as a research assistant in on-campus materials research lab.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>I have been writing songs since I was in the 6th grade. I grew up in Memphis, TN, went to school in Jackson, MS, worked in the mountains of Colorado, then moved my family to the good, ole state of Texas. All of these rootsy places have shaped every note I play. </p>
<p>Even though I have been writing a long time, this will be my FIRST record with all original songs. As a musician, this is a big, scary step to take. I have been living this record for a year, and I'm plum tired of you not hearing it!</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Here's the skinny:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every penny goes to recording and reproducing this album. That's the simplest way to put it.</li>
<li>Not only do you get what, I think, are some great tunes, but along with the music come some great perks. Take a look on the right of your screen and you'll see what you have to choose from. </li>
<li>The closer I get to the goal, the more songs you hear. Music traditionally cost money per song, not per album, so I can't stress this enough: mo' money, mo' songs.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>You are here because you love my music or because someone you know sent you here. I have devoted my life to making music and I can only pray that it has (or will) impacted you. These songs are about cancer and sin and love and the way things used to be. They are a collection of what I've been thinking about over the past few years. This album is a testimony to who I am and who I want to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>I make music because I love it</li>
<li>I make music to make a difference</li>
<li>I make music for you</li>
<li>I make money to make music (not the other way around)</li>
</ul><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</li>
<li>If you live in the Houston area I can give you super neat materials to pass out at school, work, and local joints where the cool kids hang.</li>
<li>Social media is our best friend. I need EVERYONE to post this link on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and any other site you're apart of - (igg.me/at/tylernewberry). This is incredibly important.</li>
