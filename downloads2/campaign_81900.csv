<p>My name is Ranjani Krishnan. I am woman of Indian origin, who grew up in the middle-east and have spent the last 20 or so years in Portland, Oregon. I have been fortunate in my life to be able to absorb various genres of music in my journey through the world - Indian Classical, Flamenco, Balkan, North African, Jazz, Celtic, Country. The music I perform is a composite of all these genres and I want to be able to bring my music to life. </p>
<p>I am also a composer who is also trying to bring to fruition some rare ideas like putting together Renaissance polyphony with the idea of Raga in Indian music and creating harmonies in the context of Ragas. All these ideas need resources and people to bloom. I am a high school teacher by day with humble means. In order to recruit musicians to work with me on anything innovative, requires that I offer them the time and funds to work with me as they are also trying to make a living with their existing repertoire. New music requires us to participate in experiments, learn from them so that we can can produce a shining final product. And no, it won't stop with a product, this vision will continue.</p>

To us, just the fact that you've found your way here, means a great deal.</p><p>We are Philip Wikel and Peggy Johnson and we are publishers, musicians, photographers and writers on the island of Maui. Philip has had mild success as a musician with his band The Julian Day, he makes a living as a graphic designer and loves the Hawaiian Culture.</p><p>Peggy is a retired warrior and mother of three. Her background is in Law Enforcement, Gang mediation and intervention. She is also a Plant, animal, and human rights activist. She is an artist, a writer and is studying native American, Hawaiian, and Asian holistic medicine.</p><p>Philip Wikel is a five star (Midwest Book Review) novelist, a graphic designer and publisher who also dabbles in music and photography. He studied Comparative Literature at UC-Santa Cruz and his lifelong passion for words led him to write poetry, short stories, two novellas and journalistic pieces which have found readership in various forms of publication. He considers the high point of his writing career to be when he interviewed the musician Jack Johnson for Blue Edge magazine as it fused three of his favorite interests, music, surfing, and writing. After making 5 extended trips to surf on Maui, beginning in 1986, Phil finally decided to make the island his home in 2012. </p><p><b>His motto: ""Endeavoring to increase the moments of joy experienced through the arts.""</b></p><p>Philip and Peggy reside at the Ka Hale A Ke Ola Homeless Resource Center/Homeless Shelter and are very hopeful of moving forward and outward.</p><p><b>Our intention is to establish a communication and resource network.</b></p><p>The campaign actually has three interlocking components. Firstly the Video Fest (which will be a weekly online broadcast) and will showcase diverse bands from around the world with Hawaiian Culture and music as it's centerpiece thusly perpetuating the Spirit of Aloha and create a worldwide bond between socially and politically conscious bands from around the world. We will also be working with the ""Music is the Medicine"" Foundation. Musicians in the festival include representatives from Portugal, India, Germany, The Phillipines, the UK, and various and sundry other parts of the world, including Texas.</p><p>Secondly there is our fledgling publication Mauisalt Magazine, a quarterly publication which we hope to use as a vehicle to: </p><p>1. Promote Hawaiian Culture through its connection to the Ocean  </p><p>2. Promote the Video Fest and... </p><p>3. Serve as an outreach for the many native people who have found themselves homeless on Maui and the Other Hawaiian Islands.</p><p>And thirdly, to help establish a warrior sanctuary (hopefully to be named the Queen Kaahumanu Center, given permission). </p><p>We feel if we can't be part of the solution, then we are part of the problem. We've combined our gifts and visions to be activists for: Human Rights, The Land and The Sea, and The Hawaiian Culture which we honor and respect dearly. They our our hanai (adoptive) family.</p><p>We are working in collaboration with many non-profits on Maui, including the Homeless Alliance, Ka Hale A Ke Ola homeless resource center, and Maui School Garden Network. We need resources to assist us in helping these organizations through the success of the World Wide Video Fest and it's partner project Mauisalt Magazine. Together these things promote independent music and the music of Hawaii, a healthy ocean, artists in art and, in turn, promotes non-profits and other altruistic organizations that are beneficial to the islands and our planet as a whole as we will be featuring them both in the video fest and in the magazine.</p><p>Lastly, our greater goal is to eventually establish the aforementioned Kaahumanu Center, a place for education, healing, resources and a living facility for Hawaiians, veterans and others who suffer from PTSD and mental and emotional illnesses.</p><p>We've thus far garnered the support of Erin Fleming (CEO of Ka Hale A Ke Ola), Shelley Brown (Case Manager at Ka Hale A Ke Ola), Mike Zelko (Founder of See Farm) and Richard McDonald (US Department of Veteran Affairs).

To us, just the fact that you've found your way here, means a great deal.We are Philip Wikel and Peggy Johnson and we are publishers, musicians, photographers and writers on the island of Maui. Philip has had mild success as a musician with his band The Julian Day, he makes a living as a graphic designer and loves the Hawaiian Culture.Peggy is a retired warrior and mother of three. Her background is in Law Enforcement, Gang mediation and intervention. She is also a Plant, animal, and human rights activist. She is an artist, a writer and is studying native American, Hawaiian, and Asian holistic medicine.Philip Wikel is a five star (Midwest Book Review) novelist, a graphic designer and publisher who also dabbles in music and photography. He studied Comparative Literature at UC-Santa Cruz and his lifelong passion for words led him to write poetry, short stories, two novellas and journalistic pieces which have found readership in various forms of publication. He considers the high point of his writing career to be when he interviewed the musician Jack Johnson for Blue Edge magazine as it fused three of his favorite interests, music, surfing, and writing. After making 5 extended trips to surf on Maui, beginning in 1986, Phil finally decided to make the island his home in 2012. His motto: ""Endeavoring to increase the moments of joy experienced through the arts.""Philip and Peggy reside at the Ka Hale A Ke Ola Homeless Resource Center/Homeless Shelter and are very hopeful of moving forward and outward.Our intention is to establish a communication and resource network.The campaign actually has three interlocking components. Firstly the Video Fest (which will be a weekly online broadcast) and will showcase diverse bands from around the world with Hawaiian Culture and music as it's centerpiece thusly perpetuating the Spirit of Aloha and create a worldwide bond between socially and politically conscious bands from around the world. We will also be working with the ""Music is the Medicine"" Foundation. Musicians in the festival include representatives from Portugal, India, Germany, The Phillipines, the UK, and various and sundry other parts of the world, including Texas.Secondly there is our fledgling publication Mauisalt Magazine, a quarterly publication which we hope to use as a vehicle to: 1. Promote Hawaiian Culture through its connection to the Ocean  2. Promote the Video Fest and... 3. Serve as an outreach for the many native people who have found themselves homeless on Maui and the Other Hawaiian Islands.And thirdly, to help establish a warrior sanctuary (hopefully to be named the Queen Kaahumanu Center, given permission). We feel if we can't be part of the solution, then we are part of the problem. We've combined our gifts and visions to be activists for: Human Rights, The Land and The Sea, and The Hawaiian Culture which we honor and respect dearly. They our our hanai (adoptive) family.We are working in collaboration with many non-profits on Maui, including the Homeless Alliance, Ka Hale A Ke Ola homeless resource center, and Maui School Garden Network. We need resources to assist us in helping these organizations through the success of the World Wide Video Fest and it's partner project Mauisalt Magazine. Together these things promote independent music and the music of Hawaii, a healthy ocean, artists in art and, in turn, promotes non-profits and other altruistic organizations that are beneficial to the islands and our planet as a whole as we will be featuring them both in the video fest and in the magazine.Lastly, our greater goal is to eventually establish the aforementioned Kaahumanu Center, a place for education, healing, resources and a living facility for Hawaiians, veterans and others who suffer from PTSD and mental and emotional illnesses.We've thus far garnered the support of Erin Fleming (CEO of Ka Hale A Ke Ola), Shelley Brown (Case Manager at Ka Hale A Ke Ola), Mike Zelko (Founder of See Farm) and Richard McDonald (US Department of Veteran Affairs). These people have been truly inspiring and instrumental on getting us on the right track.What We Need & What You Get$250 per week for operating expenses over the course of six months until both the Video Fest and it's sister publication Mauisalt Magazine become established. (For a total of $6,000 dollars). This is essentially seed money and grants us enough time to: obtain advertising support, pay at least part of the expenses of a part-time advertising salesperson and to gain momentum and get established as a center for indie music, Hawaiian Culture, and publishing, and altruism in the community.$2,000 will go to printing the Premier Issue of Mauisalt Magazine (our main source of marketing for the Video Fest.$300 for a color printer.$500 for a professional camcorder for band interviews and special features, both for the Video Fest and the magazine website.$1,000 for rented or donated transportation for distribution of the magazine.$200 for hamburgers, fries, cokes and shoes.We're happy to provide receipts and post them for all expenditures.For a donation of $5.00 those with limited resources will receive a Mauisalt Magazine decal.For $10.00 donors will receive an Audio CD of the the first Aloha Maui ""Mixed Plate"" Video Fest and a Mauisalt Magazine decal.For a $25.00 donation donors will receive a DVD of the first Aloha Maui ""Mixed Plate"" Video Fest and a Mauisalt Magazine decal.For a $50.00 donation donors will receive an Audio CD and DVD of the the first Aloha Maui ""Mixed Plate"" Video Fest, and a Mauisalt Magazine decal.For a $100.00 donation donors will receive a Video Fest t-shirt, an Audio CD and DVD of the the first Aloha Maui ""Mixed Plate"" Video Fest, a Mauisalt Magazine decal.For a $250.00 donation donors will receive a profile in our magazine, a spot in the Video Fest and all of the merchandise described above.If we don't reach our goal we we will do our best with what we receive and hope for the best.The ImpactThe weekly Aloha Maui ""Mixed Plate"" Music Video Fest will showcase local hawaiian musicians, spread the word on the need to support, perpetuate and invigorate the Spirit of Aloha and Hawaiian Culture, and create a worldwide bond between bands from around the world.Mauisalt Magazine will, among other things, promote sustainable organic agriculture, speak to the ancient connection between land and sea from the Hawaiian perspective, and provide information about resources for the homeless, and work in any way possible toward alleviating the epidemic of homelessness.The Queen Kaahumanu Sanctuary will provide much needed healing, education, and other resources for veterans, displaced Hawaiians and others with PTSD and other mental illnesses.Why We Can Do ItPhilip has produced a national magazine (The Surfwriter's Quarterly) which performed better on the newsstand than nearly every other startup magazine carried by Warner International Periodicals.Philip also volunteered for the Surfrider Foundation which was successful in returning a major local beach to its natural state. He's worked for Habitat for Humanity and the Hawaiian Wildlife Fund on Maui.Peggy served on the Board of Directors for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Stanislaus County, California.

<p>In 2009, Matt Starling (formerly Matt Dixon) founded the Salt Lake Electric Ensemble, an electronic music performing group with acoustic touches. The group of 8 artists initially came together to perform American composer Terry Riley's classic 1964 minimalist composition In C, marking the first time the score had been approached primarily with electronic instruments. Under Starling's direction, the ensemble went on to turn heads in the contemporary art music community with the 2010 release of their recording of the piece, which earned critical praise throughout North America and Europe:</p>
<p><i>""[The Salt Lake Electric Ensemble's recording of In C] is nothing short of a revelation. . . . [It's] already the most important addition to the discography since the premiere recording, and will likewise be recognized as part of a performance tradition that is a vital and remarkably apt expression of the present cultural moment.""</i></p>

<p>Now, Starling seeks to publish another recording of a score by Riley.

<p>The piece has only been recorded with soprano saxophone performers up until this point. Starling, a brass instrumentalist since childhood, has now recorded the score using a flugelhorn. Its warm, captivating tone and its depth of sound when layered according to the instructions in the score has yielded a recording of the piece unlike any other. </p>
<p>While this particular piece had previously been approached mainly through live performance, Starling chose to produce the music over the course of several months in the recording studio. This allowed him to leverage several powerful music technologies including high resolution digital audio (24 Bits/96 KHZ), sophisticated computer audio editing, digital signal processing, and precision mixing tools. The result is pure hypnotic minimalism, with a pulsating and constantly evolving texture.</p>
<p>Matt Starling holds a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, and a Master of Music Technology degree from IUPUI in Indianapolis, IN. Commissioned performances with the Salt Lake Electric Ensemble have included the Utah Arts Festival, the University of Utah, Brigham Young University, IUPUI, Music at Main (Salt Lake City Public Library), and the Salt Lake Arts Council's Brown Bag Concert Series (2010-2013). He is also active as a music journalist, music educator, audio engineer, and composer. Watch for Starling's first ambient composition to be published in the summer of 2015.</p>

He is also active as a music journalist, music educator, audio engineer, and composer. Watch for Starling's first ambient composition to be published in the summer of 2015.
   Needs and Rewards  Your generous donation will allow Starling to manufacture CDs, secure international digital distribution, and will provide general operating support during the release of this project. All donations will grant the donor a copy of the album with album art included. If the funding goal is not met, Starling will make do with the funds available and deliver all perks on schedule. The album may be released on CD-R discs instead of professionally replicated CDs, depending on funding.    The Impact  There are only two existing recordings of this score, and neither explore instrumental timbres outside the saxophone family. Your donation will help build a recorded history of American music in the postwar period, and will allow the recording to be distributed worldwide.

<p>In March, after reading about how time isn't really linear, I got the idea to write a song about time and how we really only have the present moment.  I thought about how precious life is...and fragile...how it can change in the blink of an eye.  This song, <b>Kingdoms</b>, ended up touching on the <b>Boston Marathon</b> in a very poignant way.  </p>

<p>One of the songs, <b>""Rain Makes the Flowers Grow"",</b> was written in memory of <b>a child killed at Sandy Hook. </b>  Then in May, I found out Atlanta musician and activist, <b>Frank Barham,</b> had been killed in a traffic accident while on a  300 mile journey to Savannah by wheelchair.  This struck me very deeply...barely a week later I wrote the song ""<b>The Road to Savannah</b>"", which was inspired by Frank's journey and the deeper soul-searching mission he was on, to banish his own demons, and to help others.  </p>
<p>Just this past week (today is June 29th), I wrote a song, ""<b>Black Sun</b>"", to honor the victims who died at the <b>Emanual AME Church</b> in Charleston, SC.  Too often, the attention shifts away from the victims in these tragedies.  I want to bring the focus to them, and <b>how beautiful they were - their essence, their souls. </b></p>

<p>Welcome to my indiegogo campaign. I am Tru Advicate, a Christian Hip Hop Artist.  I am
trying to raise the money to properly record and promote a new album for Christ
to build God's kingdom.</p>
<p>In October 2014 I released a mixtape for people to download
free. The mixtape was well received but only went so far because of the lack
of funds to record it and promote it properly.</p>
<p>This album represents two things that is very important to me
and very important to what I believe are the needs of this world. I believe
that art as a whole is important to this world, specifically music.  I am a Christian man and I believe that people are loking for good, clean music that they can play with their children and families.  Music that is hot and music that makes you think.  Music with morals.  Music you can talk to your friends about. This is so important to me because music
is taken for granted. So, I want to take good music and use it spread the
gospel of Christ which tends to be either ignored or taken for granted.</p>
<p>Any artist will tell you that sometimes creating and distributing
your art properly can be very expensive. The need for money is often exploited
by those that feel they can profit from the art that the artists have created.
Some join a corporate structure that will dictate your creation to maximize the
potential of making money. Others will break the law or sell their art short to
obtain the money they need to properly do their art. A true artist is so
passionate about their art that they will do almost anything to be able to
express themselves through their art properly.</p>

people that will either enjoy my art, grow from my art, or feel good knowing that
someone else may be making positive changes in their lives as a result of Christ shining through my art. I am a hardworking musician who works 40 hours a week on my day job, drive a Honda, and support my wife and children.  I live a simple life and am </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">not asking for support of a lavish lifestyle or ideals.  By contributing to my campaign, you are contributing to help potentially save an

<p>Your contributions will go to studio time to record the album,
then getting the album properly mixed and mastered, making two professional
videos for two singles, strategic promotion for the videos of the two singles,
promoting the album, and getting the album distributed through online channels such as iTunes, Amazon, CD baby etc. etc.</p>
<p>We have some very exciting perks that I hope will excite you as
much as it excites me. I am really looking forward to Skype with donors
and getting a chance to thank you personally and to get any feedback or
anything that you may want to say to me.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will record the album and then mix and master it because nothing else matters if
I do not have an album to promote. Then I will adjust my marketing plan budget to maximize the remaining funds that I have available to me.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> riences <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>Let's be honest: Artists have put music in the hands of the large, major labels and the labels have released music that have been letting us down for
years. They are not concerned with making good music but only concerned with
making music that can push whatever product will make them the most money. </p>
<p>By
contributing to campaigns like mine, it gives you the power to say that you made
a contribution to good music getting out in the world at a time when the world
is starving for quality music. I truly believe that your contribution is a contribution to music that can offset the nonsense that is being popped into
the atmosphere today. </p>
<p>So many of our life experiences is tied to the memory of food, smells, and songs.  Why not tie your memories (and those of your children) to positive music for your soul instead of violent, profane, or stripper music?  Everyone comes for somewhere and I do not judge.  But shouldn't there be room made for the positive alternatives??? And shouldn't we support those artists keeping it clean?</p>
<p>Tru Advicate wants to bring music in this world that is hotter than hot, realer than real, and makes you ponder on life.  The impact of the music is changing minds, touching hearts, and enriching lives. </p>

time you step out to try to do something there are risks and hurdles involved. The
secret to my success in anything I have ever done was that I paid no attention
to risk or hurdles. I am able to do this because I try to always be led by
Christ.  I believe He will remove
any hurdles from my path so that now I don't even have to jump them or go
around them, I just walk right through.</p>

music, understand that every tool for Christ can be used to save souls and influence positive change. Look at
it this way: the brick layer may not like the plumber but they are both
necessary to building a house properly. That home can go on and become a refuge for

</div></div>","First off, THANK YOU, for stopping by! 


I will be available always to answer questions personally                                    
Email me at frankfishrub@gmail.com Subject “Ceph” and i will respond with a call if you wish or an email.
I am Frank “I.O.” Ferrante, I go by I.O. and I call myself an artist, but foremost I am a cosmic adventurer, trying to live to the fullest each day and create as many awesome things as the great Universe has for me to do! 
At the moment I have stepped into the most progressive ride in music and art and it is the internet! I am very active in the art community on Facebook, Patreon which is my office i suppose, and now on Soundcloud and on Bandcamp.  I basically am a “Busker”, a street performer sharing my world on the largest street in history!






“As I follow in the footsteps of the “ Godfathers” of this art form I am tempted, no, I am compelled to blaze new paths and find new adventure!” …I.O. 

This is the newest addition to this experience!

“I am using bits of the past and futuristic sounds to create a new experience and direction for music…”…i.o.


I love to create music, paintings, sculpture, film and more… I work often, with plastic 5 gallon water jugs as drums, a keyboard which is missing major notes, I work in a garage studio with no air conditioning so the paintings are often ruined by weather, and my art supplies are donated from neighbors and friends or found in refuse piles in good neighborhoods. I want to do more with my skills and it is often frustrating being limited by my tools. 


BUT, these setbacks or obstacles don’t stop my creations from coming to life. I just want to make bigger, better, and more epic art. 
I can do this with your support!
OK HERES THE CREATION!

“The Cephalopod”(basically a head with arms)

A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT CREATION OF MY OWN DESIGN! 

A percussive instrument composed of plastic water jugs and made to produce unique and strange music! 
The whole setup is similar to a guitarists rig and is accented by musically integrated lighting!

A show of light and music and sound to be experienced!This is proving to be a little pricy to get started but is doable and will be epic. I wish to take the idea out and perform and promote the ways we can help the planet out. Plastics are a literal plague, no pun intended. One liter to one gallon of water is used to make one shopping bag at the grocery and departments stores!  We are in a water crisis and over run with plastics from the Mariana Trench, to the highest mountain peaks, even in orbit!  So I try to inform folks when i can. 

This new creation would allow me to launch live performances via webcast and podcast and as well broadcast live performances from wherever I am, for free, to all of you!  I always strive to be forthright and open and I dream of creating  an awesome network of ART and friends and fans of progressive ideas! 
 With this new experience, I believe this will something worth tuning in for! 

I.O. stands for “I owe someone, something, somewhere.”This idea I have can be made smaller and personalized like a guitar and effects pedals and used on a plastic cup or a water jug!  And be made affordable so as  to be enjoyed by musicians and curious folks everywhere! 



My Latest Project is titled “The Earth Lives Within The Universe” composed and performed by me on a 5 gallon plastic water jug and edited in Final Cut Film Software so, it is very unconventional at the core.Please Enjoy!

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our trusty van of over a decade, Big Red, broke down in Kernersville, North Carolina in December 2013 and we haven't been able to replace her quite yet (not that anyone could ever <i>really</i> replace a van like Big Red...).</span></p>
<p><a href=""http://packwayhandleband.com/tour-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://packwayhandleband.com/tour-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Since the band is ready to hit the road for a 40+ date summer tour all over the United States from June until September</a>, we need your help more than ever to purchase a new van and get back on the road.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A vehicle big enough for a five-piece band heading out on tour isn't cheap, so we're looking to unload some merchandise and other great perks in order to offset the costs of a 15-passenger van that we'll take on our Summer 2015 tour and, hopefully, for years to come. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Here are just a few of the great perks we're offering to raise some money:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>CDs, show posters/banners (like the one shown below) signed by members of the band</li>
<li>Personalized cover songs recorded by the band</li>
<li>Private lessons for guitar, banjo and fiddle</li>
<li>Your name listed in the liner notes of the next Packway Handle Band album</li>
<li>Private performances regionally and around the US</li>
<li>And more!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>If you've stumbled onto this campaign page, we're assuming that you're at least somewhat familiar with Packway Handle Band. As you might know, we aren't exactly strangers to the road -- we've played hundreds of shows in nearly every corner of the United States over the past decade or so. We proudly put over 300,000 miles on Big Red before she finally gave out.   </p>
<p>For any successful band, reliable transportation is absolutely essential in keeping a tour running smoothly and that's no exception for Packway Handle Band. </p>
<p>Flying from town to town on the tour isn't remotely economically feasible and neither is driving in separate cars. </p>
<p><b>Since Packway Handle Band will be playing to roughly 15,000 people each night on their summer tour, we'll potentially be winning over a HALF MILLION new fans on the road during this tour. </b></p>
<p>You can play a crucial role in making sure that these crowds get to hear Packway Handle Band all summer long...</p>

</div><br/></div>","Help Fund the Packway Handle Band Van
 As you might be able to gather by now, the Packway Handle Band from Athens, Georgia is in need of a tour van. 
Our trusty van of over a decade, Big Red, broke down in Kernersville, North Carolina in December 2013 and we haven't been able to replace her quite yet (not that anyone could ever really replace a van like Big Red...).
Since the band is ready to hit the road for a 40+ date summer tour all over the United States from June until September, we need your help more than ever to purchase a new van and get back on the road.   What We Need & What You Get
A vehicle big enough for a five-piece band heading out on tour isn't cheap, so we're looking to unload some merchandise and other great perks in order to offset the costs of a 15-passenger van that we'll take on our Summer 2015 tour and, hopefully, for years to come. 
Here are just a few of the great perks we're offering to raise some money:


CDs, show posters/banners (like the one shown below) signed by members of the band
Personalized cover songs recorded by the band
Private lessons for guitar, banjo and fiddle
Your name listed in the liner notes of the next Packway Handle Band album
Private performances regionally and around the US
And more!

If we're lucky and we raise more than $25,000, additional funds raised on this campaign will go towards recording the band's new album, which will tentatively be recorded in late 2015.  




The Impact If you've stumbled onto this campaign page, we're assuming that you're at least somewhat familiar with Packway Handle Band. As you might know, we aren't exactly strangers to the road -- we've played hundreds of shows in nearly every corner of the United States over the past decade or so. We proudly put over 300,000 miles on Big Red before she finally gave out.   
For any successful band, reliable transportation is absolutely essential in keeping a tour running smoothly and that's no exception for Packway Handle Band. 
Flying from town to town on the tour isn't remotely economically feasible and neither is driving in separate cars. 
Since Packway Handle Band will be playing to roughly 15,000 people each night on their summer tour, we'll potentially be winning over a HALF MILLION new fans on the road during this tour. 
You can play a crucial role in making sure that these crowds get to hear Packway Handle Band all summer long...



    Risks & Challenges
We understand that you might be skeptical of throwing us your hard earned money, but remember that we're not looking for a handout. As we've already mentioned, you'll be getting something in return for your generosity. 
Many of the perks that we have listed are already in our possession (CDs, posters, etc.) -- it's just a matter of heading to the post office and mailing them to you.

If fulfilling a perk is not possible by the time their summer tour ends in September 2015, rest assured that you will be a priority when the band returns home from tour.

Other Ways You Can Help
 If you aren't able to contribute financially, you can still help this campaign tremendously by sharing the link to this page on your personal Facebook, Twitter and Instagram feeds or by posting in any online forums where you think people might be interested. 
Getting the word out is absolutely essential and we'd appreciate any help you can give us in spreading the campaign as widely as possible!
If you'd rather purchase music, we're also offering Name Your Own Price digital downloads over on the band's Bandcamp page during this campaign and throughout the summer tour.

<h3><strong>Hi! We are about to step into the studio to record a new album, and we need your help!</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The four of
us - who in musical collaboration call ourselves ‘Shore Thing’ - rooted on the
southern shores of Lake Ontario, gather to share in the friendship that our
song-sharing and rhythmic creations encourage. It is this close connection that
best represents our musical styling and live performance. Our embrace of
natural beauty and its gifts, as well as our treasured relationships with
friends, family and partners, generate the optimisms and humble energy that
give life to our sound. <br/></p>
<p>We have been creating with this inspiration for over a
year now, having released our first EP ‘Outside Voices’ in September 2014. With
much celebration and extraordinary support in response to our first production
and growing live performance, we want to take our creations and offerings to
the next level, as we tour and gig on a busy schedule throughout Spring and
Summer 2015 to raise funds for our upcoming musical investment. To help us
complete this project, we’re asking for your help in this two-way fundraising
opportunity that allows you to choose a product/service of ours in exchange for
your donation. Thank you for working on this with us together in inspiration
and support.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the perks please email us at - ben@shorethingtunes.com</p>

</p><h3>Where the Money Goes, and why should you donate?<br/>
</h3><p>For this new album, we have put together a world-class team of 
award-winning producers, 
and top-of-the-line audio engineers that will bring the absolute best 
out of our new songs. We also have a stellar creative team that’s 
designing the album art and packaging.<br/><br/>All of the fees add up 
very quickly, and after some number-crunching, we have calculated that 
everything will cost $13,100. Here is the breakdown:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Recording costs - $7,100<br/>
</li>
<li>Guest artists - $500<br/>
</li>
<li>Audio mastering - $1,000<br/>

</li>
<li>Indiegogo fees - $500</li>
</ul>The reason that we have not asked for you to pay the whole amount with us is we want to show you that we are serious about our musical careers and endeavors.  We want to fund a big portion of this album ourselves.  Unfortunately in the time constraints of wanting to release this full length album, we will not have the time or the resources to come up with the full $13,100 on our own.  That is where you come in!  We feel that asking for $5,000 will help us out a lot, but is a reasonable and attainable help.<br/><br/>We have all kinds of great perks to incentivize you to contribute. You 
are making this album possible, and you deserve to be rewarded! There 
are different tiers of giving: the more you give, the more you get! Some
 awesome perks include being us recording a cover song of your choice, having us at your house concert, and free attendance to ten Shore Thing concerts of your choice.<br/><br/>You
 can find more detailed information about contribution perks in the 
right-hand column on our IndieGoGo campaign page. Some of the incentives
 are limited, and first-come-first-serve, so please, contribute early 
and often.<br/><br/><h3><strong>But what does your music sound like?</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most exciting parts about making this new album is 
that—however cheesy this sounds—we feel like we’ve finally found our 
sound and artistic voice as a band. It lies somewhere in between indie, folk and soul, and it’s awesome. But don’t take our word for it...Help 
us make this album possible so you can see for yourself.<br/><br/>To get a

People who have attended our events in the past have frequently described them as life and attitude changing and in particular they create understanding, and a decrease in anger and fear of the other. </div><div><br/></div><div>We will be working with local partners in each area who are deeply engaged in building stronger communities where all people can flourish, and these concerts will create a safe space for deeper cultural exchange and engagement. They will contribute to the ongoing community bridge-building work which has been in process, developing  understanding and strong cross-cultural relationships over many years. The relationships thus created are pivotal for lasting peace and security to be achieved for all of us.

""MUSIC at the INTERSECTION"" : Two Concerts for Peace





We are global citizens (Armenian, English, Israeli, Palestinian) working and making music together through the UK based  charity ""Spirit of Peace"" which is committed to creating new pathways of dialogue, understanding and sustained positive action, bringing together people and communities who  don't usually meet.
If you'd like to know more about us, you can check us out at:
www.spiritofpeace.co.uk    www.lullabies-of-loss.org 
Click the following link to hear Hasmik in performance:
https://youtu.be/9ozY8LMwFAA


Coming soon in July there will be two concerts in Jerusalem and Nazareth  - a  hopeful sharing of  our rich musical heritages which exist alongside one another but  rarely intersect. We will not charge entrance to these concerts, because we  want them to be open for all communities to come together. 
We need your help!!






The ImpactWe are bringing together audiences, musicians and community leaders in the spirit of hope encouraging them to be proactive for cultural dialogue and to make space to hear each other's narrative. People who have attended our events in the past have frequently described them as life and attitude changing and in particular they create understanding, and a decrease in anger and fear of the other. We will be working with local partners in each area who are deeply engaged in building stronger communities where all people can flourish, and these concerts will create a safe space for deeper cultural exchange and engagement. They will contribute to the ongoing community bridge-building work which has been in process, developing  understanding and strong cross-cultural relationships over many years. The relationships thus created are pivotal for lasting peace and security to be achieved for all of us.

""Hope is the faith that, together we can make things better"" Rabbi Jonathan Sacks

It is particularly significant in this year which commemorates the Centennial of the Armenian Genocide. We hope it will create an awareness of the rich treasures of the Armenian Christian and folk heritage.


Refreshments will be served at the end giving the opportunity for people to meet each other and the performers and community leaders.

Risks & ChallengesWell, first of all, its going to be challenging and embarrassing if we don't have money to pay the musicians!!

Research shows that learning the do-re-mis can help children excel in ways beyond the basic ABCs.</p><p><strong>More Than Just Music</strong><br/>Research has found that learning music facilitates learning other subjects and enhances skills that children inevitably use in other areas. “A music-rich experience for children of singing, listening and moving is really bringing a very serious benefit to children as they progress into more formal learning,” says Mary Luehrisen, executive director of the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Foundation, a not-for-profit association that promotes the benefits of making music.</p><p>Making music involves more than the voice or fingers playing an instrument; a child learning about music has to tap into multiple skill sets, often simultaneously. For instance, people use their ears and eyes, as well as large and small muscles, says Kenneth Guilmartin, cofounder of Music Together, an early childhood music development program for infants through kindergarteners that involves parents or caregivers in the classes.</p><p>“Music learning supports all learning. Not that Mozart makes you smarter, but it’s a very integrating, stimulating pastime or activity,” Guilmartin says.</p><p><strong>Language Development</strong><br/>“When you look at children ages two to nine, one of the breakthroughs in that area is music’s benefit for language development, which is so important at that stage,” says Luehrisen. While children come into the world ready to decode sounds and words, music education helps enhance those natural abilities. “Growing up in a musically rich environment is often advantageous for children’s language development,” she says. But Luehrisen adds that those inborn capacities need to be “reinforced, practiced, celebrated,” which can be done at home or in a more formal music education setting.</p><p>According to the Children’s Music Workshop, the effect of music education on language development can be seen in the brain. “Recent studies have clearly indicated that musical training physically develops the part of the left side of the brain known to be involved with processing language, and can actually wire the brain’s circuits in specific ways. Linking familiar songs to new information can also help imprint information on young minds,” the group claims.</p><p>This relationship between music and language development is also socially advantageous to young children. “The development of language over time tends to enhance parts of the brain that help process music,” says Dr. Kyle Pruett, clinical professor of child psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine and a practicing musician. “Language competence is at the root of social competence. Musical experience strengthens the capacity to be verbally competent.”</p><p><strong>Increased IQ</strong><br/>A study by E. Glenn Schellenberg at the University of Toronto at Mississauga, as published in a 2004 issue of Psychological Science, found a small increase in the IQs of six-year-olds who were given weekly voice and piano lessons. Schellenberg provided nine months of piano and voice lessons to a dozen six-year-olds, drama lessons (to see if exposure to arts in general versus just music had an effect) to a second group of six-year-olds, and no lessons to a third group. The children’s IQs were tested before entering the first grade, then again before entering the second grade.</p><p>Surprisingly, the children who were given music lessons over the school year tested on average three IQ points higher than the other groups. The drama group didn’t have the same increase in IQ, but did experience increased social behavior benefits not seen in the music-only group.</p><p><strong>The Brain Works Harder</strong><br/>Research indicates the brain of a musician, even a young one, works differently than that of a nonmusician. “There’s some good neuroscience research that children involved in music have larger growth of neural activity than people not in music training. When you’re a musician and you’re playing an instrument, you have to be using more of your brain,” says Dr. Eric Rasmussen, chair of the Early Childhood Music Department at the Peabody Preparatory of The Johns Hopkins University, where he teaches a specialized music curriculum for children aged two months to nine years.</p><p>In fact, a study led by Ellen Winner, professor of psychology at Boston College, and Gottfried Schlaug, professor of neurology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, found changes in the brain images of children who underwent 15 months of weekly music instruction and practice. The students in the study who received music instruction had improved sound discrimination and fine motor tasks, and brain imaging showed changes to the networks in the brain associated with those abilities, according to the Dana Foundation, a private philanthropic organization that supports brain research.</p><p><strong>Spatial-Temporal Skills</strong><br/>Research has also found a causal link between music and spatial intelligence, which means that understanding music can help children visualize various elements that should go together, like they would do when solving a math problem.</p><p>“We have some pretty good data that music instruction does reliably improve spatial-temporal skills in children over time,” explains Pruett, who helped found the Performing Arts Medicine Association. These skills come into play in solving multistep problems one would encounter in architecture, engineering, math, art, gaming, and especially working with computers.</p><p><strong>Improved Test Scores</strong><br/>A study published in 2007 by Christopher Johnson, professor of music education and music therapy at the University of Kansas, revealed that students in elementary schools with superior music education programs scored around 22 percent higher in English and 20 percent higher in math scores on standardized tests, compared to schools with low-quality music programs, regardless of socioeconomic disparities among the schools or school districts. Johnson compares the concentration that music training requires to the focus needed to perform well on a standardized test.</p><p>Aside from test score results, Johnson’s study highlights the positive effects that a quality music education can have on a young child’s success. Luehrisen explains this psychological phenomenon in two sentences: “Schools that have rigorous programs and high-quality music and arts teachers probably have high-quality teachers in other areas. If you have an environment where there are a lot of people doing creative, smart, great things, joyful things, even people who aren’t doing that have a tendency to go up and do better.”</p><p>And it doesn’t end there: along with better performance results on concentration-based tasks, music training can help with basic memory recall. “Formal training in music is also associated with other cognitive strengths such as verbal recall proficiency,” Pruett says. “People who have had formal musical training tend to be pretty good at remembering verbal information stored in memory.”</p><p><strong>Being Musical</strong><br/>Music can improve your child’ abilities in learning and other nonmusic tasks, but it’s important to understand that music does not make one smarter. As Pruett explains, the many intrinsic benefits to music education include being disciplined, learning a skill, being part of the music world, managing performance, being part of something you can be proud of, and even struggling with a less than perfect teacher.</p><p>“It’s important not to oversell how smart music can make you,” Pruett says. “Music makes your kid interesting and happy, and smart will come later. It enriches his or her appetite for things that bring you pleasure and for the friends you meet.”<br/>While parents may hope that enrolling their child in a music program will make her a better student, the primary reasons to provide your child with a musical education should be to help them become more musical, to appreciate all aspects of music, and to respect the process of learning an instrument or learning to sing, which is valuable on its own merit.</p><p>“There is a massive benefit from being musical that we don’t understand, but it’s individual. Music is for music’s sake,” Rasmussen says. “The benefit of music education for me is about being musical. It gives you have a better understanding of yourself. The horizons are higher when you are involved in music,” he adds. “Your understanding of art and the world, and how you can think and express yourself, are enhanced.”</p><br/></div>","So Why Did a High School Student Start This Program?

JamShalom is a grassroots chill-scene that brings spiritual connection to jamband events and festivals across
North America. Run by a dedicated team of volunteers, you've probably seen the JamShalom or PHISHalom tent at many a show, offering a shady place to hang out, eat and drink, throw down amazing Shabbat
meals, enjoy musical prayer services, and have lots of meaningful conversations!  :-)
Last Year
Last
year, the JamShalom crew was on the road for over 555 hours, hitting most of PHISH tour, and also Lock'n.  Over
2,500 Holy Chillers came through our tents, enjoying the free soda, water and beer, along with all kinds of grilled goodies and the great company of old and newfound friends.
Wanna Join Us??Because JamShalom is all about new faces and friends, we thought we'd do something cool and different!  Why not combine a fundraiser for this summer's tour with inviting our friends and supporters to join us in the vibes and dancing??  So please, contribute to our campaign - as we NEED YOUR SUPPORT  to do this summer's tour!!  And then we hope that you will be one of the 10 people chosen to join our team in Chicago at Grateful Dead lot, which includes a free ticket to one night's show!!
Our Summer Plans
This year, we plan to
make JamShalom bigger and more raging than ever! Starting our summer tour with the 50thAnniversary Grateful Dead
Shows in Chicago on July 4thweekend, and once again ending with Lockn Music Festival in
Arlington, Virginia, we have a JAM-packed summer schedule hitting up all your
favorite festivals.
But making this summer

<h4>Laeela</h4>
<p><span>Wir sind ""Laeela"" - Katrin Neelam und David Mages. Vor zwölf Jahren haben wir uns Mantra singend auf einem Rainbow Gathering kennengelernt. Seitdem ist das Singen von Mantras, Bhajans und Kirtans ein Herzstück unseres gemeinsamen Weges. Schon lange teilen wir diese Liebe in Singkreisen, Konzerten und Gatherings. Seit Katrin's Ausbildung zur Kundalini Yoga Lehrerin, sprudeln eigene Melodien und auch englische Texte aus uns raus. Die Zeit des Aufnehmens war sehr herausfordernd für uns aber das Ziel in unserem Herzen hat uns über alle Hürden geholfen. So dass wir in diesem Prozess letztlich in die totale Leichtigkeit und unbändige Freude an uns, diesem wundervollen Leben und schliesslich auch unserer Musik ankommen durften - what a blessing. Möge diese Musik noch mehr Licht, Liebe, Mut, Gelassenheit und Freude auf diese Welt bringen !!! </span></p>
<h4><span>Über dieses Album</span></h4>
<p><span>Die Mantras, die wir hier vertont haben, sind kraftvolle Instrumente, die uns helfen uns an genau die Kraft anzubinden, die wir brauchen für bestimmte Situationen, Probleme, Lebensphasen etc. und sie erinnern uns immer wieder ohne Umweg an unser spirituelles zu Hause. Umso schöner ist es nun diese Wunderwerke mit unseren Klängen zu vereinen. David hat sein begnadetes Talent als Multiinstrumentalist in all diese Stücke sehr intuitiv einfliessen lassen und produzierte das Album voller Hingabe, so dass wundervolle Arrangements, Stimmungen und Instrumentierungen ganz aus einem Fluss natürlich entstanden. Die meisten Stücke ruhig meditativ - einige auch mit brazilian vibes - immer wieder pure Freude das Album von vorne bis hinten durchzuhören. Hol Dir einen Vorgeschmack indem Du in die Vorschau unseres Albums reinhörst.</span></p>
<h4><i><b>Laeela</b></i></h4>
<p><span><i>We are Laeela - Katrin Neelam and David Mages. When we met twelve years ago on a rainbow gathering we both had already fallen in love with mantra singing. Ever since mantra, bhajan and kirtan singing has been an essential part of our way. For many years we've been sharing that love in chantingcircles, concerts and on spiritual events. The creative flow of our own Mantra compositions and lyrics began when Katrin started to deepen her yoga practice through the kundalini yoga teacher training. The time of recording has been quite a challenge for us but the fire in our heart helped us through every block. So that we finally reached a state of ease and pure joy about ourselves, this wonderful life and our music - what a blessing!

This album sees One Machine at our very best so far, and also features new members Chris Hawkins on Vocals and Stefano Selvatico on Bass alongside drummer Michele Sanna and founding members and guitarists Steve Smyth and Jamie Hunt. We need to raise funds to recoup some of our production costs, but most importantly we need your help to back this record with a proper promotional campaign and put money towards touring, so we can get out and play for all of you across the world!<br/>
</h3><br/><p>Recording The Final Cull saw us travel 1600 miles (round trip) to Death Island Studios in Denmark to work with engineer Marco Angioni, and Producer/Mixer/Co-Engineer Tue Madsen and lay down our best music yet. In a gruelling but immensely rewarding and successful 9 days of solid recording, we were pulling on average 15-18hr days, and drank about 15-18 litres of coffee (""Fresh Pots!"")...each...per day. This wasn’t just some masochistic rite of passage however, we were hell bent on the goal of giving you the best live - that’s right, LIVE! - Heavy Metal studio record we could, regardless of time and budget constraints.</p><p></p><h3>What We Need...</h3><p>We have set our target to £5000 because this will cover the most important costs involved in taking the next steps - the remaining production costs (final mixes and masters), PR campaign, and tour support. However, realistically, all in, we are looking at something like £10,000 to really cover everything, so every pound we raise above our initial target will go straight into making The Final Cull as big, bad and brave as we always envisaged. </p><p>Tour Support - This includes travel costs, accommodation expenses, everything that goes into making a tour happen. Of course, it’s no secret that buy-ons are now a standard in the industry, and setting aside some of our budget to this will mean we can come see you guys on some fantastic package tours with incredible bands, so you can come see us at some great shows with great line-ups. </p><p>We’ve fronted as much of this budget as we possibly can, but we now need your help to get this album and this music out to the world, both in promoting the album in the press and online, but in performing it directly for metalheads and music lovers the world over. This album was recorded LIVE, because it was meant to be heard LIVE!<br/><br/></p><h3>...What You Get</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stevesmyth.com/cd3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

Of course, you can get hold of the album in various formats - Digital Download, Digipak CD, Special Edition Vinyl - but we'll also be offering limited edition T-Shirts and other merch and exclusive experiences with the band, from Backstage Passes to Music Lessons. We've even got some quality instruments available. Alongside that, EVERYONE who contributes towards this project will get exclusive access to behind the scenes footage and interviews before anybody else, along with contributor-only updates and thank yous from the band.</p><h3>The Impact - What's so special about a 'live' studio album, anyway?</h3><p>We feel that many, many of the great records of history are the ones that were recorded in an organic, live studio environment. By this, we mean that the main core of the music - the drums, the guitars and the bass - were recorded together, at the same time, with members sharing the same room and the same space whilst hammering out the kind of high-intensity performances that you just don’t get from recording separate parts in separate locations. <br/></p><p>It’s become the standard now to lay down each instrument separately, to a click track, one at a time, in a way that strips away much of the humanity and depth that can only be created when the band members are performing together. There are good reasons for this, of course. One is time, ease and convenience, as musicians can fit recording around their other commitments by recording at home or at small project studios. The other is money. Sadly, very few artists and very few labels ever see the kind of budgets that made those classic records so great. The kind of budget where a band could write, record and even live together in a studio for the weeks or months that it took to make great music. <br/></p><p>We want to prove, by example, that with the right planning and the right people, and with help from the fans, bands CAN still make amazing live studio records on modest budgets. Not only did we record this album together, live together, eat together and sleep together (ahem) for the full 9 days (even WITH Chris’s ass stanking up the place), we even WROTE much of the material whilst we were there! That's right, a good chunk of these songs actually came together as the band were jamming in the studio.

This album sees One Machine at our very best so far, and also features new members Chris Hawkins on Vocals and Stefano Selvatico on Bass alongside drummer Michele Sanna and founding members and guitarists Steve Smyth and Jamie Hunt. We need to raise funds to recoup some of our production costs, but most importantly we need your help to back this record with a proper promotional campaign and put money towards touring, so we can get out and play for all of you across the world!
Recording The Final Cull saw us travel 1600 miles (round trip) to Death Island Studios in Denmark to work with engineer Marco Angioni, and Producer/Mixer/Co-Engineer Tue Madsen and lay down our best music yet. In a gruelling but immensely rewarding and successful 9 days of solid recording, we were pulling on average 15-18hr days, and drank about 15-18 litres of coffee (""Fresh Pots!"")...each...per day. This wasn’t just some masochistic rite of passage however, we were hell bent on the goal of giving you the best live - that’s right, LIVE! - Heavy Metal studio record we could, regardless of time and budget constraints.What We Need...We have set our target to £5000 because this will cover the most important costs involved in taking the next steps - the remaining production costs (final mixes and masters), PR campaign, and tour support. However, realistically, all in, we are looking at something like £10,000 to really cover everything, so every pound we raise above our initial target will go straight into making The Final Cull as big, bad and brave as we always envisaged. Tour Support - This includes travel costs, accommodation expenses, everything that goes into making a tour happen. Of course, it’s no secret that buy-ons are now a standard in the industry, and setting aside some of our budget to this will mean we can come see you guys on some fantastic package tours with incredible bands, so you can come see us at some great shows with great line-ups. We’ve fronted as much of this budget as we possibly can, but we now need your help to get this album and this music out to the world, both in promoting the album in the press and online, but in performing it directly for metalheads and music lovers the world over. This album was recorded LIVE, because it was meant to be heard LIVE!...What You Get


Contribute today and upgrade later! Indiegogo makes it very easy to upgrade your choice as new perks become available. See this page for more info.
We're in the works with lining up some fantastic perks (hey, that rhymed!) for everyone who backs this project. Of course, you can get hold of the album in various formats - Digital Download, Digipak CD, Special Edition Vinyl - but we'll also be offering limited edition T-Shirts and other merch and exclusive experiences with the band, from Backstage Passes to Music Lessons. We've even got some quality instruments available. Alongside that, EVERYONE who contributes towards this project will get exclusive access to behind the scenes footage and interviews before anybody else, along with contributor-only updates and thank yous from the band.The Impact - What's so special about a 'live' studio album, anyway?We feel that many, many of the great records of history are the ones that were recorded in an organic, live studio environment. By this, we mean that the main core of the music - the drums, the guitars and the bass - were recorded together, at the same time, with members sharing the same room and the same space whilst hammering out the kind of high-intensity performances that you just don’t get from recording separate parts in separate locations. It’s become the standard now to lay down each instrument separately, to a click track, one at a time, in a way that strips away much of the humanity and depth that can only be created when the band members are performing together. There are good reasons for this, of course. One is time, ease and convenience, as musicians can fit recording around their other commitments by recording at home or at small project studios. The other is money. Sadly, very few artists and very few labels ever see the kind of budgets that made those classic records so great. The kind of budget where a band could write, record and even live together in a studio for the weeks or months that it took to make great music. We want to prove, by example, that with the right planning and the right people, and with help from the fans, bands CAN still make amazing live studio records on modest budgets. Not only did we record this album together, live together, eat together and sleep together (ahem) for the full 9 days (even WITH Chris’s ass stanking up the place), we even WROTE much of the material whilst we were there! That's right, a good chunk of these songs actually came together as the band were jamming in the studio. You don't get much more FRESH and ORGANIC than that beyond the whole foods aisle at Waitrose. Other Ways You Can HelpOf course, not everyone can contribute but there are so many ways you can help:

<p></p>
<b></b><p><b>Hello again!</b></p>
<p>Welcome to the pre-sale campaign for my first fully-produced studio effort, <b>Break Me Down</b>. The material for this record has been written over the last 3 years, and the album itself has been in the works for about a year and a half. I'm thrilled to report that we are entering the home stretch, and after months of hard work, a few setbacks, and a whole lot of support, I can't wait to share the final product with all of you.</p>
<p><b>Let's recap...</b><br/></p>
<p>Back in May, I launched an <a href=""http://igg.met/at/jolinebaylis"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">indiegogo campaign</a> to help fund the making of the album. So many wonderful people jumped on board in support, and in the end I raised over $7000 towards my goal. To all of you who contributed to the campaign, all I can say is THANK YOU! Your donations allowed me record the bulk of the album over the five days we spent at <b>Afterlife Studios</b>, and the results have far exceeded my expectations going into this project.</p>
<p>Summer put us in a bit of a holding pattern for production. We needed to schedule a couple more days in the studio to finish up vocals and explore ideas for extra touches to flesh out the album's sound. Festival season and summer tours saw the team scattering throughout the province, across the country, and all over the United States. I mostly stayed in Vancouver, busking heavily on the beaches to raise what was needed to complete the record. I'm happy to say that we have just completed another 3-day session in the studio to finish tracking, and we have welcomed to the team <b>Tyson Naylor</b> (Dan Mangan and Blacksmith, Tyson Naylor Trio) on piano and organ.</p>
<p><b>Pre-Sale Campaign</b><br/></p>
<p>Since the completion of the first campaign, I've gotten a lot 
of great feedback and questions. A number of people commented that the 
deadline came and went too quickly, and asked if there was still a way 
to pre-order a copy of the album. A lot of the new folks I've met 
while busking have shown interest as well, saying they would like to 
pre-order if they could. In response to this feedback, and to help cover
 the last remaining costs of production (such as mastering, artwork and pressing), I have decided to use indiegogo again as a platform to set up a pre-sale option for the album.</p>
<p><b>Extras</b><br/></p>
<p>Just for fun I've included some of the ""perks"" from the original campaign. If you'd like to be a part of the release of the album, you can pre-purchase 2 tickets to the release show along with your CD, or you can attend a private listening party with me, my friends, and some of the musicians who worked on the album. You can also choose from one of 3 signed art prints from Lauren Carr, who will be doing the artwork for the record. Or, if you really want to get personal, you can have me perform a private house show for you and your friends. You can find out more about these extras in the ""Perks"" section. By pre-ordering a digital download or signed CD, or choosing one of these extras, you're helping me in a big way to get the last of the work completed and get this album out into the world!<br/></p>

<p>Joline
 Baylis is a Vancouver-based singer-songwriter, poised to take her music
 far beyond the city that has shaped her. With a voice reminiscent of 
Eva Cassidy and Ani Difranco, her original material is fresh, haunting, 
and deeply personal. Her lyrics explore the depths and complexities of 
her experience with honesty and vulnerability, inviting listeners to 
encounter and connect with their own emotions.</p>
<b>
</b><p>In the three years since Joline has been performing in Vancouver, she
 has crafted an intimate and powerful solo show. She has played in local
 venues such as Cafe Deux Soleils, The Railway Club and The Backstage 
Lounge, as well as festivals around BC, including Arts Wells and Harmony
 Arts Festival. Touring throughout BC and Alberta, she has performed at 
such venues as Nancy O's in Prince George, The Bear's Paw Cafe in 
Wells, Owl Acoustic in Lethbridge and Ellison's Market in Nelson, where 
she was featured in an interview on CJLY 93.5 FM.
</p>
<p>She has also built a loyal following by busking extensively for 
the past two years, in beautiful and scenic locations throughout 
Vancouver. Joline brings her captivating live show to the unsuspecting 
masses by approaching busking as another chance to deliver a powerful 
performance, striving to create intimacy in an unlikely setting.</p>
<p>
Now, Joline is taking her soulfully written songs to new depths and new 
heights, by welcoming Kenton Loewen on drums (Dan Mangan and Blacksmith,
 The Crackling), Wynston Minckler on bass (Bocephus King) and Paul Pigat
 on electric guitar (Cousin Harley, Neko Case). The band has played 
together at The China Cloud and The Media Club, and are currently 
starting production on Joline’s first full-length album, due out in March 2016.</p>

Since the release of my first solo endeavor <i>Rustic Poet</i> in the Spring of 2011 I've continued birthing stories in the form of song. I'm now at the midpoint of working on my next album <i>Gravelhorse. </i>This will be an independent release which I
 am working on in my home studio. Not having a record label provides the
 advantage of creative freedom. On the other side of the coin I have no 
financial backing that having a record label provides.  <br/><br/>As I'm sure you can imagine there are many working parts that go into being able to have a successful record launch. With this true grassroots effort it's lots of in house production of everything from the artwork on the hand stamped CD covers to the handmade leather-works therefore incurring much less overhead cost and I am very thankful for the many hands that are in this project and what they do for the love of the song. That being said there are still many costs associated with with the production side of creating an outlet for those songs. I work outside all year long to support my family as well as my music endeavors and we are able to make ends meet week to week but to be frank, it's hard to pull the trigger on expenses to further the music while we have kids in school that have needs to be met as well. If it comes to either creating physical merchandise or putting crumbs on the table... I'm sure you understand what decisions have to be made. <br/><br/>This friends, is 
where you come in... I've created this pre-order campaign 
to help provide an opportunity for your support which will actually make you an executive producer, which will be noted for all time in the liner notes on this 
album. I'm not shooting for the moon folks and your investment does not come without reward. With your help for the first time ever there will be merchandise to support this CD's launch.<br/><br/>++ There will be some exclusive perks only available through this pre-order campaign.  There are a few different options to choose from so take a look 
and see what might tickle your fancy.<br/><div>

We work with youth all the time we provide lessons and services the average youth would not even know where to begin with.

We work with youth all the time we provide lessons and services the average youth would not even know where to begin with. Specifically though, in the past year I've seen a lot of musicians grow and create art & emotions in our school, and I've seen about 90% of those musicians looking to record. Unfortunately though when we explain how much it costs locally a bunch of our students lose hope and give up on recording or we have parents that can barely pay the bills let alone pay $600-4000+ to record a music album especially when they don't know the impact of music as a musician. Its our food we eat sleep, and breath it. We want to change that and YOU can make it happen.We have a room cleared out and ready to go, we have a layout and are doing what we can to raise funds to provide not just this but a lot more awesome opportunities for youth in the area.Such as seasonal compilations of local music to fund a local artist getting 100 free custom designed CD's because sometimes all it takes is those first 100.If the studio is running we can provide those 100 CD's and a free recording session!Even if your not local this is something that will inspire and help create opportunities for those that work so hard for it, and just can't cover it.    What We Need & What You Get Why do we need $3000?Believe it or not $3000 may seem like a lot, don't get me wrong it is!But when you break it down a new Stage quality drum set is going to run you around 1500, a new Gibson Les Paul is going to run you 2000+When it comes to renovating, new gear, mics and much more 3000$ isn't asking much but its enough with what we've raised to make this happen.What do you get as a contributor?Our five top contributors will be given a free recording session at our in house studio, you can use it yourself, donate it to one of our in-house student bands or that local band that can't cover the funds to record, its your way to personally give back in the meantime and long run by helping fund a studio to stay.What happens If we surpass $3000:For every $500 past our goal mark we will personally record a local artist in need and provide them with 1000 Digital Download Cards to spread there music everywhere.For every 1000$ past our goal mark we will personally provide a youth in six months of complimentary lessons at RFMS as well as an Acoustic or Electric Guitar!

<p>Hey! My name is Josh and I live in Santander,
Spain. I serve at a discipleship school (<a href=""http://la-industria.org/english.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La Industria</a>), I’m a worship leader
and huge Liverpool FC fan! I’ve been leading worship for years in the states
and also in Spain with a group of friends (<a href=""http://proyectoen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Proyecto EN</a>). We released a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7ykuY6zhP8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">worship album</a> of 11 original songs more than 2 years ago to give for free to churches
in Spain and other countries. It was amazing to see where God took it all!</p>
<p>A couple years ago I began a singer/songwriter
project. I wanted to share my story in a way that I wasn’t used to at all. I
released <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/josh-brister/id518916907"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2 albums</a> and I had so much fun with those experiences. Even tough I
really enjoyed that time of my life, I see clearly that my heart is with
worship music and it’s a fundamental part of my calling.</p>
<p>So I want to invite you to be apart of
something bigger than just a record. With this project you’re going to play
apart in my calling in Spain. I hope that it’ll be a blessing to churches and
that this CD will be a tool for revival!</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Why do I want to record a worship album?</b></h3>
<p>I don’t pretend to have the most talent or to be the best musician, but I am available for God to move through the people apart of this project. The truth is that I had tons of excuses that held me back for years (I’m a foreigner, I’ve got a strong accent, a lot of times I can’t say the double “r” correctly, etc…) but I want to be a man without fear, that desires to bring the kingdom of heaven here in Spain through worship music.</p>
<p>I’ve lived unbelievable experiences when Spaniards sing songs written in their own language and in their own country. They’ve got a special power and I want to contribute more songs like that.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Where's the money going? </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Something I feel very strongly from God is
that I should make this record in Spain. I want to bless Spaniards with this
record and also the incredible group of creatives that I have here. They’re
going to help me make this project happen. I believe in Spaniards and I know
that God wants to do lots through this precious country’s people! These are the
areas that we need to cover to make this recording happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Producer,
     studio engineer, mixing engineer (all Spaniards!)</li>
<li>Musicians
     (there’s lot of talent in Spain!)</li>
<li>Trips
     between Madrid, Burgos and Santander</li>
<li>Food
     for the rehearsal and recording days</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<b><b><h3> Challenges </h3></b></b><p><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Seeing
     as we live in different places, there’s little time to rehearse and
     worship together. We need God to join us together in a supernatural way.</li>
<li>The
     goal is to create a pure worship album. We need to maintain that vision
     and being creatives, it’s easy to steer off that path with so many ideas. </li>
</ul>
<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b><b>Other ways to support</b></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Prayer:
     Although I strongly believe in musical excellence, my priority is to focus
     on the spiritual side. You can pray that the Holy Spirit wrecks us throughout the process!</li>
<li>Please
     help us out by sharing this project with your friends on Facebook, Twitter
     and email!</li>

Tienen una fuerza especial y quiero aportar más canciones así.   ¿Donde va el dinero?  Algo que siento muy fuerte de Dios es que debo hacer este disco en España. Quiero bendecir a los españoles con este álbum y también al increíble grupo de gente tan creativa que tengo aquí. Ellos me van a ayudar a sacar este proyecto. ¡Creo en los españoles y se que Dios quiere hacer muchas cosas a través de la gente de este precioso país! Estas son las áreas que necesitamos cubrir para llevar a cabo la grabación:  Productor, técnico del estudio y técnico de mezcla (todos españoles)!
Los músicos (hay mucho talento en España!)
Viajes entre Madrid, Burgos y Santander
La comida de los días de ensayo y grabación

  Retos  Como vivimos en lugares diferentes, habrá poco tiempo para ensayar y alabar juntos. Necesitamos  que Dios nos junte de una manera sobrenatural.  La meta es crear un disco de alabanza puro y duro. Tenemos que mantener esa visión porque como somos gente creativa, es fácil que nos desviemos de la meta con tantas ideas.     Otras maneras de colaborar   Oración: Aunque creo firmemente en la excelencia musical, mi prioridad es darle un buen enfoque a la parte espiritual. Puedes orar para que el Espíritu Santo nos invada en cada momento.

English 

Hey! My name is Josh and I live in Santander,
Spain. I serve at a discipleship school (La Industria), I’m a worship leader
and huge Liverpool FC fan! I’ve been leading worship for years in the states
and also in Spain with a group of friends (Proyecto EN). We released a worship album of 11 original songs more than 2 years ago to give for free to churches
in Spain and other countries. It was amazing to see where God took it all!
A couple years ago I began a singer/songwriter
project. I wanted to share my story in a way that I wasn’t used to at all. I
released 2 albums and I had so much fun with those experiences. Even tough I
really enjoyed that time of my life, I see clearly that my heart is with
worship music and it’s a fundamental part of my calling.
So I want to invite you to be apart of
something bigger than just a record. With this project you’re going to play
apart in my calling in Spain. I hope that it’ll be a blessing to churches and
that this CD will be a tool for revival!

Why do I want to record a worship album?
I don’t pretend to have the most talent or to be the best musician, but I am available for God to move through the people apart of this project. The truth is that I had tons of excuses that held me back for years (I’m a foreigner, I’ve got a strong accent, a lot of times I can’t say the double “r” correctly, etc…) but I want to be a man without fear, that desires to bring the kingdom of heaven here in Spain through worship music.
I’ve lived unbelievable experiences when Spaniards sing songs written in their own language and in their own country. They’ve got a special power and I want to contribute more songs like that.

Where's the money going? 

Something I feel very strongly from God is
that I should make this record in Spain. I want to bless Spaniards with this
record and also the incredible group of creatives that I have here. They’re
going to help me make this project happen. I believe in Spaniards and I know
that God wants to do lots through this precious country’s people! These are the
areas that we need to cover to make this recording happen:

Producer,
     studio engineer, mixing engineer (all Spaniards!)
Musicians
     (there’s lot of talent in Spain!)
Trips
     between Madrid, Burgos and Santander
Food
     for the rehearsal and recording days


 Challenges 

Seeing
     as we live in different places, there’s little time to rehearse and
     worship together. We need God to join us together in a supernatural way.
The
     goal is to create a pure worship album. We need to maintain that vision
     and being creatives, it’s easy to steer off that path with so many ideas. 


Other ways to support


Prayer:
     Although I strongly believe in musical excellence, my priority is to focus
     on the spiritual side. You can pray that the Holy Spirit wrecks us throughout the process!

I've been singing for as long as I can remember and have come to understand that sharing messages, encouragement and sometimes education through MUSIC is not only what I am good at - it's what I am called and purposed to do. I am SUPER excited to start the journey of creating my very first SOLO project and would love to bring you along! My goal, through my music, is to encourage those that are discouraged, lift those that are low in spirit, empower those that feel like they are burned out and edify others through my personal experiences!  So I want to THANK YOU in advance for sewing into helping others! <br/><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3><h3>My Project</h3>
<p>I am launching this campaign to cover the costs of the CREATIVE process of making an album. You may or may not know this - but it is EXTREMELY costly to produce an album with more than 5 songs PROFESSIONALLY! Ofcourse you can go into someone's basement and click around on a few keyboards and go into someone's closet and record vocals, BUT when you try to produce that, the unprofessional-ism with shine through. And I don't want that. Would you want to listen to something produced LESS than what is considered standard quality? </p>
<p>So...I decided to take a shot at a crowdfunding campaign to allow YOU an opportunity to sew into the process and level of quality that I am seeking. The music you hear in the background of the video above is from Paul Richard. He is one of my VERY best friends and will be Producing this album with me. We currently have 10 songs on wax (that simply means we have done basic vocals and piano tracks to get the ideas of the songs down digitally). Now we need help getting to the next phase - which is actual production! </p>
<p><br/></p>What We Need  <p>Here is a list of what we need in order to get a completed album:</p>
<p>1. Pre-production fees </p>
<p>2. Studio time for recording, mixing, and mastering <br/>(This includes the live musicians needed to record, the live background singers to record, the engineers that are needed to record and additional producers needed to oversee the recording process)</p>
<p>3. Album Release Concert<br/>(This includes the venue, the band, the singers, the lite bites, the photographer and videographer)</p>
<p>4. CD Pressing &amp; Promotion <br/>(This includes the actual production of physical CD's and the promotion of the album online and in print)<br/><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>How many discouraged people have you come across recently?<br/>How many music lovers have you come across recently?<br/>How much would another POSITIVE platform improve the community and the world (especially in light of all the negativity that is easily accesible)?<br/></p>
<p>I could go on and on. The reality is that my completing this project is a NECESSITY! Not only for me because it's my purpose - but because someone NEEDS TO BE INSPIRED, ENCOURAGED and EMPOWERED! </p>

<p>I’m so excited to share my first EP with you! It has been a dream of mine for a long time to record a professional album.</p>

<p>Eight months ago, I
quit my nine-to-five job, got rid of most of my stuff, left my hometown in

nature, discovery, travel, and freedom. I was terrified...but I wasn't going to let that stop me.</p>

I've worked at Yellowstone National Park as a dishwasher and busser, worked with animals on a ranch, visited 15 states and tons of cities, played open mics, worked on my music, and I've done a lot of soul searching. This journey is about confronting fears, breaking free from expectations, searching for belonging, going after what you really want - even if it's hard or unconventional, and creating the life you want to live.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<br/>I'm Kiran Young Wimberly, an American Presbyterian minister who lived for over six years in Belfast, Northern Ireland. <b>During that time, I fell in love with traditional Irish music, but I couldn't figure out why I wasn't hearing more of it in church. </b>In the States, Presbyterians break into Irish melodies without a second thought.<b> </b>But it took me a while to grasp that, generally speaking, Protestants in Northern Ireland don't do much traditional Irish music. They see it as something belonging to the Catholic community. <i><b>And with the conflicted past of Northern Ireland, and the separation that still exists between these groups, Irish music seldom finds its way into Presbyterian worship services. </b></i><br/><br/>Yet, I was so completely drawn to these old melodies that I couldn't get away from them. They floated through my head, day and night. I was captivated. I became a 'trad' nerd, memorizing the names of the greatest singers, the airs, the fine differences between the versions, and their origins. Any time I was in the car, I had CDs from my trad singing class on repeat. <b>I absorbed everything I could about this music - which of course, had once traveled across the ocean and into the Appalachian mountains and had influenced the very folk culture of my own American heritage.</b> I felt like I was tapping into my musical roots: the music that touched my soul more deeply than any other. <br/><br/><b>But more than anything, I was struck by the sacred quality of this music. </b>The soulful, heartrending quality of the melodies. The soulful stories of love and loss. I longed to hear this quality of music in the context of worship. <b>These old songs reminded me of the ancient prayers of love and loss, joy and sorrow, hope and lament, that we find in the psalms. </b><br/><br/>So one day I sat down with my guitar, a psalm, and an old Irish harp melody floating in my head. <b>What emerged that night in the quiet of my living room was my <a href=""http://www.celticpsalms.com/portfolio/psalm-63-o-god-you-are-my-god/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first ""Celtic Psalm.""</a></b> After a few months I arranged another, and then another, and eventually, I had an album's worth of songs.<b> <br/><br/>But I didn't want to record an album alone. </b>I wanted harmony, and I wanted great Irish musicianship.

Lifting Voices as One

People say they are touched by our music; that they feel inspired, uplifted, and comforted. The words of the psalms, combined with the soulful Irish and Scottish melodies, results in music that reaches straight to the heart. It might simply seem like beautiful music, but in Northern Ireland, the fact that we are 'cross-community' - that is, crossing the separation between Protestants and Catholics in this post-conflict society - makes the Celtic Psalms project meaningful in a much deeper way. Through our music, we bring together musicians from both backgrounds, and we have shared our music at venues in both communities and in mixed gatherings. It is rare and significant when Protestants and Catholics come together to do music, and even rarer and more significant when that music is in the context of worship. Some of the most meaningful comments I've heard are: (from a Protestant) ""I never thought these songs could belong to us,"" and (from a Catholic) ""I never thought I'd hear our music in a Protestant church.""          Here, we forge a new opportunity for Protestants and Catholics to pray                     together through the psalms, and to lift our voices as one. And in the meantime, we have a blast. We love doing this music together. The whole experience has been brimming with joy, laughter, and life. That picture right under these words? That was taken right after we finished recording our second album. See that rainbow? A sign of promise if there ever was one.  



That's our story. 

And now, we are bringing our story - and our music - to the Northeast US. Though Kelly (the mom) lived here for a bit and Declan (the dad) has visited, it will be the first visit for Ellen and Chloe (the daughters and lead singers). We'll be starting in Princeton, New Jersey, and then venturing into Pennsylvania, Washington DC, Connecticut, and New York City.

<p>When I first recorded my debut record, Pistol, I had been exclusively listening to classic
country music.  I remember being on tour playing DJ in the van when my drummer explained to me how imperative it was for my musical and creative growth to expand my music library beyond that of solely

<br/></div>","WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN?As some of you likely know, I am Kayla Howran and I am launching this campaign in hopes to raise enough money to fund the recording and release of my next full length album. 
We are set to hit The Bathouse Recording Studio
in Kingston, ON with friend and producer, Colin Cripps in March 2016.  The Bathouse Studio offers the best in
vintage recording and has been the walls which surrounded the making of Blue Rodeo
records, Tragically Hip records and Kathleen Edwards’ records to name a few.  Colin Cripps is a Canadian guitarist and producer, as well as a member of Blue Rodeo and The Jim Cuddy Band.  He has performed
with, produced, and written material for Kathleen Edwards, Sarah
McLachlan, and Bryan Adams. 
WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM THE NEW ALBUM?
When I first recorded my debut record, Pistol, I had been exclusively listening to classic
country music.  I remember being on tour playing DJ in the van when my drummer explained to me how imperative it was for my musical and creative growth to expand my music library beyond that of solely
country music.  At the time I scoffed at
him.  Over time I was introduced to CBC Radio and realized the great amounts of inspiring, current music and talent that exists.  In
opening my ears to all of this new music and quickly growing into a fan, my songwriting and musical direction has naturally evolved.  This upcoming album is premeditated, unlike
my last.  In the past four years, I have
learned so much and grown as both a person and a musician and you can expect this album to reflect that.  I have
eliminated many of the distractions that used to hinge any personal creative
achievement and I’m very excited about what I’ve come up with since.HOW MUCH AND WHY?

<p><i>Paul Klee: Painted Songs </i>is a large and complex series, making it difficult to apply for grants and other funding. Additionally, some grants require partial funding before matching additional funds are granted. Because so many musicians and ensembles are interested, we want to share the project by combining our resources and supporters.</p>
<p>Our current goal is <strong>$5,000</strong>, which would fund 5 projects at $1,000 each.</p>
<p><u>Other reasons to contribute include:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cross-disciplinary work</strong> between audio, visual art, and dance!</li>
<li>
<strong>Educational opportunities </strong>for musicians who want to share the works in classrooms!</li>
<li>Supporting <strong>new music</strong> by <strong>living composers</strong> and hardworking musicians!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>More About <i>Paul Klee: Painted Songs</i>
</h3>
<p>Each piece within <i>Paul Klee: Painted Songs</i> can be performed separately and is considered an independent, free-standing musical work. But, performers are encouraged to re-contextualize these pieces into ""galleries."" Like a curator of an art gallery, performers can combine these works in any order or number, interpolate them with other works by other composers, or arrange them for different instrumental forces. Currently, around thirty works are completed and over a hundred works are in progress or planned.</p>
<p><u>Major sections of the project include:</u></p>
<p><strong>Solos</strong> (3 movement works for 18 wind, string, keyboard, or percussion instruments called ""Portraits, Scenes and Symbols"")</p>
<p><strong>Quartets</strong> (2 movement works for consort ensembles, 4 flutes, 4 oboes, 4 trumpets etc., each quartet is inspired by paintings of birds or fish)</p>
<p><strong>Galleries </strong>(5 to 9 movements works for mixed ensembles, such as Gallery II for Pierrot ensemble, Gallery IV for the ""Quartet for the End of Time"" quartet, or Gallery VIII ""The Moon Dream"" for octet)</p>
<p><strong>Flex Ensemble </strong>(10 pieces for any size or type of ensemble using different forms of improvisation, graphic scores, instructional pieces, or conduction based on ""magic square"" paintings)</p>

Additionally, some grants require partial funding before matching additional funds are granted. Because so many musicians and ensembles are interested, we want to share the project by combining our resources and supporters.
Our current goal is $5,000, which would fund 5 projects at $1,000 each.
Other reasons to contribute include:


Cross-disciplinary work between audio, visual art, and dance!

Educational opportunities for musicians who want to share the works in classrooms!
Supporting new music by living composers and hardworking musicians!


More About Paul Klee: Painted Songs

Each piece within Paul Klee: Painted Songs can be performed separately and is considered an independent, free-standing musical work. But, performers are encouraged to re-contextualize these pieces into ""galleries."" Like a curator of an art gallery, performers can combine these works in any order or number, interpolate them with other works by other composers, or arrange them for different instrumental forces. Currently, around thirty works are completed and over a hundred works are in progress or planned.
Major sections of the project include:
Solos (3 movement works for 18 wind, string, keyboard, or percussion instruments called ""Portraits, Scenes and Symbols"")
Quartets (2 movement works for consort ensembles, 4 flutes, 4 oboes, 4 trumpets etc., each quartet is inspired by paintings of birds or fish)
Galleries (5 to 9 movements works for mixed ensembles, such as Gallery II for Pierrot ensemble, Gallery IV for the ""Quartet for the End of Time"" quartet, or Gallery VIII ""The Moon Dream"" for octet)
Flex Ensemble (10 pieces for any size or type of ensemble using different forms of improvisation, graphic scores, instructional pieces, or conduction based on ""magic square"" paintings)
Other Ways You Can Help

If you know any interested musicians or ensembles, please let them know it is not too late to join the consortium! They can contact Jonathan Posthuma directly through his website.

Attend our fundraiser kick-off concert on October 17, Studio Z in Saint Paul, MN
Attend Paul Klee's 140th Birthday Celebration on December 19, location TBD.
Share your donation to social media, explaining why you support new music!
Tell family, friends, or colleagues that may be interested!
Support each of the participating ensembles directly by attending their concerts, events, through a donation, or by subscribing to their newsletters!

<p>Hello beautiful human!</p>
<p>I've got a bunch of new studio songs to share with you, and the time has come to bring them into the world and make them real. I really want to give these songs their best chance with amazing physical media (including vinyl!) and a promotional campaign to help them get into as many ears as possible. You can help breathe life into this music, and I've put together a lot of cool perks and rewards to thank you. So please take a look at the different rewards on the page--I really think you're going to find something you love!</p>
<h3>What's This Album About?</h3>
<p>If you have been following me for any length of time, you know that I think music is a legit form of healing magic. When we hear a song that touches on our own painful experiences, we actually start to heal and feel better. We feel better because it finally lets us cry, or because it reminds us of how far we've come, or just because we finally feel seen and understood. Music lets us know we're not alone in our struggle. So--the short answer is that this album is about getting real and finding healing.</p>
<h3>OK, So What Does ""Shadow Work"" Mean?</h3>
<p>The phrase ""shadow work"" comes out of the Jungian pyschological concept of the shadow. Our shadow is all the parts of ourselves that we have hidden away for some reason over the years. Shadow work means showing up for every part of ourselves -- including the dark parts, and the parts that we pushed down because we didn't feel safe to share them at the time.</p>
<p>As we do this work, we get to understand ourselves better. Sometimes, this work is scary, because it puts us face to face with our inner demons. But when we look our greatest fears in the eye, we learn what's really behind them, and the truth can set us free. Shadow work gives us the opportunity to heal our wounds, and choose to live beyond them. </p>
<p>This album is about my own personal journey with shadow work, and I hope it also brings hope and grace to <i>your</i> journey. 2020 really forced many of us to come face to face with our worst fears! I want this album to help you find the strength you need to get through difficult times, and to shine a light in the darkness. We have all had to struggle. But we don't have to do it alone.</p>
<h3>What Am I Fundraising For?</h3>
<p>Primarily, I am raising funds to make the digital and physical experience of this album as amazing as possible.</p>
<p><strong>VINYL:</strong> I've never done a vinyl release before, and people have been asking for it for years. I did a lot of research, and also got feedback from you, to really figure out what would make it a supremely cool vinyl experience. What I've heard from you is that lyrics and production credits are a must have (I agree) and that a beautiful, exciting visual experience is really meaningful too. So I made those things a priority in my choices. </p>
<p><strong>CDs:</strong> I'm also doing a small CD run and I'm not skimping on that either -- if you have my last album, Rising Rising Rising on CD you know that it came with a beautiful ecowallet plus a lyric insert, and I'm going to be doing this CD at that same level of quality.  </p>
<p>Let's talk about <strong>artwork</strong>. I've commissioned Delia Stanley to do the artwork for the cover. She has shown me some early sketches and I'm so so excited -- this is absolutely going to be the most gorgeous art on anything I've ever released. As soon as the cover is ready I'll be sharing it here and on social media!</p>
<p>Physical media costs a lot to manufacture and ship - but it's really important to me to give you something really beautiful and special to hold in your hands, and play on your stereo. And yes, of course this will be released digitally too -- everyone who contributes at any level will be getting a digital download of both Mp3s and lossless FLAC files. </p>
<p><strong>T-SHIRTS, STICKERS, AND MORE:</strong> Overwhelmingly, when I asked you what bonuses would be special to have with the album, I got responses like: t-shirts, stickers, and buttons. Your wish is my command. If you've bought a shirt or other apparel from me before, you know I care a lot about making sure that it's something that feels great to wear -- as well as fair manufacturing practices that do not involve sweatshop labor. I've done the research and found really great providers to bring high quality, awesome merch your way.</p>
<p><strong>PROMOTION TO GIVE THESE SONGS THEIR BEST CHANCE:</strong> My dad and I have spent the last several years working incredibly hard on these songs in the studio, and it's been an absolute labor of love for both of us. I want to honor these songs by putting them out into the world as powerfully as possible. I have found someone I know and trust to help me get them onto radio and playlists -- and ultimately into more ears. I believe my life's work is to connect and heal through music. By being a part of this album, you are helping me live that calling.</p>
<h3>So...Go Pick Out Something Nice For Yourself!</h3>
<p>Over the last few months I've been using social media and email to ask what would be most exciting and delightful to you. I've paid close attention and I've come up with a list of rewards and perks that I think you'll really love. If there's something that's NOT here that you want to see, please tell me! If I possibly can, I want to make it happen for you.</p>
<p>Thank you for being on this journey with me. I'm so grateful that you're in my world, and we get to share this magic together.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Being a creative entrepreneur can be challenging but I am committed to constantly find new ways to bring my vision to life to entertain the world. By sponsoring this campaign you will help me complete my sophomore album, <strong>Harder 2 Love</strong>.  </p>
<p>My name is Richard ""Rich Prince"" Daniel and I am a South Florida -based entrepreneur and the founder of Visionary Music Creators.

After exploring various career paths, in 2008 I took the plunge to further explore my music career.</p>
<p>After evaluating whether to dedicate my time to music or sports. My passion for music superseded, and eventually, I became fully consumed with music and entertainment. My current break out song, “TikTok” has gained local and international attention for its fun and true representation of the vibe and cultural diversity of the Miami music scene.</p>
<p>I can relate to the struggles of building from the bottom up and I am passionate about visiting as many Cities as possible across the world to help to support small local businesses. There are many motivated and driven business owners who may sometimes lack the resources and are rarely given the opportunity to take their product to the next level.

<h3>Hola.</h3>
<p>Soy Alejandro Biel, guitarrista y compositor de The Wall.</p>
<p>Con ya más de veinte años componiendo y tocando por toda España, The Wall y la música han sido mi pasión. El grupo se formó en los 90, en Montalbán (Teruel), tenemos ya 3 discos creados y varios conciertos a nuestras espaldas.</p>
<p>El grupo lo componen Oscar (cantante y guitarra), Boris (bajo), Edu (teclados y bateria) y Alejandro (guitarra) perfilando un estilo heterogéneo pero siempre enmarcado en un estilo pop rock cantado en castellano.</p>
<p>Este será nuestro cuarto disco ""estrellas en el muro"". Disco completamente conceptual, una obra que tiene que ser entendida como algo grandioso, un recorrido vital, un momento concreto en el tiempo, una historia en la que se ven reflejadas las vivencias, la evolución de una persona, un despertar, una ilusión, pero también su contraparte más cínica y pesimista.</p>
<p>Debido al tamaño y al número de canciones, el CD será doble, resulta imprescindible para hablar de todo aquello que nos apasiona, nos hace felices, nos pone tristes, nos hace reir y un largo etc... Toda una vida en la que atravesaremos varias fases, descubriremos el mundo y veremos su lado mas optimista y pesimista, las 2 caras de la historia.</p>
<p>Queremos que nos ayudéis con este proyecto tan complejo, tan importante y tan ilusionante.</p>
<p>Es un proyecto que lleva 10 años en mi cabeza, la idea de transmitir un concepto, una historia. Amasando ideas, letras, acordes..., todo que confluya en una obra que esperamos de corazón os guste tanto como a nosotros.</p>
<h3>Que necesitamos.</h3>
<p>Necesitamos de vuestra ayuda para hacer realidad el proyecto, se necesita mucho dinero para producir, editar y finalmente crear el CD físico.</p>

<h3>Que obtendreis</h3>
<p>Vamos a ofrecer diversas modalidades para conseguir ""estrellas en el muro"", desde una ayuda desinteresada, pasando por el CD físico, la descarga digital, una camiseta con el logo, una ""clase privada"", obtener otros CDs de The Wall.</p>

<h3>El reto</h3>
<p>Estrellas en el muro no va a ser un CD mas, no son canciones cualquiera, es una historia, una vida plasmadas en bastantes canciones.</p>

<h3>Hey!</h3>
<p>I'm CAT, a 22-year-old singer/songwriter from Chicago living in Los Angeles. I identify as New Wave and Psych Pop. I've been writing music for over ten years in my journals and on piano. My music is heavily inspired by 70's and 80's pop culture, artists and musicians such as Prince, David Bowie, Blondie, The Carpenters, Fleetwood Mac, Nancy Sinatra and Van Halen with modern influencers such as Charli XCX, Carly Rae Jepson, Tennis and Angel Olsen.  </p>
<p>One of my favorite things about creating music is exploring and experimenting with different styles. I have FOUR songs I'm hoping to record and release that play around with DIFFERENT vibes and influences while still being fun and true to my writing. I'm hoping to bring back classic elements from cool earlier eras and merge them with a modern sound.   </p>
<p>I need YOUR help! </p>
<p>Recording and producing each song is $900 plus $350 for mixing and $70 for mastering. I'm looking to raise $6,000 to record the four songs for digital release. I need to compensate other musicians and artists, as well as get some merch out there! Music and writing is my world and achieving this project would be a dream. It would also get some pretty catchy tunes out in the world and let me not eat only soup. </p>
<p>There are some cool and fun perks to make things a lil more exciting including a free digital download of the songs. $1, 440 is the benchmark for each new song so it's up to us, my dear friends, to how many songs will get released this year! If you can't donate, no fret! We're still friends! I just ask if you could share with your friends, families, co-workers, and strangers at the bar to help spread the word!! </p>

<p>Want to help produce the next Jane Getter Premonition album? </p>
<p>JGP’s next album will continue my exploration of progressive rock/jazz. I’m really excited about my new music; the songs have power, heart and soul. I always love the writing process and can't wait to see it all come to life!</p>
<p>With your support, we’ll record and release the new album by the end of 2019. We hope you’ll join us on the journey by donating and/or spreading the word!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHO IS JANE GETTER PREMONITION?</strong></h3>
<p>I’m <strong>Jane Getter</strong> - guitarist, composer, singer and bandleader. The guitar has always been it for me. When I was eight, I had the privilege of taking piano lessons, but I would secretly spy on my sister's guitar lessons. I felt pulled toward that instrument. The sounds it made and the strumming of the strings fascinated me. My parents eventually got the message and let me switch to guitar. I never looked back. By high school, I was writing my own music. When I saw Bonnie Rait, my first female role model, I saw something beyond strumming chords and singing, and started playing more intricate guitar riffs, phrases and solos. </p>
<p>The many different kinds of music I love and appreciate come together organically in my eclectic style, from rock to jazz, metal to singer-songwriter, world music to blues and funk to classical. My playing and touring background has given me the opportunity to explore a range of styles and sounds while working with NBC's SNL Band, Brother Jack McDuff, Ursala Dudziak, The Roots the jam, Lenny White of Return to Forever, Jaimoe of the Allman Brothers and many more. Winning ASCAP’s Award for Music for Theatre and Dance was a high point for me; I don’t think my eight-year old self imagined winning an award as a composer!</p>
<h3>My Band:</h3>
<ul>

JGP’s next album will continue my exploration of progressive rock/jazz. I’m really excited about my new music; the songs have power, heart and soul. I always love the writing process and can't wait to see it all come to life!
With your support, we’ll record and release the new album by the end of 2019. We hope you’ll join us on the journey by donating and/or spreading the word!
 
WHO IS JANE GETTER PREMONITION?
I’m Jane Getter - guitarist, composer, singer and bandleader. The guitar has always been it for me. When I was eight, I had the privilege of taking piano lessons, but I would secretly spy on my sister's guitar lessons. I felt pulled toward that instrument. The sounds it made and the strumming of the strings fascinated me. My parents eventually got the message and let me switch to guitar. I never looked back. By high school, I was writing my own music. When I saw Bonnie Rait, my first female role model, I saw something beyond strumming chords and singing, and started playing more intricate guitar riffs, phrases and solos. 
The many different kinds of music I love and appreciate come together organically in my eclectic style, from rock to jazz, metal to singer-songwriter, world music to blues and funk to classical. My playing and touring background has given me the opportunity to explore a range of styles and sounds while working with NBC's SNL Band, Brother Jack McDuff, Ursala Dudziak, The Roots the jam, Lenny White of Return to Forever, Jaimoe of the Allman Brothers and many more. Winning ASCAP’s Award for Music for Theatre and Dance was a high point for me; I don’t think my eight-year old self imagined winning an award as a composer!
My Band:

Keyboards - Adam Holzman currently plays and tours in Steven Wilson’s band. A former musical director and keyboard player for Miles Davis, Adam is also the son of Elektra Records founder, Jac Holzman. 
Guitar - Alex Skolnick plays in the band  Testament and has played with Ozzy Osbourne. In addition to his metal roots, he has performed with his jazz trio in festivals around the world.
Drums - Chad Wackerman spent ten years working with Frank Zappa. He has recorded and toured with Alan Holdsworth, Steve Vai and James Taylor, among others. 
Bass - Mark Egan has recorded and toured with Pat Metheny, Gil Evans, Stan Getz, Sting and so many more. 
-Stu Hamm is known for his live and session work for numerous artists including Joe Satriani and Steve Vai.
Vocals and other special guest artists TBA! Watch for updates!

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello all, my name is Mimi Nichole I have been singing, acting, and dancing since the age of 5. My foundation is rooted from the church, as I began to grow up I started to explore the ins and outs of my musicality by writing about life experiences and branching out to sing different genres of music. I am so happy to say that because of my exploration, I was blessed to turn songs that have been recorded over the past five years of my life into an album and I cant wait for you all to listen and enjoy ! </p>

I'm RRO keyboardist and composer Gregg Fox. I just want to say thank you for helping me create something quite miraculous in the world of music! With the help and support of SO many of you through our first Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign the Renaissance Rock Orchestra was able to record and release an amazing album called ""In Times Of Olde"". This groundbreaking record featured performances by rock artists from legendary bands like AC/DC, Guns N Roses, Ozzy, Foreigner, Black Sabbath, YES, Heart & Whitesnake and has received rave reviews world wide!  We were even able to enlist Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame inductees from Yes & Heart  drummer Alan White and guitarist Howard Leese to join us on the record and the result was magical! ""In Times Of Olde"" has been praised by fans and reviewers around the globe and it has help create a super group of remarkable artists that is now preparing to tour worldwide...AND WE'D LIKE TO DO IT FOR YOU AGAIN on a new record called ""Magic In The Air""!HERE'S JUST A FEW TESTIMONIALS FROM OUR FANS!“The amazing energy of brilliant rock musicians coupled with intricate and melodic arrangements make Renaissance Rock Orchestra a powerhouse group” - Jim Ervin, President, Warrior Records""Unbelievable!! This is amazing!” - Phil Anderson""It’s an AMAZING album! I love every song!” - Joanne Beverina Bilodeau“Beautiful orchestral Rock and Roll majesty rolled into an all-star line up of players…. superb job!"" - Adam Nicholson“True musical mastery"" - AlterMan Listen to a SAMPLER of RRO's last release ""IN Times OF Olde""! :-) Please click here to take a look at the  ARTIST PRESENTATION DECK we prepared for the tour!  We'd like to move forward with a new record for you called ""Magic In The Air""!I have a VERY exciting line-up of rockstars who will perform on the new record along with many of your favorite and beloved artists from our prestigious list of world-class RRO alumni talent from the first 2 records! WHO WILL BE ON THE NEW RECORD?!!!!  BECOME A CONTRIBUTOR AND YOU will be the FIRST to find out as the record is recorded!The costs to produce a record of this quality and with artists of this caliber and notoriety make this a challenging proposition! Here's how we propose to do it.It will be approximately $15,000 to record, produce, and master 5 songs with these ( and other) known and respected rock artists of this caliber. They are all extremely busy with very lucrative projects and the compensation to them has to be comparable and meet industry standards. Therefore our clever plan is to release a ""Magic In The Air"" EP if we only hit our first goal! If we surpass that and get to a minimum of $30,000 we will release a full 10 song CD!Please remember that it takes a lot to hire a real rockstar so the more you contribute the BIGGER the stars! Can you just imagine... Mickey Thomas from Jefferson Starship? Neal Schon from Journey? Sebastian Bach from Skid ROW? Slash from Guns N Roses? Kevin Cronin from REO? The sky is the limit! Our last record hit a home run with guitar masters like George Lynch ( Dokken / Lynch Mob), Whitesnake/TSO gunslinger Joel Hoekstra and Guns N’ Roses/Sons Of Apollo guitar wizard Ron “Bumblefoot” Thal.Check out this brilliant guitar solo from our last record “In Times Of Olde"" by Guns N' Roses and Sons Of Apollo guitar wizard Ron ""Bumblefoot"" Thal! 

 
If we hit $30,000 you will receive the digital download of the first 5 songs in April and we will continue on to finish the full 10 song CD and you'll get your physical copy by the end of August. We know times are hard and to complete a successful crowdfunding campaign to fund an epic project of this scope will be VERY difficult!  We can only hope that when you see and hear what we created on ""In Times Of Olde"" you will be moved by the musical mastery and the beauty of the music and help us finish another epic masterpiece! Please have a listen! Apple Music Spotify Bandcamp  It will take ALL of you to SHARE with your friends and family and on all social media platforms and to DIG DEEPLY for us to reach this significant goal! ( We are very thankful our fan base is continuing to grow as more and more people become a part of Team RRO...and we will be counting on all of you!)I can't tell just HOW MUCH I appreciate ALL of YOU who helped us record and release ""In Times Of Olde""! It has turned out to be one of the greatest accomplishment of my life and I am forever grateful and indebted to you all!Please consider one of our very prestigious PRODUCER rewards and you will be a huge part of something that will be of historical proportions in the world of rock! Your name will be listed on the CD as a PRODUCER and on all of our websites and our social media sites. IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE Back-Stage Passes and special VIP Meet & Greet opportunities! As an ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, ""GOLD"" PRODUCER or MASTER PRODUCER you will receive VIP Back-Stage passes! Thank you for helping me create another beautiful Renaissance Rock Orchestra record! With YOUR HELP it will be another amazing journey forward in the evolution of RRO and another significant and historical collaboration that will be a piece of rock history!",41.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello! I am Amy Duncan, a singer-songwriter based in Edinburgh currently working on my 7th album. I write from personal experience, and lately have found inspiration from my abstract photography. I am currently fully and joyfully immersed in the recording process!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571324750/rfi9ppsdffh7us0s8rjc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I feel very excited about this album which I am producing with the brilliant engineer Cameron Malcolm.</p>
<p>There will be around 12 tracks on which I play guitar, piano, synths and electric upright bass. Guy Nicolson plays drums, tablas, and percussion.</p>
<p>In the lead up to the launch I am releasing 3 singles as animated music videos created by Tracy Foster who is using photographs which have influenced some of the songs as a starting point.</p>
<p>Here is the first single:</p>

<p>I think this album I am working on is my strongest to date. I am getting much closer to the sound I want to produce and greater clarity about what I want to say.</p>
<p>When I started recording in my late teens there was just a raw need to hear my voice and words singing back at me because it felt like proof that I exist. Songwriting became a way for me to work through many difficult times and has been the one constant throughout life.</p>

If not, you can still discover it with the video below.  I just released a couple of singles called 'The World Won't Wait for You' and ‘Then You’ll Go Far’ to announce my new EP.   EP cover: With enough support, there will be more music after this EP too. It's what I do; I write songs about life and emotion. Every day, I reach out to people to try and connect with them individually and listen to my music. By doing that, I'm proud to say that I have 1000+ people who really like my music. And I have exchanged messages with every single one of these people. I am working hard at distributing my music in the cheapest way possible, and I know that even with a moderate amount of money (much less than what a record label would give me) I could really scale up this operation, make much more music, and make much more online content: live videos, music videos and more. This upcoming EP needs to be heard by more people. It's why, today, I'm asking for your help. No... I'm not asking. I'm inviting YOU to come on this journey with me and be part of this story. All of the perks I have set up are tailored to help me invest in spreading the word and reach more people with my music. A label will waste £150,000 promoting a project like mine. I'm working with talented friends willing to help me, and I know that with £15,000, we can do incredible things. £15,000 is not a lot from more than 1,000 people who love my music.It would completely pay for another EP, and it would allow me to market the upcoming EP well enough to be able to make more music and merch for everyone moving forward! Here is how I will spend this budget:£4000 for the recording of the next 4 song EP. I'm lucky enough to have talented friends who are helping me by lowering their fees.£1000  to make the merch.£10,000 in press, radio placements, and advertisements. For marketing and communication, it's not that high a budget, but it would be enough to put my music in front of many more people with a similar taste. Beautiful live videos and music videos will come soon after the lockdown. I can give my best only because of people like you. All together, we can make things happen. Great things. Thanks to you, my fan, my supporter, my friend...Mungo Parker",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>STARTING TODAY 2021 was inspired by a speech made by President-Elect Joe Biden and by the selection of VP-Elect Kamala Harris.  This song is a  a joyous choral work that was written to inspire and encourage the US and entire world with a virtual choral production and video, as we move forward with healing, hope and the promise of a new and wonderful future. </p>
<p>Starting Today was written in the dark, literally. The composer, Patricia Tyson a hospice nurse by profession and musician by passion, wrote Starting Today 2021 during her difficult recuperation from major eye surgery- a macular hole repair. With one eye, Patricia was able to put together an amazing group of singers and production crew who will sing and produce this project, virtually. We are composed of stellar, world-class artists who live all over the US, and some have never personally met Patricia face-to-face, but we are all connected by our passion for music, desire to help others and our positivity! Our video presentation will feature the Divine 9, instrumentalists, dancers, singers and the American people who represent the diversity of WE, the people. Join with us as we sing and dance boldly into 2021, into healing and full of hope! </p>
<p>We are hoping to raise at least $25,000 to cover the cost of production which includes music production, photography, videography, distribution, marketing, operating expenses and budgeting.  Anything raised over this amount will go to helping families directly affected by COVID-19. </p>
<p>We will offer tier-based rewards to those who give, as follows:</p>
<p>$100 or more - you will receive a commemorative DVD which will be a keepsake reminder of Starting Today 2021 for your pledge of $100 or more.</p>
<p>$50 - the giver of $50 will receive an autographed copy of the lead sheet of Starting Today 2021. This song can be sung by other choirs or community groups. Share the hope!</p>
<p>$25 - for this $25 pledge, you will get a Starting Today 2021 t-shirt in your specified size. This can be a great conversation starter!</p>
<p>$5 - Everyone who gives $5 to Starting Today 2021 will get a washable, reusable face mask with our logo. Be safe, be happy!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Bri and this is my band, Divorce Care.</p>
<p>Three years ago I moved to my dream city, with the goal of starting a band and writing music I can be truly proud of. Through the beautifully connected music scene here, I've found myself surrounded by and working with people I admire and respect the most in the industry, and I am confident that the pieces are finally in place to realize this dream. </p>
<p>This band and this album represent some of the hardest, darkest moments in my life, when the only positive thing I could do was write a song. Moments of healing, introspection, and acceptance were my muse. This collection of songs are distillations of some of these profound moments and I’m ready to share them, but I need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's what it will take and where your money will go: </p>
<ul>
<li>Production, engineering and mixing the album.</li>
<li>Hiring two professional musicians to play bass and drums. </li>
<li>Mastering the album for release.</li>
<li>Design of album artwork.</li>
<li>Distribution of album. </li>
<li>Design, ordering and distribution of merch. </li>
</ul>
<p>I'll be working with an incredible producer, named Andy Park. There's nobody else I want to create this album with and I trust him entirely, knowing the quality investment he'll put into every song. The fact that he wants to make this record with me is beyond humbling - take my word for it. Want to see his work? Check it out here: <a href=""http://www.andyparkrecording.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.andyparkrecording.com</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Taking almost three years to write this album, there's one thing I'm absolutely certain of at this point: I have to do this right. From start to finish, I want this album to be the absolute best it can be. I've never had this level of commitment to anything. Andy and these incredible musicians are what will see it through to that level of completion. </p>
<p>While my story and journey are entirely personal and relative to what I've experienced, I believe that others who have been through or are going through similar things will find something in them. If nothing else, to know they're not alone. I hope this album can provide that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At this point, most of the risks and challenges are behind me. I've worked incredibly hard to get everything to where it is, ready to go for recording. I have 15 fully fleshed out demos, with everything written. The challenge in front of me is taking the years of my heart that I've poured into this and creating something truly wonderful.</p>
<p>I need you for that. </p>
<p>If our world was in a different state, I would be working my ass off to organize my band and play shows to raise the required funds for this project. But this is our reality and the challenge is figuring out a way to make this happen, at its absolute fullest potential. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There is ZERO pressure to contribute to this. We're all in varying states of life, with varying means and this year has left us all over the place. I'm with you. If you feel in any way connected to what I'm creating, but cannot contribute financially, you can still be a part of this. :) Here's what you can do: </p>
<ul>
<li>Share on your social channels: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat - even that cool new thing all the kids are doing, tik tok??</li>
<li>Send a good old fashioned email or text to those who may be interested</li>
<li>Or even *gasp* bring it up in conversation ;) </li>

</ul><p> </p><h2>The Impact &amp; Our Inspiration</h2><p>Our passion for this project comes from our own experiences as creative people. Each of us has a different story, but they all widely relate around the same plot. We all come from rural areas of North Carolina we call ""molding plants"" where creative individuals were chastised and challenged for having dreams outside of the ""mold"" of a farmer or factory worker. There's nothing wrong with physical labor, if that's where you find your purpose and joy in life. But not everyone exists for that purpose and no talent should go untapped because of tradition, insecurities or a fear of having big dreams. We're the dreaming, hopeful creatives who've cut out a nice little slice of the world for ourselves where we're free to work, cultivate and actively go after those dreams. But we don't want to stop there. We want everyone to dream and dream big. Art is big enough for anyone brave enough to share a little piece of themselves in their work with the world. There's no such thing as ""too many artists."" We firmly believe that. </p><p>That's where our idea came from. In our respective families, we have musicians and talented singers and lyrical artists - many of whom were told by teachers, coaches and other adults in places of authority that they would ""never make it"" off their talents, no matter how great they were or how hard they worked. As adults, we now understand that those were just the callous, jaded words of a failure who never had the courage to get back up and try again, or maybe never attempted to seek out their real passions in the first place. </p><p>NiaRuth has a sister with the voice of an angel. Kiersey has a brother with lyrics that would drag you down to the hidden depths of your own soul and feel every emotion imaginable. The lovebird duo has a son, several nieces and nephews and cousins aplenty with a plethora of musical talent. All these youths are being fed the same lie: ""you'll never make it."" But this generation is nothing if not resilient. They're retorting with a collective, ""oh yeah? Watch me!"" and we're here for it! </p><p>We put our minds together and thus the SyrenStar Mobile App was born. We've paired with a group of freelance app developers to bring an entirely new app with the power to make waves in the music industry as a whole. Gone are the days of being force-fed whatever ""the industry"" decides should be relevant. Music fans and unsigned artists want to take control of the music they hear and create. No musician should ever have to water down their talent under the guise of paying ""petty dues"" for some other artist to get their shine and no music fan should be limited to hearing only 29% of music that exists. That's right, the ""music industry"" monopoly controls over 70% of everything you hear! There are independent artists out there your soul has been waiting to discover. SyrenStar can make that happen.</p><p>We understand how life-changing success is for anyone, but especially how rare and unlikely it can seem for musicians and other creatives.

Our quartet consists of a writer, Kiersey, a social media manager, NiaRuth, and a couple of old matrimonial lovebirds with a passion and an idea. A passion for music and an an app that opens the channels between musicians, artists and singers and the ears who love to listen.What We're CreatingOur mission is simple: we want to bridge the ""stage gap"" between music lovers/fanatics and the artists who dream of performing for them, by eliminating the music industry's gate-keeping tactics and deliver a new live-competition + live-concert platform that evens the playing field for unsigned or independent artists. Our mobile app, SyrenStar, is that bridge. What We Need Any quick Google search will show you that the average cost of an app (a cheap one) is between $50k and $100k. We've already poured our savings (~25k) into this because we believe in what it could mean for musicians and how it could change music on a global level. So our goal is $75k. The entire goal will fund the building of our own server (needed for seamless live-streaming, cloud storage for the databases of our artist and fan accounts, the in-app store where artists' music and merch can be purchased, continuity of our multi-algorithmic AI system to match fan music preferences with artists who create it + match similarly tagged songs for quarterly competitions and fan voting + multi-level ""featuring"" system which collects data on how often an artist's page is visited and each individual song they upload is played in order to feature hidden talents at a higher rate when they are going unnoticed, and many more technical aspects that our app developers would have to translate from a numerical and technical language only they seem to understand into plain English to explain), the development of the app itself, and marketing to lure fans and artists across the globe to the app.What You Get  To ensure this app remains helpful for artists, we are unable to offer discounts on any artist merch or album/song costs, but you will get:A custom SyrenStar car decal
A SyrenStar keychain
A SyrenStar canvas tote
A SyrenStar phone case
A SyrenStar tumbler
A SyrenStar T-shirt  
The Full SyrenStar Fan Merch Pack | The Full SyrenStar Artist Merch Pack
A ""Founding Fan"" badge on your SyrenStar Fan profile | A ""Founding Artist"" badge on your SyrenStar Artist profile
An Honorable Mention as a Community Supporter in all 1st Year Concerts | Secured Spot in the Features promotion section for 3 months (artists only)
Free Concerts for 2 years + Physical Lanyard, Concert Bracelet & Custom Backstage Pass

50% off annual subscription for the app for life
Automatic induction into the First Look Club where you see/hear newest artists before anyone else
Optional guaranteed entry into our Beta Program, no application required
Exclusive Access to our first Beta Concert (with or without being a Beta Tester)
 The Impact & Our InspirationOur passion for this project comes from our own experiences as creative people. Each of us has a different story, but they all widely relate around the same plot. We all come from rural areas of North Carolina we call ""molding plants"" where creative individuals were chastised and challenged for having dreams outside of the ""mold"" of a farmer or factory worker. There's nothing wrong with physical labor, if that's where you find your purpose and joy in life. But not everyone exists for that purpose and no talent should go untapped because of tradition, insecurities or a fear of having big dreams. We're the dreaming, hopeful creatives who've cut out a nice little slice of the world for ourselves where we're free to work, cultivate and actively go after those dreams. But we don't want to stop there. We want everyone to dream and dream big. Art is big enough for anyone brave enough to share a little piece of themselves in their work with the world. There's no such thing as ""too many artists."" We firmly believe that. That's where our idea came from. In our respective families, we have musicians and talented singers and lyrical artists - many of whom were told by teachers, coaches and other adults in places of authority that they would ""never make it"" off their talents, no matter how great they were or how hard they worked. As adults, we now understand that those were just the callous, jaded words of a failure who never had the courage to get back up and try again, or maybe never attempted to seek out their real passions in the first place. NiaRuth has a sister with the voice of an angel. Kiersey has a brother with lyrics that would drag you down to the hidden depths of your own soul and feel every emotion imaginable. The lovebird duo has a son, several nieces and nephews and cousins aplenty with a plethora of musical talent. All these youths are being fed the same lie: ""you'll never make it."" But this generation is nothing if not resilient. They're retorting with a collective, ""oh yeah? Watch me!"" and we're here for it! We put our minds together and thus the SyrenStar Mobile App was born. We've paired with a group of freelance app developers to bring an entirely new app with the power to make waves in the music industry as a whole. Gone are the days of being force-fed whatever ""the industry"" decides should be relevant. Music fans and unsigned artists want to take control of the music they hear and create. No musician should ever have to water down their talent under the guise of paying ""petty dues"" for some other artist to get their shine and no music fan should be limited to hearing only 29% of music that exists. That's right, the ""music industry"" monopoly controls over 70% of everything you hear! There are independent artists out there your soul has been waiting to discover. SyrenStar can make that happen.We understand how life-changing success is for anyone, but especially how rare and unlikely it can seem for musicians and other creatives. In a world where everyone loves music, but not everyone sees the costly demands behind its creation, we want the majority of our app to be free to musicians striving to turn their art into a livable career. The only cost for artists on the SyrenStar app is the one-time fee (of no more than $0.75) to enter a song into the season competitions which occur 4 times a year. At minimum, at least 80% of all artist-related revenue to go to the artist directly so they can keep living their purpose and making this ball in space we exist on a little brighter with their musical creations.Risks & ChallengesThe biggest risk we face is not achieving the funding goal needed to bring the app into reality at the highest standard possible, but that won't stop us from moving forward with our plans. Our tiers are set up so that even if we don't meet our funding goal, we can still afford to ship out all physical perks and rewards. For perks directly reliant on the app, things would be a little trickier, but in the event we can't draw in enough for the app we would those backers upon request.Challenges are a dime a dozen. We live in an uncertain world, still dealing with a global plague, a shaky economy, and a society well overdue for an overhaul. Navigating entrepreneurial channels is as difficult as its ever been, but we believe in our team and where one of us falls short, the others are right there to pick up and shoulder a little extra responsibility when needed. We are looking into expanding our team and are in the process of interviewing for three more positions as things proceed.Other Ways You Can HelpEveryone can help make SyrenStar a reality and every effort counts!

<h2>what's going on?</h2>
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by my campaign for the debut solo album release 'Music I Had to Write' - a deeply reflective vocal and piano album of electronic music that I have written and produced over the last 10 months. For many of us, this year has been really tough mentally and if like me, potentially brought forward many of those challenging thoughts and aspects of life that have been somewhat hidden away in the busyness of modern living. With no gigs and reduced interaction life became pretty quiet for me, and at the same time my inner monologue and memories of past traumas (that I strongly work to avoid) suddenly got very loud and hard to suppress (...my usual coping mechanism). As I journeyed  through the inner work of recognising, starting to accept and gradually letting go (still working on this one) of the heavy armour of my childhood, this music, which has always been a creative therapy for me, started to appear to my mind. This not only helped me to document my emotional progression but also helped me to heal in a wonderfully creative and intimate way. This record marks the first chapter of this journey, producing a very personal and somewhat magical collection of music that I now feel (just about) ready to share with the world.</p>
<h2>why I need you!</h2>
<p>The album, which is planned to be distributed around November this year (with the first 'single' being out in June), will meet with many 'post-production' costs such as the music mastering, promotion, album artwork, video production and much more. And with this year being financially so difficult, to accomplish this release I am gratefully looking for donations to help cover the costs for the services mentioned above, so that I can release the album this year and ensure it is of the highest standard to reach a big audience. This creative venture is also a stepping stone for my musical career, which will help propel me into a new world of music (and a new chapter of life). For those who don't know me, here is a little overview of my journey so far...</p>
<h2>my journey so far</h2>
<p>'Ben is an award-winning saxophonist spearheading Sax Every Weekend, where he collaborates with a multitude of DJs around the UK and Europe. Hailing from a small town in Nottinghamshire, UK, Ben discovered his passion for music at age 11 when he was gifted keyboard and saxophone lessons by his grandad. By age 14 he was awarded a scholarship to Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester and then advanced his musical education by completing his degree at The Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester. Since then Ben has had many musical credits to his name including radio play on BBC Radio 1, performing saxophone with The Killer’s frontman Brandon Flowers and notable performances at Glastonbury Festival in 2017 with DnB godfather Tony Coleman (Hospital Records), as part of the London Elektricity Big Band. In his spare time, Ben teaches meditation and is a keen advocate of mental health awareness. He encourages meditation and mindfulness as a means to a healthy life and follows the Buddhist path.'</p>
<h2>what you get</h2>
<p>As many of you coming to this page will know me from the saxophone world, I have catered many of the 'perks' to be based around this. If you don't yet know how this works, you can select one of the 'perks' which range from costing £5 to £500 (for example, if you choose '£50 Sax Song Request' you will receive a personalised video of myself performing the saxophone to a song of your choice - anything goes :p), or you can simply donate any amount of your choosing by selecting the donate option on the page.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>WE ARE JEWELSTONE!!! Ranie Cunningham is the lead singer and sings soprano &amp; alto, Re'Sann Cunningham is our high-range soprano who sometimes sings alto, and Larsira Cunningham-Winston sings tenor and bass and sometimes alto as well.   We are an inspirational gospel group brought up in Detroit, Michigan.  Where we started singing in church. Our father Bishop Cunningham raised us in the church and we grew to love God. Our lives were changed forever on Easter Sunday, April 12, 1998, when our mother Missionary Denise Cunningham suddenly passed at the tender age of 38.  To honor her memory we changed our group name from the Cunningham Singers to ""Jewelstone"". The name represents who she was plus our father always referred to her as ""Jewel"", so it was only fitting to call ourselves Jewelstone.  As young women growing up in Detroit we learned quickly that the world wasn't a pretty place, times were hard and unkind.

<p>Our new project Luv(ed) One is very near and dear to us. As women we have experienced many things over the years and through it all we learned to depend on God. Not everyone knows that God can love on you when things happen out of your control.  But, this album will be full of love songs to you expressing how God can change the way you see yourself and others. This project is about loving yourself and all the things that make you ""you"". These songs will deal with self confidence, self esteem, self love, encouragement, fighting through, standing strong, keeping your head up and most importantly moving forward. ""Don't let your circumstance define you, let your actions do that!"" God is real and he is an untapped source that will help you deal with the most painful, ugly and discomforting situations. We don't have to deal with things alone. Our goal is to reach everyone with the power of positive thinking and love.</p>
<p>Now this is where you all come in.  The out of pocket expenses for this project is great so we need your help to make it a reality! We are offering you incentives for donating and assisting us in accomplishing our goals!</p>
<p>The studio we are working with is the Terminal Recording Studios, 370 Towne Center Pl., Ridgeland, Mississippi. We have chosen  producer and gospel recording artist  Paul Porter to produce this project; he is doing great work in the music industry. We will also be working with classical musicians such as violinists, flutist and even a xylophone player to create some mind-blowing music, we are very excited to work along side these inspiring musicians. Your contributions will fund the pre-production, production, editing, mixing, mastering, graphic design, CD pressing, distribution, marketing and PR. </p>

WE ARE JEWELSTONE!!! Ranie Cunningham is the lead singer and sings soprano & alto, Re'Sann Cunningham is our high-range soprano who sometimes sings alto, and Larsira Cunningham-Winston sings tenor and bass and sometimes alto as well.   We are an inspirational gospel group brought up in Detroit, Michigan.  Where we started singing in church. Our father Bishop Cunningham raised us in the church and we grew to love God. Our lives were changed forever on Easter Sunday, April 12, 1998, when our mother Missionary Denise Cunningham suddenly passed at the tender age of 38.  To honor her memory we changed our group name from the Cunningham Singers to ""Jewelstone"". The name represents who she was plus our father always referred to her as ""Jewel"", so it was only fitting to call ourselves Jewelstone.  As young women growing up in Detroit we learned quickly that the world wasn't a pretty place, times were hard and unkind. But God was our escape and we are grateful for His mercies.
We have teamed up Elrico Tunstall, owner of ""Manager of the Year"" and business partner Craigh Minc. They have used their knowledge of the Entertainment Industry to benefit our goals in music.  Together we are working to get this project off the ground.

<h2>Quick Overview:</h2>
<p>My name is Sahil Bahl and I am a singer-songwriter from LA, now based in Holland. I am recording my second album (an EP this time). It is a concept album to be paired with a series of 4 interconnected music videos. I have self-financed the recording of two songs and I could use your help in finishing the recordings, post-production and financing the videos.</p>
<p>You can choose from some ""perk"" packages and receive some unique rewards for specific donations. Click the ""perk"" boxes to what is included or scroll down for descriptions.</p>
<p>Or if you'd like to simply contribute, you can click ""back it"" or fill in an amount under ""make a contribution"" to donate an amount of your choosing.</p>
<p>If I do not reach the goal I have set, I will use your contributions to finance what I can and I will complete the project. You will be a big part of this production, so from the start of this campaign until the project is finished, I will keep you informed of the progress.</p>

<h2>The Concept:</h2>
<p><u>Songs:</u></p>
<p>The EP is called <i>Ask the Child. </i></p>
<p>During the period when I was writing these songs, I noticed this theme of childhood often coming up. I realized that I had hit a point in my life where I, someone with very much a ""do first, think later"" attitude, was actually taking a hard look back at what got me to where I am. I guess I was finally doing the ""think later"" part.</p>
<p>The album is therefore a cross-section of different periods of my life: childhood, adolescence, becoming an adult, even having a child of my own.  There is also an underlying theme of respect for the child. Whether it be the inner child or one you may have around<i>, </i>sometimes when you are really searching, a child can have the simplest answers. Quite often, that is exactly what we need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Videos:</u></p>
<p>There will be four interconnected music videos, each of which will reference and pay homage to a different film that struck me at a different point in my life. These are true classics that you will surely recognize.</p>

<p>J. S. Bach completed his Six Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin in 1720. Considered as ""The Himalayas of violinists"", these compositions include all possible human emotions on a celestial way.</p>
<p>To record these works is the most complex and challenging project to undertake for any violinist. One must be ready both physically and spiritually.</p>
<p><strong>Antal Zalai</strong>, whose musicality and talent have impressed Lord Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern, Lynn Harrell, Igor Oistrakh as well as Hollywood superstar Monica Bellucci and Charles, Prince of Wales among many others is working on this recording project.</p>
<p>The total time of the recording is about 140 minutes. It will be released in both audio and video format; the audio files will be available on all of the major on-line music stores, such as iTunes, Amazon MP3, Google Play as well as on streaming sites such as Spotify or Deezer. There will be a limited number of copies on physical double CDs. Videos will be available to stream on Antal's official YouTube channel, youtube.com/antalzalai and to stream or purchase on Amazon Video Direct.</p>
<p>Antal, for whom artistic freedom is essential, released several self-produced audio-video albums in the past few years on which he performs pieces of the violin repertoire requiring the utmost technical mastery. The collection on his YouTube channel and Facebook page with several million views includes Paganini's 24 Caprices, which have proved to be a grandiose success shared by several thousand viewers, and led to a number of requests for performances. The audio files of the videos – together with his previous CD recordings – are available on all of the major on-line music stores, and can also be bought in video format.</p>
<p>A recent comment on YouTube:<br/>""If someone would say that Antal Zalai was the greatest living classical violinist, he certainly wouldn't be wrong about that because David Oistrakh and George Enescu are both gone. The hope is with you my friend. Thank you for the effort to stay true to the music. Rare indeed.﻿""</p>
<p>All the previous audio-video recording projects were funded from Antal's own resources and he will continue to do so in the future as well. However it has been a great financial burden for him for several years, so he is hoping you can help defray the costs of this magical undertaking - to record J. S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin - via this Indiegogo campaign.</p>

<p>I am truly excited about my first Album.  I must confess that this is harder than producing Singles.  This album however is a journey through my Pop Rock  addictions, poetic mood swings into my wild and crazy Soca flings.   I am from the Caribbean islands of  Trinidad and Tobago hence the  10, 61  at the end of my name which represents the latitude and longitude coordinates for the island of Trinidad - actually its -61.    I am influenced heavily by  Soca, Rapso, and Calypso of my Caribbean home.  My home was always filled with music and my parents: an SDA pastor and mother who was a nurse provided my brother and I with a stable and humble life. </p>
<p>Beside working on this Album and singing I am an English teacher who works with many teens who don't know how to read and write. I have many boys - especially - who build great self esteem from reading.   Some even learn to write poems and great songs.  Many are motivated through my music to work harder.</p>
<p>Your donations are crucial to the fulfillment of my life's dream and future goals.  This album - ""Dariot"" is just the beginning of my international goal to Tour Canada and Europe. My West Indian culture is vibrant and unique.   My brand is new and original.  </p>

<h2>Who is the artist?</h2>
<p>My name is Joanne Togati and I'm originally from Brooklyn, NY.  I started studying opera when I was 15 and joined the regional theater company at Regina Pacis, a local company operating through the Church.  I majored in musical studies in college, studied and sang in German, Italian, French and English.  I appreciated my classical studies which taught me about discipline, grace of line, vocal beauty and a myriad of other fine qualities that a classical education can offer.  My heart just wasn't in it the way an opera singer needs to operate.  I wasn't ecstatic and after each performance, I never had the desire for ""more"".  As a young child, I also had a fascination with literature and poetry.  I walked away from my university education at NYU in comparative literature studies, and eventually earned my BA in English Literature. A poetry award later, I was still longing for the stage so I auditioned for Broadway and got to my 4th callback on the show La Boheme which ran for a short time.  I didn't make the final cut but it told me that singing was not something I should give up.  Years later, I was in a rockband, teaching myself how to sing pop music, no easy task for a former opera singer.  I stayed with it and before long my band was playing music conferences and festivals on the East Coast.  We were making it but band member problems cut our success short.  The band broke up and I was solo.  For the first time in my life, I was literally at the end of the road.  But I couldn't accept defeat.  I went on to gather a great group of jazz players and set out to make a jazz album instead.  Pressing on, I was introduced to Joe Galaxy in 2016 and was soon on the Ford Stage at Sunfest 2017 opening up for Joe who was opening up for Pitbull.  I couldn't believe my music career had taken me in this direction, but I simply rose to the task and wrote my first EDM song called Vine.  I felt that tingle that I had felt with my rockband and by the grace of God was resurrected back into the music industry.  </p>
<h2>Now I need the support that will help me truly succeed on this path.</h2>
<p>Soon after, I funded 4 tracks that cost me a total of $15,000 with photoshoots, wardrobe, video shoots and travel that brought that number up to $30000.  In order to continue, I spent $10,000 in marketing but that is just the beginning.  A true investment in the music business can easily cost $100,000 in the first year with everything being done properly.  </p>
<h3>Other important details about me that can help you contribute.</h3>
<p> In 2016, I was also managing my first 1 acre farm which I had built single handedly.  I had imported over 150 trees both exotic and domestic and discovered a superfood formula that cured Eczema as well as helping with a host of other skin conditions.  Music and my formula were now the 2 focuses of my life.  I envisioned buying hundred of acres and choosing to grow it all organically, supporting the permaculture effort so very needed today.  As a contributor you will be definitely helping me with both efforts by contributing to my campaign. I feel now that my life has a mission and if both music and the earth are yours, and even if they're not, you will be contributing to excellent causes.    Even if I don't meet my goal of $30,000, I will at least be able to  continue creating music to finish my album.  My goal ultimately is to work with a professional team to direct a truly artistic and well shot music video.  </p>
<p> During my filming of my first music video in Paris, I met the owner of Juicy Empire who offered me my first grand debut on New Years Eve at Nouveau Casino, Paris France, no easy feat for a budding EDM singer.  The funds I raise will help me operate while I am here in Paris, collaborating on my next album which is actually retro RnB in nature,</p>
<p>You can contribute on various levels which include merchandise, and an exciting opportunity to be part of a live show experience.  My music has been making an impact in Europe and doors started opening. I am now meeting with Dj's worldwide so I truly believe there is a future there for me but I do need your help now more than ever!  Follow my story on social media like Facebook and Instagram under Joanne Togati.  </p>
<p>This career is not for everyone.  The travel and preparation alone are not for the meek at heart but I have the drive and passion to do it.  I look forward to working with excellent music video directors and creatives in the arenas of fashion, production and photography.  I employ a number of individuals in the creative arts and they are all rooting for my success!  Thank you for being part of my journey!  </p>

<p>My name is Seth Fowler and one of my greatest joys is to be a worship leader and to adore Jesus through the creative vessel of music. I am passionate about seeing the Church encounter God in times of worship and I have been working diligently to write songs specifically for the Church to sing out to the Lord.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of worship music out in the world, but still I believe there is a need for fresh songs that are inspired by the Spirit and curated for the Church to sing. Songs that are simple and enjoyable, yet deep and meaningful. I have specifically focused on writing those types of songs, which has taken years of study, practice, and lessons in song-crafting. It's been a long journey to reach this point but it's been exciting and rewarding. </p>
<p>In April of 2019, I took steps to reach out to Paul Arend (Producer/Mixer/Worship Leader) about recording and producing an EP. I reached out to him specifically because of the years of worship leading and mixing experience he's had at Bethel Church and Vineyard Anaheim. We are currently in the process of refining and arranging songs. At the moment, we have scheduled a tentative recording date in August, 2019. </p>
<p>I believe the labor of songwriting for many years has produced fruit that is ready to be released. I am not looking to quit my day-job or become ""known"" but simply wanting to use the creativity that God has placed in me to lead people into worshipping Christ deeper. After all, our gifts from the Lord are meant to be used, not buried. Recorded music is the way people listen to worship music the majority of time, so I think its time to steward the vision God has given me and jump into the process of recording an EP.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading so far, and I hope that you will consider partnering with me by pre-ordering the EP and contributing to this project. I've prayed about recording for many years now and I feel that God has made it clear to me that the time is now for me to pursue it--regardless of how much I am able to raise. I will be taking a step of faith in order to pursue this, so EVERY dollar helps!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a team of students from various backgrounds, including two Taiwanese girls that are passionate about culture and arts, and who found in Paris a lot of curiosity about their culture.</p>
<p>We decided together to organise an high standard event with different aspects to let Paris know about Taiwanese culture and its sophistication.</p>
<p>Here is our team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lin Huang, former cultural event organizer of NewArt Foundation (Taiwan) and our artistic director.</li>
<li>Juno Chao, former intern at Tadao Ando museum (Taiwan) and our administrative director.</li>
<li>Lauriane Paulhiac, current intern at Agence Profile, former employee of Pole to Win Europe and our marketing and communication director.</li>
<li>Eddie Vann, who participated many event related project previously.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>How much would you pay for good sax?</p>
<p>What would you do if I could show you, not only how to legally pay for good sax, but to also get incredible incentives on top of it?</p>
<p>If there were a possibility of your body resonating afterwards, would you do it?</p>
<p>With all the stressful day-to-day news and activities we are all experiencing, there’s nothing like coming home to have good sax waiting for you. We as vibrational beings can benefit from a vibrational retuning of our body mind and spirit.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION) </i></p>
<p>This is why I always desired to create a project such as this. As a saxophonist and producer, I wanted to not just rerecord Aaliyah’s music but to arrange them using different styles while keeping the integrity of the original composition. The mission or purpose of this recording is to emanate Love, Healing and good vibrations in the world. You will walk away feeling positive and resonating with the intentions that created the music.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the more immediate need for funds. There are other needs and obstacles afterwards, as far as promoting, but this is the first major hurdle that we need to get over ASAP to meet the deadline. </p>
<p>1. Recording sessions (paying engineers, artists and musicians) = $2000</p>
<p>2. Mixing and Mastering = $3000 (by Mike Parlett of Talent Records in L.A.)</p>
<p>3. CD Manufacturing = $2000 (initial order from discmakers)</p>
<p>4. Graphic Design = $500 (for cd jacket, insert, and promotions)</p>
<p>5. Photo Shoot = $400 (For promotions)</p>
<p>6. Licensing= $1100 (Mechanical licensing for permission to record cover songs)</p>
<p>Total= $9,000</p>
<p>By helping us with your contributions you will receive the music before it is released, access to behind the scenes of finishing up the recording, free merchandise, free unreleased material, a personal look under the hood to see how it is being created, as well as other great incentives.</p>
<p>If there is the unlikeliness of not reaching our goal, the funds raised will go to the recording and mixing and mastering portion because that is the most important.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The success of this project with your help will allow me to do more important works in the future. I have so many other ideas that are going to be monumental but the only thing in the way of making them happen is the capital to get it done. I believe it takes ideas to make money, not necessarily money to make money. With the power of numbers (all of us), we can ""get 'er done!"" (in the voice of Larry The Cable Guy)</p>
<p>With 9 independent records under my belt, I know what it takes to complete a project and every project I have done has gotten only better and better. I have always wanted to have a way to interact and work directly with my fans and supporters with my past projects. This platform is that interface to connect us. I only wish I had this platform in the past for my other recordings. Here is our chance to work together and collaborate on the first of many projects in the future! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The major risks and challenges for this campaign frankly are just not being able to get the word out quickly enough so that people are aware of it, meeting all the deadlines in time, and being able to complete the rest of the recordings. This is one of the busiest times of the year for me so being able to organize my time and coordinate with other busy people will be challenging. Sometimes trying to bring musicians together is like trying to herd cats together. Lol But fortunately, 80% of the material is complete already and we are down to the last 20% stretch. So it shouldn't be too bad to get everything complete in time.  </p>
<p>I have always been good at organizing my time and planning things in detail. I think it's because I'm a very involved dad of 2 girls, the middle child of 6 kids and a Libra. ;o) I like and need balance and structure.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There is no amount that is too small. Please share this with as many people as you can. Thank you soooo much, to those that have already joined us! I need for everyone to blast this out to everyone you know! Don't fret not being able to directly contribute to this campaign. It is invaluable for you to share this to people you know. Use the link(s) that got you here and that is listed on this site. Lets work together and do our part to help bring peace, Love and harmony back into the world we live in.</p>

<p>Every now and then, a songwriter is gifted by their subconscious — or perhaps even a higher, more mysterious power — with a song in a dream. It might be just a fragment: a key line or chorus, a snatch of melody that lingers through the fog of waking up, or perhaps even a world-shaking riff on the order of ""Satisfaction."" Dustin Welch can attest to the phenomenon himself, having been blessed with not just a couple of legitimate ""dream songs"" over the years, but something on a far grander scale. Once upon a time, he dreamed a whole sound.</p>
<p>""It was profound,"" he would recall years later, ""and I'd never heard anything like it."" It was a chaotic but surreally harmonious maelstrom of ramshackle folk, stomping blues, gypsy jazz and driving rock that was gritty, raw, and archaic but also somehow futuristic, like a steampunk chamber orchestra playing a backwoods hootenanny or a post-apocalypse dive-bar. He didn't just hear that sound, either; it was a full-sensory experience that he could see and feel too, ""like horses running wild."" </p>
<p>Welch would spend the better part of his teens and early 20s chasing that sound/vision before finally cornering it on his 2009 debut, Whisky Priest — but he knew from the very start of that project that one album alone would not be enough to corral its full sonic and thematic scope. It demanded, at the very least, a trilogy. And time: time for each of the songs to reveal themselves in full, unforced, and find their own alignment in the cycle, and time for the songwriter himself to continue to grow along the way. Thus it would be four years before Welch delivered the second chapter (2013's Tijuana Bible), and another six years after that before bringing the trilogy to its proper close. Not, as he'd originally predicted, before the altar of some church (be it sacred or profane), but rather full circle to a stage where art — and dreams — often as not don't end, but begin. </p>
<p>Welcome to Dustin Welch's Amateur Theater. </p>
<p>""I just thought the theater was more appropriate than a church,"" he explains with a grin, ""and I kind like the chaos of the amateur theater in particular. But I also like the implied freshness of it, too. There's a line in the song 'Poster Child': 'The entire audience suffocates on opening night.' I like the idea of it being opening night ... again, where it all becomes new again, reborn.""</p>
<p>That there's also more than a hint of devilish mischief and outright menace in that same line of course goes without saying; going all the way back to ""One False Move,"" the bracing opening track on Whisky Priest, the entire trilogy has been fraught with a palpable sense of danger and adversity at every turn. But through all that darkness there's always been a thread of hope, too: either running parallel to the despair, just beneath the surface, or dangled just out of reach like the proverbial carrot. At its bleakest, Amateur Theater at times feels even more harrowing than either of its two predecessors. But it's also the light at the end of a tunnel and, true to classical form, a sort of homecoming. </p>
<p>""It's the Hero's Journey,"" explains Welch, a voracious reader and student of literature, philosophy, and history who could spend an entire evening discussing Joseph Campbell and mono-mythic theory as happily as he could swapping songs anywhere from Austin to Amsterdam. Needless to say, he knows his Dante, too. </p>
<p>""It's pretty loose,"" Welch says of his trilogy's debt to Alighieri's Divine Comedy, ""but I was definitely conscious of it, as far as the first record being the descent into hell, the second one being purgatory, and this one being sort of the redemption. And in a lot of ways it sort of resembles my own life and what I was going through at the time. But the character in all of these songs is really just that archetype of anybody that is looking for truth, looking for some kind of value and redemption for the soul. In any kind of mythology, you establish the struggle and conflict, and how does that resolve itself? By holding onto by some kind of faith. That's the little glimmer of hope that I keep striving for, and I feel like by the end of Amateur Theater, this character has finally achieved that. You've come out on the other side, and that's where the character becomes the hero.""</p>
<p>Of course, none of this mono-mythic ""hero"" talk would matter if the actual songs didn't hold up. But from the fearsome opening salvo of ""Stick to the Facts,"" a swaggering tall-tail wagger boasting ""the means to take your dreams and tear them all apart / or turn an empty canvas to a priceless piece of art,"" straight through to the redemptive closing prayer of ""Far Horizon,"" Amateur Theater is more than ""just"" the triumphant culmination of a decade-long trilogy; it's a compelling document of a years-in-the-making epic journey unto itself. The earliest tracks were recorded back in 2014 at a state-of-the-art studio in Copenhagen, where Dustin and his father, renowned Americana singer-songwriter Kevin Welch, had originally planned to work on a different project entirely, using many of the ace Danish musician featured on Kevin's 2002 album, Millionaire. Unfortunately, almost as soon as they got there, Kevin ended up laid out with three herniated discs in his neck. Having travelled halfway around the world and already booked the studio for a full week, though, they decided to make the best out of a bad situation. </p>
<p>""We were able to cut a couple of songs with my dad at the beginning, but after it got to where he couldn't even play, most of the week just ended up being my session,"" says Dustin. ""We had this fantastic band come in, and we cut like 16 songs in five days. Those guys were incredible — you could throw anything at them! A lot of the songs we got were first takes.""</p>
<p>As productive as that first session in Denmark was, though, Welch still had a long way to go after returning home to Texas. Additional recording and post-production would be done piecemeal, as funds and scheduling allowed, over the next four years at various friends' studios in and around Austin, Nashville, and Norman, Oklahoma. All the while Welch continued to write, fine tuning new songs and revisiting others he'd long held in reserve, including ""Dresden Snow,"" a co-write with Cary Ann Hurst of Shovels and Rope and Bill Carson. That one, inspired by the 2005 Jonathan Safran Foer novel Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, actually dates all the way back to the early days of Whisky Priest. ""We wrote it the same day that we wrote [Whisky Priest's] 'Don't Tell 'Em Nothin',' but I knew it just wasn't the time for that song yet,"" Welch says. ""I was always thinking in terms of the big picture, thematically."" </p>
<p>Other co-writing friends featured on Amateur Theater, many of whom also play or sing on the record, include John Fullbright, John Hadley, Javi Garcia, Jamie Lin Wilson, Jeremiah Nelson, Jeremy Nail, Mark Germino, Scotty Melton, and Chris Luedeke. Welch also wrote three songs with his dad, each an undeniable highlight: the aforementioned ""Far Horizon,"" written during two of their tours together, a year apart, in Australia; the sobering ""Man of Stone,"" which originated as a poem Kevin wrote about a fan who'd committed suicide; and the life-affirming ""After the Music"" — inspired by an elderly couple Dustin witnessed waltzing together, sans music, in the middle of an empty Texas dancehall while he was packing up his gear after a show. </p>
<p>Welch never actually mentions that incident in the song, let alone his believe that the couple he saw might well have been ghosts, but the beauty of the moment shook him to the soul — every bit as much as the harrowing stories of war and PTSD that he's heard first hand from the veterans he's worked with over the years through his songwriting-as-therapy program, Soldiers Songs and Voices. Their experiences aren't his own, but they're all very much a part of the ""big picture"" that he's devoted the last decade of his life and art to framing. ""It's all about survival,"" he offers. ""The whole album — the whole trilogy — is really about going through all hell, but knowing that you've got to be able to press through, to keep that hope and faith, and come back home.""</p>
<p>Welcome home, then, to Amateur Theater. Where it's opening night ... again — and time for the restless hero's journey to be born anew. </p>
<p>""To be honest, I have no idea yet where I'll go from here, but after being tied to this one thing for so long, now that it's done, I feel sort of set loose."" says Welch. ""What that means exactly, I don't know — but I do think the next record's going to be a whole different deal.""</p>

<h2><strong>About ""Unyielding""</strong></h2>
<p>We are Eternity's End, an international power metal band with neoclassical and speed metal influences, featuring former and current members of Necrophagist, Symphony X, Hibria, First Fragment and Alkaloid. The band was founded in 2014 and we released our debut album ""The Fire Within"" through Power Prog records in 2016. The album was very well received by both medias and critics alike. Unfortunately, the band's label went out of business in late 2016.</p>
<p>Shortly after the release of The Fire Within, we started writing songs for our second album titled ""Unyielding"". We are currently in the recording process. The album will be mixed and mastered by Piet Sielck (Iron Savior, Savage Circus) at Powerhouse Studios in Hamburg, starting in the last week of August. Piet and his team will also provide the choirs and backing vocals for the album.</p>
<p>The line up for Unyielding consists of:</p>
<p>Iuri Sanson - vocals</p>
<p>Christian Muenzner - lead&amp;rhythm guitars</p>
<p>Phil Tougas - lead&amp;rhythm guitars</p>
<p>Jimmy Pitts - keyboards</p>
<p>Mike LePond - Bass</p>
<p>Hannes Grossmann - Drums</p>
<p>The album will contain 10 songs, with a playtime of over 50 minutes of truly uncompromising, over the top power metal, with a strong emphasis on virtuoso musicianship, attitude and catchy-ness, in a unique combination of German, American and Japanese power metal influences mixed with Japanese SNES soundtracks. Very aggressive riffing, straight forward song structures, neoclassical chord progressions, triple lead trade offs and harmonies between 2 guitarists and a keyboardist, very memorable choruses, big, epic choirs and some of the most over the top classic metal vocals ever delivered by Iuri Sanson (ex Hibria) are the cornerstones of the music on our 2nd album. Despite the focus on over the top musicianship the entire album remains very catchy and memorable. What we feel sets Unyielding apart from the majority of other contemporary power metal releases is the aggression, passion and relentless-ness that got lost in the genre, the focus on aggressive, speedy riffs and dynamic performances by all members involved, allowing each member to put their own individual stamp on the music instead of producing a ""pop metal"" album.</p>
<p>A crowd funding campaign with the direct involvement of the fans is the best and only way for us to finance a production which we feel does the songs justice. We want to give the album the best sound and performance possible, therefore we need a budget for a proper, time consuming mix and master and to pay studio time for drum, bass, vocal and choir recordings. We also want to give the album the best possible design and will pay for the artwork ourselves through the funds generated from this campaign.</p>
<p>After the production is finished, we will try to license the album to different companies for distribution in different territories of the world. But in the days of constantly declining record sales and an over crowded market no record label in that genre of music will be able to pay a recording advance that will cover the expenses of the production.</p>
<p>An album like that is always a labor of love and not intended for personal enrichment, but also a very time consuming undertaking for everyone involved and which also bares a big financial risk. By contributing to this campaign, you can help us to cover the costs for the production and minimize the financial risk for us. Therefore, you are guaranteed to receive a high quality product.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The costs for the production process will include:</p>
<p>- mix and master of the album</p>
<p>- studio time for vocal, backing vocal, choir, guitar, drum and bass recordings, engineering, editing and re-amping</p>
<p>- the cover artwork and 16 page booklet</p>
<p>In this campaign you can pre-order  a physical copy of the album in CD version or a digital download, estimated delivery will be the first week of December. You can also order different 2 CD or 3 CD bundles.</p>
<p>We also offer the Guitar Pro Files for all the songs from The Fire Within and Unyielding. Please specify in your order if you want to receive the files in Guitar Pro 5, 6 or 7 format.</p>
<p>You also get the chance to have either Christian, Phil or Jimmy play a solo on your band's album, demo, single or video.</p>
<p>You can also get an individual Skype lesson with guitarist Christian Muenzner on guitar technique, harmony&amp;theory, improvisation, songwriting/composition/arrangement, fretboard knowledge, music business insights etc.</p>

<h2>about me (Karin Plato)</h2>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>I am a <strong>Vancouver</strong> based <strong>independent recording artist,  jazz vocalist, composer </strong>and <strong>arranger</strong> and I've jumped in the deep end (so to speak) and recorded a brand new recording of mostly originals along with a few other tunes that I really love and connect with. <strong>THIS COULD BE THE ONE</strong> will be released on CD and on vinyl this September.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>I feel lucky to be able to work with some of the very best jazz musicians in Vancouver: pianist <strong>Chris Gestrin</strong>, clarinetist <strong>James Danderfer</strong>, bassist <strong>Laurence Mollerup</strong> &amp;  drummer <strong>Joe Poole</strong>  <i><strong>YES! </strong></i> Each of these gents put their heart and soul into this recording with me. The guest artists involved in the project were the icing on my <i>""music cake""  </i>The guests: vocalists <strong>Jim Byrnes, Rebecca Shoichet,</strong> and trombonist<strong> Rod Murray </strong>again<strong> </strong><strong>YES!</strong>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Although this is a <strong>DIY project</strong> there have been many sizable expenses along the way!

<h3>Perks &amp; Pledges re: Karin's campaign</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>I've created some <strong>unique perks</strong> which I hope will entice potential supporters. Most of these perks are related to the music recorded and the graphic art we used for the CD and vinyl packaging.  The sketched character <strong>BO</strong> is a big part of the graphics work. My husband and artist <strong>Gorm Damborg</strong> sketched and created this character for me. In Danish the name <strong>BO</strong> means ""to live"" and thematically the music is about experiences many of us will have in our own lifetimes.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>There are <strong>exclusive perks </strong>such as hosting a house concert in your own home (some stipulations apply) and there are other perhaps <strong>more affordable perks</strong> including calendars, lyric booklets and more. There's also the <strong>VIP perk package</strong> which includes VIP tickets to one of 2 special album release concerts. These perks allow you to get something in addition to the music, either for yourself or, as gifts for others while in turn you'll be helping with this campaign. A signed CD is included with most perks.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Regarding what your money will support at this stage: <strong>Your pledges </strong>will help cover musician fees for album release concerts, Graphic artist fees and promotional fees beyond what I am able to cover on my own. There are certainly other areas where money raised in this campaign will help and I'll try to be transparent along the way with updates as the weeks progress.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>about the recording ""THIS COULD BE THE ONE""</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Regarding this new recording I can tell you that it is the result of almost 10 years of singing, playing, composing, performing, learning, improving and arranging music. Time has passed and like everyone else, much has happened and I believe that is reflected in the music. I know that no one in particular is actually ""waiting"" for my music but as an artist it is something I am compelled to do: to create, to be creative and to work on this art with passion and honesty. I get excited listening to how my fellow musicians sound on the recording. <strong>This record is authentic and filled with beautiful heart. Truly!</strong>
</li></ul>
<h2><strong>FINALLY...</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<ul><li>Some potential fans do not have the means to get involved financially and that I can completely understand and respect that. <strong>I'd certainly be grateful for any help getting the word out</strong> about the new recording, this campaign and the September concerts. Sharing the information with friends via word of mouth or email or via social media will be a big help too. Thank you all!</li></ul>

<h3>Help Spha record her debut album</h3>
<p>My name is Spha Mdlalose, I'm a South African singer/ songwriter and band leader. I also host my own jazz show on an online radio station called TransAfrica Radio.</p>
<p>I started recording my debut album two years ago and I need your help to complete the rest of the project. The funds raised from this campaign will assist me with recording costs such as booking studio time, mixing, mastering, C.D printing and a range of other relevant project related costs.</p>
<p>The album will consist of mostly original material that is influenced by jazz, soul and a variety of African sounds. </p>
<p>I'm very excited about the prospect of sharing this personal and musical journey with you and hope that you will enjoy the completed offering!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How much?</h3>
<p>I need a total of $ 9 000 to be able to complete the project in the way that I have envisioned. This amount will cover:</p>
<p>Booking studio time</p>
<p>Mixing and Mastering</p>
<p>C.d Printing</p>
<p>PR and advertising</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To inject a bit of excitement into our budding ""partnership""I will be offering fun perks namely: </p>
<p>5 x 1 hour vocal lessons that you can use for yourself, or for friends  and  family as a gift.</p>
<p>4 x comps for the album launch to the first four campaign contributors.</p>

<p>In the event that I do not reach the goal of $ 9000, the donated funds will still used for the album.</p>
</div><div>
<p>With this being my debut album, this project is a culmination of a life long dream and your contributions will be crucial in helping me realise this dream. I have always believed in the ability of music to convey emotions, thoughts and messages that cannot otherwise be easily articulated. In this way music has always been a place of solace, a  liberating experience and something that brings sheer joy and happiness to many the world over.This is how I hope the world will experience my musical offering. </p>

<p>Financial constraints, </p>
<p>Inadequate opportunities to share and/or perform the music </p>
<p>My sheer determination and absolute love for what i do will go a long way in helping me overcome these challenges. My plan is to take the music to spaces that are not known as conventional music performance spaces, in this way the music can have a broader audience reach and stimulate performance demand. </p>
<p>I have also built up a significant amount of goodwill and a good network in the music industry, this will go a long way in assisting me to see the completion and release of this project.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
This compilation will only be available through the indiegogo campaign.  It will not be available through streaming platforms or any other music sales service.

We are looking to secure enough pre-orders to fund $1,200 for the initial run and to cover the cost of licenses for the release and production of art and CDs.
We are offering digital downloads as well as 4 panel digipak CD
If we don't reach our goal, we will still produce the compilation in the quantity we have funds to cover.
Our goal is to release the album on President's Day, February 18th, 2019


The Impact you will have
Protests are about making our world better.  That's no exception here.  The proceeds from the sale of this release will be given to The Family Tree, which helps victims of Domestic Violence, Homelessness and Child Abuse & Neglect.

Risks & Challenges
The bands have about two months to finish up their cover song and get it to us. They are all professionals and we are confident we will stay on schedule.

<h3>Hi! I'm Stephen Webb and I have a story to share.</h3>
<p>Through many years of struggling with my faith, struggling to cling to hope, and remembering I am worthy and have always been loved I have come to a place where I believe God is asking me to start sharing my heart and creativity for Him.</p>
<p>In about 3 weeks I plan to spread a Christmas message of <i>Hope, Healing, and Mystery</i> through a unique arrangement of the classic carol ""Oh Holy Night<i>""</i> set to a moving and emotional music video. <u><strong><i>I am asking for partners to help that happen!</i></strong></u></p>
<p>There is so much that Christmas is all about to us in our modern society. Sometimes the reason we celebrate gets confused or forgotten. I hope to share what Christmas means to me and share it with as many people as possible while giving God the glory for what He did for us all. </p>
<p>I don't know what God wants to come of this, but I do know that He has placed this on my heart and if only one person is touched or healed in some way then I know it was worth it. <strong>I hope you choose be a part of that!</strong></p>
<h3>I am seeking only $3,500 to start!</h3>
<p>This amount will <b>completely</b> cover the cost of the professional audio recording and the production of the music video. If you know anything about the music industry you'll know this is <i>A STEAL</i> and hard to believe. Any extra funds will be used to make the video even better, more dynamic, and help curb marketing costs!</p>
<p>Contribute $5 and get an advanced download of the track.</p>
<p>Contribute $50 and you'll get a special thanks in the credits of the music video!</p>
<p>Contribute $100 and get a special video thanks with me singing a song for you!</p>
<p>Contribute $1000 and get a private performance of Oh Holy Night and select carols in your home for family and friends. <i>(If not local to Salt Lake City must have 2 weeks advanced scheduling. If Christmas doesn't work we'll find some other songs for a later to do to perform for you!)</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The exciting part is that this project has the potential for global impact!</h3>
<p>As you know when Christmas time comes around videos and songs get shared like crazy when everyone is in the Christmas spirit. My hope and vision is that all those who contribute and even those that can't will share this to all of their friends and family on social media, email, word of mouth, carrier pigeon, owl, you name it... </p>
<p><strong>The more people reached in this world the more impact this music and story has the potential to make. </strong></p>
</div><div><p>I really hope you enjoy the music, the video, and the story. I pray it touches you and inspires you to reach deep within and discover the gifts God has given.

<h3>The Project </h3>
<p>The finished product will be a professionally recorded and produced <strong>5 song album (EP)</strong> made here in Nashville. The album should be available by September 2019, if not sooner, in both digital and hard copy (CD) formats.  </p>
<p><strong>STEP 1 (completed)</strong></p>
<p>This project started several years ago as I began to develop and discover my own unique voice as a singer/songwriter. I am so passionate about what I have created, and I believe the five songs I have chosen for the studio are ready for the next step.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2 (completed)</strong></p>
<p>Having good songs comes first, but putting them in the hands of the right producer is not only the next move but extremely important to the integrity of the music.</p>
<p>Through months of searching and networking here in Music City, I have met many great and talented producers. However, it was just recently that I connected with the perfect producer and studio for this project. His name is Misa, and his team includes Ryan (a sound engineering genius) plus an awesome group of world-class session musicians. </p>
<p>I know these guys will get the vibe just right. Btw, if you follow along on the journey, I will introduce them to you! Now, that leads us to...</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3</strong></p>
<p><b>This step is the BIGGEST one of all and why I need your help. </b>Step three is the actual recording process, which entails far more than just recording. After the recording is done, including my vocal parts, there is still much work left to do in the studio to get the songs<i> </i>sounding and feeling juuuuust right. And juuuuust right costs a few $$$.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4</strong></p>
<p>After all the songs are recorded, mixed and mastered, they will need to be properly distributed and promoted. Although this can take a while, I am already making some strategical moves in advance so that I can release the songs at the <i>right</i> time. Staying on schedule is key here.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Eliza and I go by the artist alias E-Turn (FKA Eternity). I'm a singer and an MC based in Orlando, FL and I've been performing for close to 15 years now. I've known since I was a kid that music was my calling. For as long as I can remember, my voice and my words have been a bridge to self-expression. My parents told me a story that always stuck with me. When I was 2 years old, I had a febrile seizure and was taken to the hospital. They treated me and I fell asleep. As soon as I woke up, I started happily singing, as if nothing happened. This story sticks with me and is one of the thoughts that come into my head when hurdles hit my path. Fast forward, I have been part of a creative collective based in Orlando called ""Second Subject"" for about 8 years now and it has been such a blessing to my creative journey. The artists involved have pushed me to be better, off their talent alone. My crew eventually afforded me the connection to Fake Four and now, I am feeling more hopeful about my career than I ever have. I feel like when you're writing a ""short"" summary, it can be difficult to capture the whole journey and it almost makes it sound easy. Like, ""this happened, then this, then..voila!"" Let me just tell you, this has been so damn far from easy. I have put in countless hours, to the point that I had to check myself and make sure I was taking care of myself properly because my health was declining. I see my progress but it is a slow and taxing process. That's why many people give up. They burn out. It is a ruthless endeavor. But I'm still here and I understand how important it is for me to NOT give up. I'm about to embark on my first European tour in March and I am so incredibly grateful. Being that it's my first official tour out there, I'm not making big bucks. By funding this project, you will not only help bring the record to life, you will help me sustain myself on the road so I can continue share this album with people all over the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $3500. There are a ton of cool perks you can choose from and a bunch of different bundle varieties. There are also exclusive items that will only be available through this Indiegogo. Be one of the first to own Young World on vinyl, but not just regular ol' vinyl...a dope ass 12"" picture disc! </p>
<p>NOTE: All perks that include vinyl will come with the same vinyl. Different photos are simply to show different angles of the record. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I discussed some of the impact earlier but what's more, I feel like Young World has the potential to raise standards for women in Hip Hop and by expanding it's platform, we continue to solidify it's stance. By backing this project, you not only get to experience the record through such a classic listening medium, you are also supporting the roots of our culture, supporting the evolution of our culture, as well as supporting an indie label and artist who devote their lives to this. You are so important to keeping us going. And at the end of the day, you help my artistry thrive, which can ultimately help others to thrive.</p>
