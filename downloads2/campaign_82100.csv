I channel my Love and Truth to Hip-Hop beats - sharing great perspective and insight into ourselves and the world. Earth is going through some serious changes right now and I am using my art to heal our people and planet. Offering a new perspective could just be the medicine this world needs. A quick BIO on me:</p>
<p>~In 2012, the old me died. I was reborn and began seeking answers to the most fundamental questions of Life; namely my Purpose. </p>
<p>~In 2013, I graduated from Texas A&amp;M University with my Master's in Entrepreneurship. I rejected the 8-5 corporate world, knowing my talents could be better used to serve this planet. </p>
<p>~I spent 2 years intensively studying 'spirituality' and other metaphysical concepts. </p>
<p>~In 2014, I began channeling my learnings and Love to Hip-Hop beats. Select recordings are available to <a href=""www.soundcloud.com/ross-deotte"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stream for FREE here.</a> I connected with many other conscious rappers from across the country and joined Extra Terrestrial Alience: a hip-hop group dedicated to bringing higher-levels of consciousness to Earth. I am fortunate to have produced an EP with this group called  Mind Gems, which is available for FREE to <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Extra-Terrestrial-Alience-Mind-Gems-Ep-mixtape.713190.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">download here. </a> </p>
<p>~In 2015, I wrote and published my first Album: Welcome to the World Of Wizarding.  This leads us to now.</p>
<p>I am seeking financial support to publish and promote this conscious work of art on outlets such as iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, Google Play, Amazon, and many others. This is to spread Light, Love, and awareness to our people. </p>
<p>Side note: I live on and manage a <a href=""www.goodearthorganicfarm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">175-acre Organic Farm</a>, which feeds hundreds of people with some of the highest quality produce that Dollars can buy.

<br/><p></p>“He’s the painter, I’m the canvas.” Carlos Devone embodies this. Over the past 25 years, God has been faithfully creating a man useful to love and build up his people.<br/>It started in Jacksonville, Florida as the 90’s opened. Carlos grew up, as too many of us do, in a broken home, the father skipping out before the son could process his presence and absence. Carlos’ mother remarried, but domestic violence came hand in hand with the wedding vows.<br/><br/>So Carlos Devone turned to sports, finding some success as a running back. Football and school took him to Grinnell College in Iowa, famous for its progressive and top-tier academics. Ironically, it was at this proudly secular school that God grabbed Carlos. After injuries killed his football career, he started focusing on music as a way to express what was going on in his life, and it was natural that his music focuses on sharing the love and forgiveness that Christ had given him. He began recording and has since released 9 projects.<br/><br/>Having recorded and released nearly 150 tracks, Carlos Devone has developed his sound and is focused on broadening his fan base and laying the groundwork for the future. Carlos is bringing a southern hip-hop sound paired with influences from across the musical spectrum, from reggae to rock, and any other sound that reaches him.

<div>Simply put, because we all want to be happy and happiness and joy drive so many of our decisions in life. Yet, when I survey the landscape and even my heart, there are so many things competing for our affections.

<div><span><h3>Hey FeldFanFam Welcome 2 The ""Elev8or 2 Ascension"" Fund Raiser Page!</h3>
<p>WELCOME!</p>
<p>Thank U 4 stopping by 2 check out my campaign. Here's what's going on:</p>
<p>I know the questions most of U must be thinking right now...questions like...Why have I brought U here? What is this all about? And most importantly Y would a Movie Star like U be asking us 4 $? Dont U have your own $? And Y R U asking us 2 help when U R already successful. Let me do my best 2 answer those questions.</p>
<p>#1. Yes I have been fortunate 2 keep myself steadily working as an actor 4 many decades. </p>
<p>#2 Yes I have had some success in my career.</p>
<p>However as U probably know making films is my bread &amp; butter, it is how I earn a living. It is my means 2 an end as it were....</p>
<p>Music however is my Love, my Passion, my Heart &amp; soul. Music is the thing I feel I was truly meant 2 do, had my parents not made the choice 2 throw me in front of cameras at the tender age of 3, &amp; kept me there 2 earn a living &amp; financially support my family until I was legally emancipated at the age of 15.</p>
<p> Acting was NOT my 1st choice. Nor was it my choice at all. However, I have grown 2 LOVE it. Acting is now as much a part of my being as breathing, eating, or drinking. I have been programmed that way. It was inevitable &amp; unavoidable.</p>
<p>But locked deep inside &amp; lying dormant 4 many years, was a burning passion 2 create music! I love writing songs, and I love expressing myself through music. I love producing interesting sounds &amp; creating original beats. I love writing my innermost personal feelings into a  catchy jingle that people can instantly relate 2, &amp; find themselves singing along with. And most of all, I LOVE performing! I love going out on that stage &amp; coming alive with the lights, &amp; the roar of the crowd. I LOVE making the audience scream n shout, &amp; dance the night away. I LOVE the togetherness that can only happen from a LIVE musical experience.</p>
<p>However unfortunate as it was, once I was established as an actor, I found it increasingly harder 4 anybody 2 give my music a chance. Although I started songwriting at 13, &amp; began doing Live concerts at 15, I was not able 2 release my 1st album until I was 22 yrs old via a small indy label. No major  record company would take me seriously. I was never told ""The music stinks"" or ""I just don't hear it"", as typical turn downs from major labels go. No! Instead I got lots of weird excuses like ""The songs are catchy, but do U have 2 sing them""? or ""Not bad 4 an actor, but we don't feel U will have the time 2 dedicate 2 a music career"", I was blown off, laughed at, &amp; the doors were continuously slammed in my face. Never because of a lack of talent, but rather because of a prejudice, how could I succeed when so many others had tried before me and failed?</p>
<p>I became a statistic.With albums released by peers like John Travolta, Scott Baio, William Shatner, &amp; Alyssa Milano as examples, the idea of actors making music became laughable, and fell under the catergory of ""a joke"". That was it I was dead &amp; buried in the music industry before I started.</p>
<p>Fortunately I didnt let that stop my new album project. I have also toured America 4 times in total, twice w my band &amp; 2 solo tours. I have never stopped writing, recording, and performing my music 4 LIVE audiences. Because whenever we toured, U were there 2 C it!</p>
<p>However I have NEVER made music 4 financial gain. I have never become rich making music. In fact my last band album cost me $100,000 just 4 the production of the album, and due 2 lack of promotional &amp; marketing funds I made very little of it back. However it isnt about making $ 4 me, in fact its quite the opposite, I have spent and lost massive amounts of $ by continuing my music career. It is all about the LOVE and passion I derive from simply creating my music. U C  in all of this time I had never earned a commercial or mainstream hit.....UNTIL RECENTLY....</p>
<p>However, I might not have kept going, had nobody gotten it or appreciated it. But thats just it, my true fans who took the time 2 actually listen 2 what my music was saying, immediately fell in love with it. Actual Music critics (tabloids aside) have given consistent positive reviews. Friends &amp; peers have given me much strength &amp; support through positive feedback, but the number 1 thing that has kept me making music is the overwhelming amount of praise &amp; appreciation that I receive from U..THE FANS!</p>
<p>U R the reason I keep going. Your comments, your letters, your words of encouragement. U alone lift me up when I get weak, &amp; scared, &amp; think its just not worth it anymore. But then I do a concert &amp; look out &amp; C thousands of screaming fans, singing along 2 every word, just as I would while watching my favorite artists. Because of this I finally accepted there was an audience 4 what I do, &amp; it seems that audience has continued 2 grow through the years at a rapid pace. Now more than ever I find new fans commenting on age old recordings I thought were long since forgotten.</p>
<p>As many of U know, I have been hard at work 4 quite a while on my new album ""ANGELIC 2 THE CORE"".  This is not your average musical project. It is a labor of Love. It is the most imaginative, diverse, daring, creative, &amp; personal solo album I have made 2 date. This is a very important work 4 me, This album has literally taken a decade 2 create. I know that is an extraordinary amount of time 2 spend on 1 project, but once U hear the entire album U will understand Y.</p>
<div>""Angelic 2 the Core"" is my 1st ever double album. It has 22 songs on it. The album truly shows my diversity as a songwriter &amp; producer, covering all fields of the pop music spectrum. Part pop, part Rock, part EDM, part Hip Hop, and all soul, this album truly has something 4 EVERYBODY!<p></p>
<p>4 the 1st time in my musical career U will hear songs which were largely recorded privately in my Home Studio. It also happens 2 B the 1st time I have endeavored 2 play all of the instruments on many of the songs. So now U R probably thinking...Well if its done in your home and U R playing all the instruments, how come it took so long?? I will explain....</p>
<p>Yes it is a ""solo"" album, and yes I am a multi instrumentalist on many of the tracks....HOWEVER....this album is a culmination of a large cast of incredibly talented singers, songwriters, producers, musicians, rappers, and artists, coming together, 2 help me create this.</p>
<p>This album features 5 generations of Hip Hop artists including several legends of the art form. It also features some of the greatest vocalists, &amp; musicians of our time. Here is a list of some of the incredible people who were kind enough 2 dedicate their time, talents, &amp; energy 2 make this dream a reality:</p>
<p>Fred Durst (Limp Bizkit), Kaya Jones (Pussycat Dolls), R1ckone (Black Eyed Peas), Scott Page (Pink Floyd), B.Howard, Kurupt, Snoop Dogg, Doc Ice (Whodini/UTFO),Thomas Van Musser (Black Eyed Peas songwriter) Dave Dunn (Infectous Grooves)The Wizards (Production team) Jon Carin (Pink Floyd), Demario ""SB""( New Rap artist), Manny Mijaris (EDM Producer)Thomas Van Musser (writer for Black Eyed Peas), Jon Carin (Pink Floyd), Corey Haim (Film clips), Jameson Newlander (Film clips) Glasses Boys (EDM collective), Michael Debarge (Debarge), Truth Movement, Tommy Daugherty (Death Row recording engineer), Angel Courtney Anne aka DJAC, and of course  Coreys Angels (backing vocalists) plus many more...</p>
<p>In the 10 yrs I've been working on this album I have completely self funded this project 4 my very own label CiFi records.  I created CiFi 4 the purpose of releasing my music direct 2 U, without the financial aid, or creative influence of Big record company executives. I have done this album all on my own 2 insure that U will get 2 hear my vision directly. However after 10 years of financially backing this project, as I near the final stages of its completion, I have come 2 realize that although I have created a work that is sonically superior 2 all of my other solo projects, &amp; has many hit worthy songs, 1 thing is impendingly clear.....I have no budget left 4 Mastering, artwork, duplication, distribution, or marketing.</p>
<p>Now let me explain Y the last part can prevent me from ever getting this album released.</p>
<p>There R enormous costs in the process of making an album. From engineers, 2 instruments, from equipment 2 software, from computers, 2 hard drives, there R many costs that come along with running your own studio, espescially in a modern world where technology is constantly evolving. Constant software updates. Constant additions of plug ins and Pro Tools upgrades can be quite costly. In order 2 keep the music sounding fresh &amp; relevant, U must constantly upgrade &amp; change the sounds in every song 2 continue keeping up w the evolution of sound &amp; technology. An album that takes a decade, means every few years I have had 2 reopen the older songs and update certain sounds. In some cases I have had 2 completely rerecord the song because it has become dated, which wont work with a modern pop album. On top of all of that I have also had 2 pay 4 the release of every single (their have been 5 singles 2 date), the production of both music videos, &amp; the artwork 4 each of the singles, &amp; the distribution costs of each single &amp; the EP.</p>
<p>With all of that said, now that I have finally completed the production work on all 22 songs, I have started budgeting 4 the final stages of the process &amp; 2 my surprise the most expensive part has yet 2 come. </p>
<p>In the modern age of music, it is a very exciting time 4 independent artists like myself, because now 4 the 1st time in my career, I have been able 2 release singles 2 radio, create and release my own videos, &amp; make my music available 4 digital download all over the world by the push of a button. However 1 thing hasn't changed....</p>
<p>The complete domination of Big Corporations &amp; Big Record Labels who pay massive amounts of advertising $$ 2 propel their artists 2 the top of the Billboard charts. This is Y U rarely C a new artist break in2 the charts, Because the Big Labels have complete worldwide domination over radio. Companies like Clearchannel who own &amp; operate just about every top 40 station in the world, have a stronghold over the industry. Basically the only way 4 a little guy like me 2 B able 2 compete, &amp; actually make a dent, is 2 fight power with power. Which means fighting $ with $.</p>
<p>It seems almost impossible 4 a little known musical artist like me 2 get played on mainstream radio. ALMOST impossible....but not TOTALLY impossible. </p>
<p>U C the way it works is if a guy like me has the financial backing 2 pay 4 ads in music magazines, radio spots, &amp; radio station magazines like HITS, &amp;  with the right radio promotion team behind me, I can take out enough ads, &amp; make enough noise 2 get the musical directors of those stations 2 notice.</p>
<p>Now if I didnt think the songs had what it takes 2 B contemporary chart toppers, I wouldnt even try 2 compete. But lets take a look at the release of my singles so far &amp; their success rates. The 1st single &amp; video I released was ""Ascension Millennium"" as my 1st single 4 the album &amp; with my 1st video ever, I immediately gave the rights exclusively 2 MTV. It was a shot n the dark. But 2 my surprise the video garnished the coveted ""Buzzworthy"" status within the 1st 12 hrs of its release. By the end of 2 weeks it had earned a quarter million views on MTV giving it the claim of a video gone viral. </p>
<p>At that time I created &amp; launched my own YouTube channel. Within a months time the quarter million views jumped 2 a half a million. By the end of the 2nd month it had earned 750,000 views. Shortly thereafter my channel was taken down by the powers that be citing they had no confirmation that I was really me &amp; that my music was under my official license. When that happened I lost all of the views, &amp; monetary gain that should have been awarded by those views.</p>
<p>So I started over. I am happy 2 say that video is now back up 2 almost 300,000 views again. With well over a Million views worldwide we made such an impact that the video has now become that of legend, &amp; has been parodied, &amp; imitated many times over. It was even joked about last year in the final season of Glee.</p>
<p>The next video was released which was called DUH! However this time we released it exclusively 2 an internet channel called FilmOn where we created a Live talk show featuring myself as the host &amp; Angel Courtney (DJAC) as my cohost, &amp; eventually moved it 2 my YouTube channel, where it gained a quarter Million views as well. However I still hadn't attempted a radio push.</p>
<p>The next single I pushed even less, in fact I gave away ""Mercy"" feat B Howard 4 free. It was released over Easter weekend, &amp; as the song was spiritual in nature w a real Gospel choir I just didnt feel right charging the listener 4 the experience, &amp; I never released a video or released it as a radio single, something I would still like 2 do, as its such a terriffic song.</p>
<p>Finally with my next single ""Everybody"" feat Doc Ice I rolled the dice &amp; put some $ into radio promotions. With the small amount of capitol behind it ""Everybody"" climbed the independent, &amp; digital radio charts finally making its way 2 the #13 position in both the R&amp;B/Hip Hop &amp; Hot AC music charts. The song maintained the #13 spot 3 weeks in a row. It also climbed 2 the top 40 in the top 200 list. However the charts I climbed were the Digital Radio Tracker &amp; Top Adds charts, which R cool, but still not Cash Box or Billboard.</p>
<p>So with my next single ""Remember 222 (Corey's song) "" I pushed it even harder (meaning more ad dollars) &amp; with that I earned my 1st ever #1 Hit! The song climbed 2 the top of the indy charts on a Live streaming network called Lucky Star radio which can be heard from LA 2 Australia via the internet, It also gained the attention of the 2nd biggest chart in the world which is Cashbox &amp; made it all the way 2 #23 on that chart. But again still not enough 2 break Billboards top 200.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I have released some strong singles off the forthcoming album, but the best is yet 2 come. I have saved the best 4 NOW!</p>
<p>As I am finally finished w the album &amp; have so many incredible songs left 2 unveil, now is the most important part. I know from the track record I'm on my way 2 breaking into the Billboard charts, I BELIEVE with the right backing and financial support I have got what it takes 2 get my 1st official Billboard hit.</p>
<p>In the coming months it is my intention 2 finally cross over &amp; after 4 decades of recording music, I can finally make my biggest dream a reality &amp; get myself in the mainstream of contemporary pop music. I know that the next single I release can do it! The songs that I am set 2 release will be the most catchy, &amp; playable songs I have ever written &amp; recorded. Espescially with the powerful chart topping artists I have alligned myself with, I know this album can truly be a MONSTER! But the simple fact is I cant do this alone. I just dont have the resources that I need 2 make a run against the giant powerhouses that fuel the radio industry. Not without YOUR HELP!</p>
<p>So that is why I come 2 U, my most loyal fans, who have become my surrogate family. I never had a mother or father 2 support me. I never had a college fund. I never had family security. I never had someone 2 lean on or turn 2 when times got rough. So now in my hour of desperation, I must turn 2 the only support group, the only ""family"" I have ever know....THE FELDFAM! </p>
<p>I know with your help I can finally get my music out..... not just 2 U... but 2 millions of people who dont even know that Corey Feldman has records out. This is my only chance 2 get my music heard by the masses. Lets face it, I'm not getting any younger! In a few short years I wont have the stamina, or the physical ability 2 go out there &amp; create a LIVE experience, worthy of what U expect from me. When I put on a show, I give it 100%! I give U my all, my everything! With the success of this album I will launch the most incredible LIVE performance U can imagine. A 2 hr plus show, where I can sing all of the songs U have grown 2 LOVE through the years. </p>
<p>I will finally perform the songs from my past albums and films that Ive never been able 2 perform LIVE. I will be able 2 perform all the Movie soundtracks, the songs U know &amp; LOVE, &amp; of course many of the Amazing songs from the new album that U havent even heard yet. This tour will be the pinnacle of my live performances as a solo artist. As the album will become the 1 that puts my music on the map 4 the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I know I'm asking a lot. But what choice do I have? Its now or never! Do or Die! And as U know Goonies NEVER SAY DIE! So that leaves me only 1 option....2 DO IT!</p>
<p>So I come 2 U my ""Feldfam"" in my hour of need &amp; ask U 2 PLEASE CONTRIBUTE 2 help me FINALLY REALIZE my lifelong dreamof sharing my music with not just U but also with the rest of the world. So I can finally spread my message of PEACE &amp; LOVE through the joyous &amp; incredible movement of MUSIC! </p>
<p>I KNOW wholeheartedly that this album has really got what it takes 2 top the Billboard charts, &amp; the singles that I am preparing 2 release will be the MOST POWERFUL &amp; have the MOST POTENTIAL of any in my long career, with the help of some of todays greatest chart topping artists! This DREAM must become a REALITY but simply said I NEED U 2 STAND BY ME.....because..... Its OUR TIME!</p>

WELCOME!
Thank U 4 stopping by 2 check out my campaign. Here's what's going on:
I know the questions most of U must be thinking right now...questions like...Why have I brought U here? What is this all about? And most importantly Y would a Movie Star like U be asking us 4 $? Dont U have your own $? And Y R U asking us 2 help when U R already successful. Let me do my best 2 answer those questions.
#1. Yes I have been fortunate 2 keep myself steadily working as an actor 4 many decades. 
#2 Yes I have had some success in my career.
However as U probably know making films is my bread & butter, it is how I earn a living. It is my means 2 an end as it were....
Music however is my Love, my Passion, my Heart & soul. Music is the thing I feel I was truly meant 2 do, had my parents not made the choice 2 throw me in front of cameras at the tender age of 3, & kept me there 2 earn a living & financially support my family until I was legally emancipated at the age of 15.
 Acting was NOT my 1st choice. Nor was it my choice at all. However, I have grown 2 LOVE it. Acting is now as much a part of my being as breathing, eating, or drinking. I have been programmed that way. It was inevitable & unavoidable.
But locked deep inside & lying dormant 4 many years, was a burning passion 2 create music! I love writing songs, and I love expressing myself through music. I love producing interesting sounds & creating original beats. I love writing my innermost personal feelings into a  catchy jingle that people can instantly relate 2, & find themselves singing along with. And most of all, I LOVE performing! I love going out on that stage & coming alive with the lights, & the roar of the crowd. I LOVE making the audience scream n shout, & dance the night away. I LOVE the togetherness that can only happen from a LIVE musical experience.
However unfortunate as it was, once I was established as an actor, I found it increasingly harder 4 anybody 2 give my music a chance. Although I started songwriting at 13, & began doing Live concerts at 15, I was not able 2 release my 1st album until I was 22 yrs old via a small indy label. No major  record company would take me seriously. I was never told ""The music stinks"" or ""I just don't hear it"", as typical turn downs from major labels go. No! Instead I got lots of weird excuses like ""The songs are catchy, but do U have 2 sing them""? or ""Not bad 4 an actor, but we don't feel U will have the time 2 dedicate 2 a music career"", I was blown off, laughed at, & the doors were continuously slammed in my face. Never because of a lack of talent, but rather because of a prejudice, how could I succeed when so many others had tried before me and failed?
I became a statistic.With albums released by peers like John Travolta, Scott Baio, William Shatner, & Alyssa Milano as examples, the idea of actors making music became laughable, and fell under the catergory of ""a joke"". That was it I was dead & buried in the music industry before I started.
Fortunately I didnt let that stop my new album project. I have also toured America 4 times in total, twice w my band & 2 solo tours. I have never stopped writing, recording, and performing my music 4 LIVE audiences. Because whenever we toured, U were there 2 C it!
However I have NEVER made music 4 financial gain. I have never become rich making music. In fact my last band album cost me $100,000 just 4 the production of the album, and due 2 lack of promotional & marketing funds I made very little of it back. However it isnt about making $ 4 me, in fact its quite the opposite, I have spent and lost massive amounts of $ by continuing my music career. It is all about the LOVE and passion I derive from simply creating my music. U C  in all of this time I had never earned a commercial or mainstream hit.....UNTIL RECENTLY....
However, I might not have kept going, had nobody gotten it or appreciated it. But thats just it, my true fans who took the time 2 actually listen 2 what my music was saying, immediately fell in love with it. Actual Music critics (tabloids aside) have given consistent positive reviews. Friends & peers have given me much strength & support through positive feedback, but the number 1 thing that has kept me making music is the overwhelming amount of praise & appreciation that I receive from U..THE FANS!
U R the reason I keep going. Your comments, your letters, your words of encouragement. U alone lift me up when I get weak, & scared, & think its just not worth it anymore. But then I do a concert & look out & C thousands of screaming fans, singing along 2 every word, just as I would while watching my favorite artists. Because of this I finally accepted there was an audience 4 what I do, & it seems that audience has continued 2 grow through the years at a rapid pace. Now more than ever I find new fans commenting on age old recordings I thought were long since forgotten.
As many of U know, I have been hard at work 4 quite a while on my new album ""ANGELIC 2 THE CORE"".  This is not your average musical project. It is a labor of Love. It is the most imaginative, diverse, daring, creative, & personal solo album I have made 2 date. This is a very important work 4 me, This album has literally taken a decade 2 create. I know that is an extraordinary amount of time 2 spend on 1 project, but once U hear the entire album U will understand Y.
""Angelic 2 the Core"" is my 1st ever double album. It has 22 songs on it. The album truly shows my diversity as a songwriter & producer, covering all fields of the pop music spectrum. Part pop, part Rock, part EDM, part Hip Hop, and all soul, this album truly has something 4 EVERYBODY!
4 the 1st time in my musical career U will hear songs which were largely recorded privately in my Home Studio. It also happens 2 B the 1st time I have endeavored 2 play all of the instruments on many of the songs. So now U R probably thinking...Well if its done in your home and U R playing all the instruments, how come it took so long?? I will explain....
Yes it is a ""solo"" album, and yes I am a multi instrumentalist on many of the tracks....HOWEVER....this album is a culmination of a large cast of incredibly talented singers, songwriters, producers, musicians, rappers, and artists, coming together, 2 help me create this.
This album features 5 generations of Hip Hop artists including several legends of the art form. It also features some of the greatest vocalists, & musicians of our time. Here is a list of some of the incredible people who were kind enough 2 dedicate their time, talents, & energy 2 make this dream a reality:
Fred Durst (Limp Bizkit), Kaya Jones (Pussycat Dolls), R1ckone (Black Eyed Peas), Scott Page (Pink Floyd), B.Howard, Kurupt, Snoop Dogg, Doc Ice (Whodini/UTFO),Thomas Van Musser (Black Eyed Peas songwriter) Dave Dunn (Infectous Grooves)The Wizards (Production team) Jon Carin (Pink Floyd), Demario ""SB""( New Rap artist), Manny Mijaris (EDM Producer)Thomas Van Musser (writer for Black Eyed Peas), Jon Carin (Pink Floyd), Corey Haim (Film clips), Jameson Newlander (Film clips) Glasses Boys (EDM collective), Michael Debarge (Debarge), Truth Movement, Tommy Daugherty (Death Row recording engineer), Angel Courtney Anne aka DJAC, and of course  Coreys Angels (backing vocalists) plus many more...
In the 10 yrs I've been working on this album I have completely self funded this project 4 my very own label CiFi records.  I created CiFi 4 the purpose of releasing my music direct 2 U, without the financial aid, or creative influence of Big record company executives. I have done this album all on my own 2 insure that U will get 2 hear my vision directly. However after 10 years of financially backing this project, as I near the final stages of its completion, I have come 2 realize that although I have created a work that is sonically superior 2 all of my other solo projects, & has many hit worthy songs, 1 thing is impendingly clear.....I have no budget left 4 Mastering, artwork, duplication, distribution, or marketing.
Now let me explain Y the last part can prevent me from ever getting this album released.
There R enormous costs in the process of making an album. From engineers, 2 instruments, from equipment 2 software, from computers, 2 hard drives, there R many costs that come along with running your own studio, espescially in a modern world where technology is constantly evolving. Constant software updates. Constant additions of plug ins and Pro Tools upgrades can be quite costly. In order 2 keep the music sounding fresh & relevant, U must constantly upgrade & change the sounds in every song 2 continue keeping up w the evolution of sound & technology. An album that takes a decade, means every few years I have had 2 reopen the older songs and update certain sounds. In some cases I have had 2 completely rerecord the song because it has become dated, which wont work with a modern pop album. On top of all of that I have also had 2 pay 4 the release of every single (their have been 5 singles 2 date), the production of both music videos, & the artwork 4 each of the singles, & the distribution costs of each single & the EP.
With all of that said, now that I have finally completed the production work on all 22 songs, I have started budgeting 4 the final stages of the process & 2 my surprise the most expensive part has yet 2 come. 
In the modern age of music, it is a very exciting time 4 independent artists like myself, because now 4 the 1st time in my career, I have been able 2 release singles 2 radio, create and release my own videos, & make my music available 4 digital download all over the world by the push of a button. However 1 thing hasn't changed....
The complete domination of Big Corporations & Big Record Labels who pay massive amounts of advertising $$ 2 propel their artists 2 the top of the Billboard charts. This is Y U rarely C a new artist break in2 the charts, Because the Big Labels have complete worldwide domination over radio. Companies like Clearchannel who own & operate just about every top 40 station in the world, have a stronghold over the industry. Basically the only way 4 a little guy like me 2 B able 2 compete, & actually make a dent, is 2 fight power with power. Which means fighting $ with $.
It seems almost impossible 4 a little known musical artist like me 2 get played on mainstream radio. ALMOST impossible....but not TOTALLY impossible. 
U C the way it works is if a guy like me has the financial backing 2 pay 4 ads in music magazines, radio spots, & radio station magazines like HITS, &  with the right radio promotion team behind me, I can take out enough ads, & make enough noise 2 get the musical directors of those stations 2 notice.
Now if I didnt think the songs had what it takes 2 B contemporary chart toppers, I wouldnt even try 2 compete. But lets take a look at the release of my singles so far & their success rates. The 1st single & video I released was ""Ascension Millennium"" as my 1st single 4 the album & with my 1st video ever, I immediately gave the rights exclusively 2 MTV. It was a shot n the dark. But 2 my surprise the video garnished the coveted ""Buzzworthy"" status within the 1st 12 hrs of its release. By the end of 2 weeks it had earned a quarter million views on MTV giving it the claim of a video gone viral. 
At that time I created & launched my own YouTube channel. Within a months time the quarter million views jumped 2 a half a million. By the end of the 2nd month it had earned 750,000 views. Shortly thereafter my channel was taken down by the powers that be citing they had no confirmation that I was really me & that my music was under my official license. When that happened I lost all of the views, & monetary gain that should have been awarded by those views.
So I started over. I am happy 2 say that video is now back up 2 almost 300,000 views again. With well over a Million views worldwide we made such an impact that the video has now become that of legend, & has been parodied, & imitated many times over. It was even joked about last year in the final season of Glee.
The next video was released which was called DUH! However this time we released it exclusively 2 an internet channel called FilmOn where we created a Live talk show featuring myself as the host & Angel Courtney (DJAC) as my cohost, & eventually moved it 2 my YouTube channel, where it gained a quarter Million views as well. However I still hadn't attempted a radio push.

Finally with my next single ""Everybody"" feat Doc Ice I rolled the dice & put some $ into radio promotions. With the small amount of capitol behind it ""Everybody"" climbed the independent, & digital radio charts finally making its way 2 the #13 position in both the R&B/Hip Hop & Hot AC music charts. The song maintained the #13 spot 3 weeks in a row. It also climbed 2 the top 40 in the top 200 list. However the charts I climbed were the Digital Radio Tracker & Top Adds charts, which R cool, but still not Cash Box or Billboard.
So with my next single ""Remember 222 (Corey's song) "" I pushed it even harder (meaning more ad dollars) & with that I earned my 1st ever #1 Hit! The song climbed 2 the top of the indy charts on a Live streaming network called Lucky Star radio which can be heard from LA 2 Australia via the internet, It also gained the attention of the 2nd biggest chart in the world which is Cashbox & made it all the way 2 #23 on that chart. But again still not enough 2 break Billboards top 200.
With all of that said, I have released some strong singles off the forthcoming album, but the best is yet 2 come. I have saved the best 4 NOW!
As I am finally finished w the album & have so many incredible songs left 2 unveil, now is the most important part.

This DREAM must become a REALITY but simply said I NEED U 2 STAND BY ME.....because..... Its OUR TIME!

A mismatched group of creative, open minded individuals who have combined sounds to create an album that is so diverse it just might make you think. We want to share our art with you and the world. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our mission is this:</span></p>
<p>Art isn't always about what people WANT. Sometimes it's about what they NEED. We have created an album inspired by our daily lives, dirty thoughts, and a deep sense that there is more out there. We want people to listen to this album, and then get out and do something. We are on the brink of an enormous change in our society, but no one is talking about it. Somewhere in between particle accelerators, corporate government takeovers, lost loves, and globalization there is our future. We want to inspire you to start the conversation. </p>
<p>We have the album heres our challenge:</p>
<p>Before we can launch our album we have to break through a blockade: Advertising. If no one knows who we are we won't be able to get people talking. A basic campaign for a new band to advertise is around $10,000. That is our goal! If we meet our goal we will be able to advertise our music on various platforms such as social media, radio and television. </p>
<p>Its time for the perkilator: </p>
<p>There are some great perks we have for you guys!! We want to be honest with you, if you are looking for the best deal it is the $25 perk! If you are looking for more we have that as well. You can have us prank call one of your friends or have us be your b*#%&amp;es for a night and cook you dinner. Our main goal here though is to get the album in your hands so every perk comes with a digital copy of our CD! </p>
<p>Upon success of this campaign there are a few outcomes:</p>
<p>Chances are we could promote the album and it just isn't what people are looking for. Music and its industry can be as unpredictable as the weather so money alone isn't going to buy us success. </p>
<p>However, being able to reach out to markets outside of our normal fan base could help get us fans in areas we haven't been able to reach on our own. How can a brand new band draw an audience in an area it hasn't played before? This is a big catch 22 of the industry. If new groups of people see our ads and download our music there is potential we can have fans waiting for us in places we haven't been yet. Booking a tour would become much easier if there are venues that have already heard of us. </p>
<p>If you have already donated help give the campaign a boost and share it on your social media! We can do this!! </p>
<p>We want to also thank our fans who have gotten us this far. It has been your support and attendance of our shows week after week that funded the recording process of the album. We love you guys and we can't wait to share this album with you!!! </p>

Music is my passion and I refuse to stop writing it no matter how hard it gets.

</div><p><br/></p><div>
</div><p>I took a break from music for a few years while working at a call centre and after awhile decided it was time to get back into the groove of things so I teamed up again with my old friend Mike the original bass player for Enerv8 and Matt whom we met while working at the call centre and discovered he was an amazing singer.</p><div>
</div><p>Things where going we'll for a few months we even got another member to join on the drums, it turned out Matt was not only a good singer but also a talented song writer so we teamed up to work toward our first ever EP album and even had plans to start recording in Hamilton Ontario but things fell through as Matt later on had personal matters to attend to and left the band. Things once again fell apart for ENERV8 and after Matt left so did the other members. I took some time off and traveled to Asia where I lived in Thailand for awhile. I worked on a rice farm and while I was living their I kept writing songs on me acoustic guitar. The experience was so inspiring I had to write music about it.  Now I'm back home and have lots of new material.</p><div>

<p><u>Il progetto</u></p>
<p><i>Valmaradio: la radio dei giovani
per i giovani!</i></p>
<p>Valmaradio nasce
da un'idea di alcuni ragazzi della campagna Riminese (Valmarecchia)
che vogliono un luogo dove ritrovarsi e far sentire la propria voce.
Il progetto? Creare una radio che parli dei giovani e ai giovani.</p>
<p>Prima di tutto è
uno spazio di aggregazione e divertimento (che si sa, in campagna non
c'è molto da fare per i ragazzi) ma è anche un'occasione per
riflettere su ciò che è dentro e fuori da noi e raccontarlo nel
linguaggio radiofonico. 
</p>
<p><span>In
una società che non ha più speranze nel futuro Valmaradio vuole
essere un'occasione per confrontarsi, raccontarsi e sognare in
grande!</span></p>

<p><u>La storia</u></p>
<p><strong>ValmaRadio </strong>nasce nell'autunno 2014 quando un
gruppo di giovani di Villa Verucchio (RN), incoraggiato dal parroco e
dalle istituzioni del paese, decide di fondare una radio.</p>
<p>Subito si sparge la voce e si forma un primo nucleo che, senza
alcuna competenza tecnica, ma con tanta voglia di fare e di imparare,
comincia a informarsi e chiedere aiuto ma soprattutto a interrogarsi
su cosa fare. Già, perché avere un microfono non basta, bisogna
sapere cosa dire.</p>
<p>Cose da dire ce ne sono tante e diverse! Nasce così l’idea di
una radio radicata nel territorio, ma che guardi ben oltre i confini
del paese! Una radio che passi molta musica di ogni genere, lasciando
anche spazio a racconti, storie e notizie. Una radio aperta a tutti,
che possa diventare un punto di riferimento per i giovani che
vogliono far sentire la propria musica e la propria voce ben più
lontano delle quattro sedie di un bar.</p>
<p>Il nome è presto detto e anche il motto nasce naturalmente. 
</p>
<p><b>ValmaRadio</b></p>
<p>…<i>perché la musica è parecchia in Valmarecchia!</i></p>
<p>Il gruppo cresce ed emergono le prime idee per i programmi, mentre
lo studio della radio comincia a prendere forma all’interno del
campanile di Villa Verucchio, grazie alle attrezzature gentilmente

Il progetto
Valmaradio: la radio dei giovani
per i giovani!
Valmaradio nasce
da un'idea di alcuni ragazzi della campagna Riminese (Valmarecchia)
che vogliono un luogo dove ritrovarsi e far sentire la propria voce.
Il progetto? Creare una radio che parli dei giovani e ai giovani.
Prima di tutto è
uno spazio di aggregazione e divertimento (che si sa, in campagna non
c'è molto da fare per i ragazzi) ma è anche un'occasione per
riflettere su ciò che è dentro e fuori da noi e raccontarlo nel
linguaggio radiofonico. 

In
una società che non ha più speranze nel futuro Valmaradio vuole
essere un'occasione per confrontarsi, raccontarsi e sognare in
grande!




La storia
ValmaRadio nasce nell'autunno 2014 quando un
gruppo di giovani di Villa Verucchio (RN), incoraggiato dal parroco e
dalle istituzioni del paese, decide di fondare una radio.
Subito si sparge la voce e si forma un primo nucleo che, senza
alcuna competenza tecnica, ma con tanta voglia di fare e di imparare,
comincia a informarsi e chiedere aiuto ma soprattutto a interrogarsi
su cosa fare. Già, perché avere un microfono non basta, bisogna
sapere cosa dire.
Cose da dire ce ne sono tante e diverse! Nasce così l’idea di
una radio radicata nel territorio, ma che guardi ben oltre i confini
del paese! Una radio che passi molta musica di ogni genere, lasciando
anche spazio a racconti, storie e notizie. Una radio aperta a tutti,
che possa diventare un punto di riferimento per i giovani che
vogliono far sentire la propria musica e la propria voce ben più
lontano delle quattro sedie di un bar.
Il nome è presto detto e anche il motto nasce naturalmente. 

ValmaRadio
…perché la musica è parecchia in Valmarecchia!
Il gruppo cresce ed emergono le prime idee per i programmi, mentre
lo studio della radio comincia a prendere forma all’interno del
campanile di Villa Verucchio, grazie alle attrezzature gentilmente
donate da tanti amici.
Ad aprile 2015, dopo un mesetto di rodaggio, ValmaRadio comincia a
trasmettere sui 103.85 FM in Valmarecchia e in streaming dal sito
www.valmaradio.com.
Stiamo ancora crescendo e per farlo abbiamo bisogno anche di te!

<h3>WHY WE NEED THE MONEY?</h3>
<div>When David Noceda and David Limon started the idea, it was so difficult to find people interested on the developing of the website. Many people and musicians tought we were going to steal their music, even when they really need more spaces for presentations. </div>
<div>In 2014 we notice that the cost of inversion was very high, so we organized concerts and tours to raise money. Our first inversion was of $5,000 for the website, then we planned the ""MusicSoul Beyond the Walls"" Festival in the city of Puebla. The concert was so successful that many musicians around Mexico contacted us. Right now we have on the website bands and solo projects from: Coahuila, Baja California, Puebla, Mexico City, Tabasco, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Monterrey, Sonora, Veracruz, Chiapas and even from Argentin or Los Angeles.</div>
<div>This year, we need more money for the developing and consolidation of the app not only in Mexico, because we want to expand to North America and Europe. The app is just the first part of MusicSoul, in 2 years we want to produce and create a company for independent music plus an own place for concerts. The cost of the app is high as a result of  the lack of programmers in our contry. So it would be amazing if other people get involved into the project.</div>

The plant spirits have taught me simple truths that I share through my music; The value of an open heart, harmony with nature, trust in self, love, humility, community, family, spirit, kindness, courage. 
I've seen the way these sounds can inspire deep healing and transformation. Music is medicine. 
More positivity, more love, more uplifting vibrational medicine that's a gift this world needs right now. A message and a feeling that can open hearts to the beauty within us all, and from that place a natural impulse for good action arises, kindness and harmony. 
This is my purpose, this is how I serve.  
   How else can you help? If you cant donate with money please spread the word of this campaign, share the video, spread the music. Listen, enjoy, dance and open your heart to the inspiration around you.  Blessings!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Campaign In Short</h3>
<p>Our campaign is aimed at raising funds to promote the single ""Hold On"" and the <a href=""https://t.co/vrcC12xVhG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Official Music Video</a> for the song.  We are reaching out to everyone on social media to collectively seek as much support as possible.  The financial contributions will tremendously help us in our efforts to get this song heard/played, as well as the video seen, by hopefully millions!  If we hit our goal, we will be able to potentially get this song aired on FM and Online Radio, and the music video aired on Television (as well as seen on various Online Platforms).</p>
<p>Simply put: WE NEED YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO HELP US SPREAD THE MESSAGE OF ""HOLD ON"" THROUGHOUT THE WORLD!</p>

<p>Our choir<i>, Le Cantanti di Chicago</i> (""The Singing Women of Chicago""), was founded in 2014 by  Dhilanthi Fernando, who is also the director. A group of very diverse women, ranging in age from teenagers to octogenarians, from very different ethnic, racial and regional backgrounds, we strive to use our voices to uplift the human spirit and bring wholeness to our lives, and through that, to the world. We are proud to have been selected to participate in the 2017 Serenade! Choral Festival, in Washington DC. This festival is organized by Classical Movements, Inc., in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to celebrate the 100<sup>th</sup> birthday of President John F. Kennedy and founding of the Peace Corps. We are thrilled and honored to be selected, but we need your generous support to make our trip a reality.</p>
<p>We will join select choirs from the US and around the world to participate in performances and service projects in the Washington, D.C.,area from June 27 to July 3, 2017. The choirs will also participate in educational events focused on how music promotes friendship, peace, and cultural diplomacy, and how it brings joy and wholeness to all the peoples of our world.</p>
<p>The festival culminates in a Massed Choir Grand Finale at the Kennedy Center, on July 3, with Joshua Habermann, Director of the Dallas Symphony Chorus and Santa Fe Desert Chorale, conducting a choral work specially commissioned for the festival.</p>
<p>With hope and optimism, we have committed to participating in this once in a lifetime opportunity, and we request your help to raise a total of $48,000, which will fully fund our entire choir’s expenses, including room and board and round trip airfare, and other miscellaneous expenses that will arise. </p>
<p>You can support our work in sharing the joy of music and promoting the ideals President Kennedy championed—Courage, Freedom, Justice, Service, and Gratitude—by contributing at any level that is comfortable for you. Please consider funding a full travel scholarship for a singer ($1700) or a partial scholarship in any amount. </p>
<p><i>Le Cantanti di Chicago</i> is a 501(c)(3) organization. Thus, your contribution will be tax-deductible.</p>
<p>This celebration provides <i>Le Cantanti</i> an unparalleled opportunity to fulfill our mission to “use our voices to uplift the human spirit and to support causes that promote peace, hope, and wholeness in the world.”  By supporting our trip, you help bring our choir and the city of Chicago to the national stage.</p>

<h3>A Left-Handed Way</h3>
<p>I am Thomas Newbold and I grew up in Petaluma in the north San Francisco bay area. I have lived in Southern California and studied Music, Percussion Performance, and Music Therapy since the year 2000. The longer I live in So-Cal the more I appreciate family and romanticize the bay as the beautiful place where I grew up and learned to think and feel.</p>
<p>I have written songs that represent this love for people, music, the bay area, California, nature, and how all these things effect us in the human experience. I have created this album and am asking for help getting it off the ground so that I can share it with any and all who may enjoy it. </p>
<p>If I didn't think there was a real chance of you liking this record, I promise, I would never ask.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why $4230?</h3>
<p>I am conservatively estimating everything at $5000 and have raised $770 at a kickoff event. Below is a detailed breakdown of where the money will go.</p>
<p><strong>Recording/Engineering/Mastering: $2000</strong></p>
<p>I have a professional studio lined up with a platinum record producer and engineer who is offering recording, mixing, and mastering, at the extremely reduced price of $250 per song (total!). I am looking to do 8 songs for an approximately 40 minute album to fit on LPs.</p>
<p><strong>Musicians: $1000</strong></p>
<p>Most of the instruments will be played by myself and my producer/multi-instrumentalist, Doug Grean. I <i><strong>will</strong></i> be seeking a <strong>Pedal Steel Guitarist</strong> (This is one of my biggest dreams for the record), and <strong>Hammond Organ</strong> player who I am hoping will enjoy the project enough to join in ""on the cheap.""</p>
<p><strong>LP and CD manufacturing: $2000</strong></p>
<p>I have a quote for small run CD manufacturing complete with gate-fold jacket and booklet insert (for artwork, lyrics, thank you's, etc.)  $700 for 100 CDs/Booklets/Jackets</p>
<p>I have a quote for small run vinyl manufacturing with sleeve, plain jacket with black writing, and cellophane wrap: $1300 for 100 (White Vinyl with white writing on a black label).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you've ever seen me perform in the rock/pop/country realm then, hopefully, you agree that I always do my very best to leave my heart and soul on the stage and provide the best renditions possible of any music, mine or covered. This project will provide a new avenue for creative expression and you can be a part of fostering and sharing in this endeavor. It could potentially springboard a new touring and performing act, many more new records, or at the very least more audience-inclusive, intimate house concerts and parties. I'm not out to get rich and famous, I'm here to share and entertain. Just to create good, homemade, enjoyable music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is always some risk involved in any project creative or otherwise. My biggest fear is that if I don't raise enough money to really get this thing cranking that I may take too long working on it, while also caring for my twins and budgeting for our family life. I promise to do my very best to compromise my dreams with the realities of a reasonable timeline and the expectations of the beautiful and wonderful people who have donated. I have carefully budgeted and laid out the numbers above,but should there be any ""leftover"" funds at the end of recording and manufacturing I promise to use them to A) Give back through throwing another house concert/party for donors. B) Use the money to promote the record online/radio/etc. OR C) Use the money to record more songs either for this record or future singles/EPs/LPs, which will be made available to contributors. </p>

Over the years in Bremen I developed my taste in music and special interest in orchestral and chamber music of various genres. I also was able to dig into the professional world by holding a 3-year internship with the NDR Radiophilharmonie in Hannover.</p><p><strong>Tanglewood</strong></p><p>I always knew this place through my mother, who spent a summer there in the 70’s. I was around 2 years old when I first visited. This summer was my 5th time making music at Tanglewood, which has become a special place for me, because of its tradition and the opportunities I have been given. I have performed with some of the finest young musicians in the US and with artists such as Emanuel Ax, Mark Morris or Dawn Upshaw. In 2014, I was principal cellist of the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra under Charles Dutoit and got to lead the cello section this summer under the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s music director Andris Nelsons in an all Brahms program.</p><p><strong>Rice University</strong></p><p>My being at Rice is the perfect example one thing leading to another. If I had not joined the Tanglewood Music Center in 2014 I would not have met Norman Fischer, who I’ve had the pleasure of studying with for 2 semesters already. I feel I was able to improve my playing quite a bit in the past year, focusing on technique and healthy playing, which will be essential the longer I want to play the cello at a high level. I have gained deeper interest in the technical aspects of cello playing and now understand, that it's important to be able to say what I want to say on the instrument. Music of course comes first, but knowing very vividly what you’re doing technically will lead to a more successful performance, that will captivate an audience.</p><p><strong>The New Bow</strong></p><p>The more I went into detail about my cello playing, the more I was able to make a judgement about my equipment. When I played several bows belonging to my teacher, it occurred to me how important a good bow is; in fact it is just as important as the instrument itself. The bows I tried were manufactured by David Hawthorne in Cambridge, Massachusetts and I was able to play all of his models. Because the only bow I own is a $300 carbon-fiber bow, I decided to assign Mr Hawthorne to manufacture a bow for myself, which was also adjusted and customized for my needs on the instrument. The bow is a copy of a bow by Francois Lupot, which Yo-Yo Ma owns. I received the bow mid-june and was able „to get to know it“ while I was at Tanglewood. Instantly I felt like this was a huge upgrade to my playing. It draws a beautiful, rich sound from the instrument and I am still discovering more and more options for different colors. The bow allows me to be in control when playing technically challenging pieces and gives great response with any possible stroke.

<h2>Operation Streetwork Cali</h2>
<p>We are The Present Elders, an electronic duo that specializes in unforgettable performances where all the music you hear is composed and manipulated live through synthesizers, samplers, sequencers, drum machines and FX.  We take a craftsman approach to electronic music where we use hardware instruments instead of computers.  We're made up of Brother El and Radius ETC, two veterans of the Chicago electronic and hip hop scenes.  Our focus has been to create incomparable music that represents a new sound and style while sending only positive, warm, healing vibes wherever we play. </p>
<p>Now we want to take our show on the road to California.  We will be traveling while playing a series of free pop up shows across the Golden State.  Everyone knows Chicago winters are brutal and not suitable for much outside activity, including street performing. Our goal is to start a movement that breaks barriers.  A movement to demystify electronic performance.  A movement to spread healing vibrations through music and genuinely connecting.  And a movement to give the power back to the artists - we want to be close to the people, not the politics.</p>
<ul>
<li>While we also perform traditional shows, we've recently made it our mission to remove the barriers between electronic performers and the attendees through impromptu pop up shows throughout different cities.  These are free, live and open to the public as we create and manipulate beats after quickly materializing before you on the street.</li>
<li>Over the summer, we held 15+ pop up shows throughout the city of Chicago and found that this was one of the most free and real way to connect with like minded people.  We are now taking the show on the road to The Golden State.  First we plan on stopping in LA at the beginning of the month then heading north to The Bay Area.  We are documenting our trip both with videos and sound recordings so you can follow us on our journey. </li>
<li>While we we see this trip in our mind, we need your help willing it into existence.  Any contribution would be an amazing help to cover the cost of a month of free shows that we are playing across California. </li>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/brotherel/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Brother El</a>, I am a spontaneous composer and multidisciplinary creative who uses music and visual arts to express ideas while connecting people to a higher plane of consciousness. Raised in the hip hop ascetic and DIY movement, I constantly look to push the boundaries of music as an expert in the Live PA field. Formally trained as an Audio Engineer and Graphic Designer, I have acquired many different skills running The Beat Bank, an independent record label.  My sets often include using sequencers, synthesizers, drum  machines and samplers with doing fully improvised and live beat-making.  My unique style has been described as Chicago’s pulse, the breath of hip hop, the heartbeat of club respiration and the clashing fusion of South Side meeting ancestral roots.</p>
<p>My name is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/radiusetc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Radius</a>, I'm from Chicago and I started crafting beats in 2001 with a focus on multi-dimensional ""post-genre"" based compositions. After producing tracks for local rappers, I began to further hone skills as a producer/live performance artist, by winning Chicago area beat battles and later performing in various hiphop and electronic showcases with the Moment Sound Crew (Garo, Lokua &amp; Slava). I'm known for my improv live PA/beat sets with hardware. The music exhibits a wide variety of tempos &amp; sounds. I'm highly inspired by hiphop, jazz, dub &amp; house music roots; due to my Chicago upbringing.  I am also head of Etc Records (Ear To Chicago) and curate showcases to help bridge the live electronic music community.</p>
<p>Together, we make <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ThePresentElders/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Present Elders,</a> a genre bending spontaneous composition duo focused on spreading positive vibes and creating hard hitting electronic music.  </p>

<h3>Come Together To Help Each Other</h3>
<p>What we're looking for is help to create this movement while documenting our journey with videos and a record.  Because these shows are spontaneous, free and completely open to the public we are just asking for help covering travel and production costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're thinking that costs come down to a few categories - travel, equipment and production.  We are asking for about $3,000 for each.  For travel we need flights, a car to rent, gas.  For equipment, we need a generator to power the show and a PA speaker.  There are also costs for Videographers and  actually producing the record of our performances across California.  Add in a few things like food, insurance and licensing the grand total is about $10,000</li>
<li>We've got lots of ways for you to potentially contribute!  Some of the more interesting ones are: the record we produce from our performances in Cali, a The Present Elders T-Shirt, digital EP of your choice among radius's and brother el's records <u>all signed</u> for $100.  There are also options to purchase each of those items individually ranging from $10-$25.  Other packages include us performing for you live or writing you a personalized song!  At the very least, we'd like to personally thank anybody for joining the cause via video if they can give us a five spot.</li>
<li>By the way, we're doing this regardless of whether or not we reach our goal, but your contributions go a long way to make sure we can keep going and put on as many quality shows as possible.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Join a Cultural Movement</h3>
<p>Our mission is to bring people together in the community while taking the power of music back to the people in the streets.  We want to be able to interact directly with the audience in a raw setting to help demystify what we do with our instruments. </p>
<ul>
<li>People at our shows enjoy themselves and the atmosphere is full of healing vibes.<div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xwerBF5LnXA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div></div>Our main purpose is to have a celebration of community, music and togetherness with any and all who would like to join us.  Our goal is to ultimately create a movement to take the power of music back to the people.  We've seen our music resonate positively for people from all walks of life and of all ages.  You can see children, old folks, businessmen and the homeless all dancing throughout our many videos.  We want to continue to share this positive energy and vibration across the country with as many people as possible.</li>
<li>We are both veterans of the electronic music scene both in Chicago and internationally.  This past summer we've shifted our focus from traditional shows to pop up performances.  We've popped up at places like the Chicago Cultural Center, Ohio St. Beach, Garfield Park Conservatory and many other culturally significant areas throughout the city.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>People value our transparency and we put ourselves out there each show and get immediate feedback from our audience.  Its a difficult operation, where we need to be careful navigating locations, police, weather, equipment and attendees. All of these issues are additional reasons why we need your help! We've got a lot of experience with pop up shows and while problems do arise, there are always solutions.</p>

<ul><li>Over the past summer and fall, we did several (over 20) pop up shows across the city of Chicago.  On the streets, almost anything can happen. We've experienced rowdy people, drunk people, police and blockades. We've also dealt with equipment issues and weather problems.  Most importantly, we’ve helped to influence and bring people <strong>TOGETHER</strong> who are all looking to connect over music, beats and good vibrations</li></ul>

<p></p><h4>Hello there!</h4><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Singapore musicians Jeffrey and Eugene's debut concert, 'INITIATION', was started in early 2015, during their apprenticeship under esteemed local arranger and composer, Felix Phang.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">'INITIATION' is a self-organised original showcase of New-melodic Jazz, which entails the freedom of an improviser to communicate through a series of melodies that excites and captivates the listener, allowing them to experience a new sonic approach to hearing musical phrases. 'INITIATION' will also feature two compositions from Caleb Koa in the opening act.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The showcase will also feature many of Singapore's top musicians, including drummer Aaron James Lee (The Steve McQueens), bassist Jase Sng (The Steve McQueens), keyboardists Audrey Tengkey (TAJ) and Eugene Ang, as well as 7 other established musicians.</p><p></p>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2><h2><b>About The Project</b></h2>
<p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">There will be two different band line-ups in order to exhibit their unique, contrasting jazz-fusion compositions. Jeffrey writes for a string quartet, while Eugene writes for a horn trio (trumpet and 2 saxophones). Both bands are backed by a full rhythm section of keyboard, bass and drums.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445564308/ua3qwzzcdnitkcikonev.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445823918/t4qxpvjptxischpku5di.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The showcase aims to generate awareness and appreciation of jazz music, it being one of the least appreciated genre in Singapore. Starting from the local music scene, Jeffrey and Eugene have hopes of expanding Singapore's circle of jazz audiences, and letting local listeners know that jazz doesn't have to be abstract; it can be as listenable and enjoyable as pop music too. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Not sure if you'll like our project??

_____________________________________________________________________________
Hello there!Singapore musicians Jeffrey and Eugene's debut concert, 'INITIATION', was started in early 2015, during their apprenticeship under esteemed local arranger and composer, Felix Phang.'INITIATION' is a self-organised original showcase of New-melodic Jazz, which entails the freedom of an improviser to communicate through a series of melodies that excites and captivates the listener, allowing them to experience a new sonic approach to hearing musical phrases. 'INITIATION' will also feature two compositions from Caleb Koa in the opening act.The showcase will also feature many of Singapore's top musicians, including drummer Aaron James Lee (The Steve McQueens), bassist Jase Sng (The Steve McQueens), keyboardists Audrey Tengkey (TAJ) and Eugene Ang, as well as 7 other established musicians.
About The Project
There will be two different band line-ups in order to exhibit their unique, contrasting jazz-fusion compositions. Jeffrey writes for a string quartet, while Eugene writes for a horn trio (trumpet and 2 saxophones). Both bands are backed by a full rhythm section of keyboard, bass and drums.The showcase aims to generate awareness and appreciation of jazz music, it being one of the least appreciated genre in Singapore. Starting from the local music scene, Jeffrey and Eugene have hopes of expanding Singapore's circle of jazz audiences, and letting local listeners know that jazz doesn't have to be abstract; it can be as listenable and enjoyable as pop music too. Not sure if you'll like our project??

<p><b>Our Goal</b></p>
<p>With your help, we can create the World’s Largest Collagraph- composed of donated clothing, which represents someone who fought cancer in our community. It is a special opportunity to honor someone in your life, giving thanks to the impact they made on YOU.<br/></p>
<p>To make Impressions of Courage happen, we need to raise $20,000. Here is the great news! A $10,000 matching gift from<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Rudys-Exotic-Mushrooms-and-Produce-398454186946636/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Rudy’s Exotic Mushrooms </a>means that every dollar you donate is doubled, up to $10,000!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Impact</b></p>
<p>Our connection to community driven art allowed us to see that in every community, there are people cancer has touched who are loved and supported and sometimes grieved for, and we wanted to recognize each of them, life-sized and by name. Clothing is such a fundamental way in which we express ourselves, that we felt it would be a great way to show the uniqueness and individuality of the people we want to honor.</p>
<p>Impressions of Courage represents an innovative way to pay tribute to people who have battled cancer. It does this by crowd-sourcing materials which have deep meaning and connection to individuals with the disease, as well as those impacted by it- honoring the uniqueness of each person through community action, while communicating a shared experience using personal symbolism to visually represent the physical presence of cancer on a monumental scale. The culminating event and sheer scale of the artwork challenges viewers to hold the weight of their experience and motivates them to bolster the community behind it. Due to the extraordinary scale of the finished artwork, community involvement, and anticipated media attention given to an attempt to set a world record, we believe our approach is a unique way to tackle the topic of cancer awareness.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From the parent who donates an outfit in honor of their child, to the volunteer who reverently attaches it to panel, to a massive line of clothing representing people we know and love, this project will create an unforgettable public event. With your help, Impressions of Courage will be a compelling portrayal of the humanity behind cancer in our community. </p>

<li>Not that I was affected of being slotted that way, but I was not able to digest the fact that, most of the world thought ""Hindi"" singers could not sing in English. Most of the world thought that Hindi singers could never get into the international arena of singing in English.</li>
<li>A lot of my critics even discouraged me and told me that I could never be in the league of international artists. The fact that hurt me the most is that, just like all other Hindi singers, I didn't even have the team or resources to change this situation.

A lot of my critics even discouraged me and told me that I could never be in the league of international artists.

As you all are aware, I come from a very middle-class background and I am striving hard to make a change for myself as an artist and the Hindi independent artist community at large.
This music album is my effort to prove to all those critics wrong. 
If things work right then I plan to do more of such music albums. However, there will be a ""HINDI"" and ""INDIAN"" touch to the music I'll be doing in my international albums in the future.
So this is a music album not just for me but to encourage every Indian singer. To tell the world and Hindi singers in India that we too can produce and record albums of international class and quality in English. We too can release our music internationally. We too can collaborate with the ""WEST"" and create a world class product.
I believe that India is the largest English-speaking democracy in the world and it is a pity that we are looked down upon when it comes to producing an international quality English album. 

In this effort, I am supported by teams from New Zealand (AIPC Entertainment - executive production), Malaysia (Flensa Production - Video Production) and South America (Franklin Ortiz - songwriter, composer without whom this project would never have been possible).

What you contribute will help us shoot music videos for the album we have recorded, do PR and Promos just like other international albums OR singers but more importantly it will drive a message to the music fraternity in India that we too can sing in English and make a world-class international product.
   What We Need & What You Get Here is a bit more of the details:  We have already recorded all the songs of the album which you can listen to by CLICKing here.
Now we need to promote these songs by with some cool music videos, PR and LIVE performances in India and internationally.
We need a total of $36,000 to make all of this possible. 

$20,000 would be utilised in shooting 3 music videos in picturesque                 New Zealand to promote this album on a global scale.

Your contribution no matter how small or big will make a huge difference to the independent singers community in India. Especially emerging singers like myself who have to continuously face criticism from the international media.


We as Indians, too can sing in English and release an English language album internationally. Artists like AR Rahman have already proved it by winning awards internationally. However, it is easy for a popular artist to do a project like this because they have the media and financial resources to help them.


A project like this is only possible for a Hindi artist like me, if contributors like you, our friends, fans and family are a part of this journey.


Every cent of your contribution will give the much-needed encouragement to all those independent Hindi singers in India like me.


Every cent of your contribution will help us develop a more vibrant singing community in India that is truly global. I believe it will make us all and India proud.


As my fans, you have always supported me in all my efforts in Hindi. I look forward to the same support in this first English album of mine.


  Risks & Challenges If we are unable to achieve our goal, then there is a likelihood that we might not be able to shoot our desired set of 3 videos. There is also a possibility that we might not be able to invest in adequate PR & Promos. There might not be the promo trip as well if we fall short of funds.  We have envisioned that we might encounter such a situation. If so, the New Zealand government grant agencies have agreed to support us in the endeavour. They have been extremely helpful until date.

<p><b>DEEP IN HATE</b> est un groupe de métal français actif depuis plus de dix ans !</p>
<p>Nous avons beaucoup tourné pour faire découvrir notre musique. Vous nous avez peut-être déjà vus dans de grands festivals tels que le <b>Sonisphere</b>, le <b>Hellfest</b> ou encore aux côté de grands groupes tels qu'Arch Enemy, The Black Dahlia Murder, Aborted, Hatebreed, Napalm Death, Carnifex, Rise Of The Northstar, Veil Of Maya et bien d'autres</p>
<p>Notre groupe est constitué d'un staff de 8<b> membres</b> comprenant 5 musiciens, un ingé son, un manager et un chauffeur pro.</p>
<p><b>Pour la totalité d’entre nous la musique est plus qu'une passion, c'est aussi une activité professionnelle.</b> Cours de musique, masterclass, production, sonorisation, enregistrements, coaching.</p>
<p>En plus du trauma psychologique, de la crainte de perdre l’un d’entre nous et des images qui peinent à s’effacer tant le choc était violent en ce dimanche 14 Novembre 2015 (accident à 120 Km/H sur l'autoroute), la perte du van et les dégâts matériels sont donc un énorme coup dur pour le groupe, <b>menaçant directement la pérennité de nos projets.</b></p>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2>

<p><b>Ce fut la douche froide après l'accident de constater que le van était bon pour la casse et qu'une partie du materiel était cassé ou abimé.</b> Après calcul des frais, <b>les pertes sont encore bien trop gigantesques à assumer pour le groupe seul </b>et ce malgré la participation de l'assurance.</p>
<p>Une fois la peur passée et le choc encaissé nous nous sommes dit que la tournée devait continuer malgré tout ! « Show must go on » ! Pour les prochaines dates nous louerons un van et du matériel, mais nos ressources sont limitées et nous ne pourrons le faire que sur un laps de temps très court.</p>
<p>Heureusement nous sommes tous en vie et en bonne santé, mais difficile d'être serein après une telle casse.</p>
<p><b>Si grâce à vous nous pouvons racheter un van et du matériel nous pourrions continuer à jouer et à vous donner du plaisir ! Nous aimons jouer pour vous, notre musique sans public n’a absolument aucun sens.</b></p>

Presentation
DEEP IN HATE is a French metal band active for more than ten years!
We toured a lot to share our music. You perhaps have already see the band at major festivals such as Sonisphere, Hellfest or with bands like Arch Enemy, The Black Dahlia Murder, Aborted, Hatebreed, Napalm Death, Carnifex, Rise Of The Northstar Veil Of Maya and more.
Our band is made of eight members including five musicians, a sound engineer, a manager and a pro driver.
For all of us the music is more than a passion, it is also a professional activity. Music lessons, masterclasses, production, sound, recordings, coaching.
In addition to the psychological trauma, fear of losing one of us and images that are struggling to fade because of the violent shock in this Sunday, November 14, 2015 (accident to 120 Km / H on the highway) The loss of the van and material damages are an enormous blow to the band, directly threatening the sustainability of our projects.
What we need and what you get
It was a cold shower after the accident, seeing that the van was completely dead and that some of the equipment was broken or damaged. After calculating the expenses, losses are still too huge for the band alone, despite the insurance.
Once past the fear and shock we said that the tour would proceed anyway! ""Show must go on!"" For the next gigs we will rent a van and equipment, but our resources are limited and we can only do that in a very short time.
Fortunately we are all alive and healthy, but it's difficult to be calm after such a break.
If this campain is a succes we can buy a van and equipment and then could continue to play and give you pleasure! We like to play for you, our music without audience is absolutely a nonsense.
We never thought of making a crowfundings campaign.
If we appeal to you it's by necessity, as we are taken by surprise.
We need your help to pick ourselves up and continue to live as a band. We warmly appreciate any contribution, however small it may be. We wish to show our gratitude and reward your generosity as much as possible!

<p><b>Maureen Choi Quartet</b></p>
<p>We are a Spanish Latin jazz quartet
based in Madrid. My curiosity and interest in Spanish music and Latin rhythms
led me to put together this band when I moved to Spain from New York.</p>
<p>In the process of finding and creating
the unique voice of Maureen Choi Quartet, we have created our latest album
“Ida y Vuelta”, which reflects all of our personal influences and experiences,
the sounds from our homes...from Cuba, South America, Spain, jazz and western
classical music. </p>

<br/>
<p><b>South by Southwest
and USA Tour</b></p>
<p>Our quartet has been selected to
perform in South by SouthWest in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>This invitation to participate in South
by Southwest is such a huge opportunity to share the work that we have been
doing with festival programmers, booking agents, and managers which will help
us get the exposure that we need to perform our music world wide.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the festival does not
pay for the performance, the flights or the hotels. With this campaign we want
to ask you to help us bring the quartet over to participate in this great
event. </p>
<p>To take maximum advantage of our trip
to the US, we are going to the Midwest after Texas to perform a few
concerts. Be sure to check out our perks for concert tickets. </p>

</div></div>","Maureen Choi Quartet
We are a Spanish Latin jazz quartet
based in Madrid. My curiosity and interest in Spanish music and Latin rhythms
led me to put together this band when I moved to Spain from New York.
In the process of finding and creating
the unique voice of Maureen Choi Quartet, we have created our latest album
“Ida y Vuelta”, which reflects all of our personal influences and experiences,
the sounds from our homes...from Cuba, South America, Spain, jazz and western
classical music. 



South by Southwest
and USA Tour
Our quartet has been selected to
perform in South by SouthWest in Austin, Texas.
This invitation to participate in South
by Southwest is such a huge opportunity to share the work that we have been
doing with festival programmers, booking agents, and managers which will help
us get the exposure that we need to perform our music world wide.
Unfortunately, the festival does not
pay for the performance, the flights or the hotels. With this campaign we want
to ask you to help us bring the quartet over to participate in this great
event. 
To take maximum advantage of our trip
to the US, we are going to the Midwest after Texas to perform a few
concerts. Be sure to check out our perks for concert tickets.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Greg Johnson.  Some of you may know me as the Director of Jazz Studies at the Marin School of the Arts, or for my varying roles as a saxophonist for Bob Mintzer's Big Band in Los Angeles or perhaps from my work with alternative band Saint Motel.  Maybe you've even played some of my big-band music in your high school, college, community or professional big band!</p>
<p>On the night of February 16th, I'll be presenting the world premier of my newest big-band suite ""Visions of Kansas City.""  This music is inspired by the great music of Kansas City era Count Basie.  The band will feature some of the best musicians from New York City, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.  It will also feature a super special guest that not even the band will know about until the night of.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get the best product involving the best people, we need your help!</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $8000 to pay for personnel, production costs and travel expenses.</li>
<li>Contributors will have a wide variety of packages to choose from including performances, educational clinics, concert tickets and much more.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've seen the impact of supportive, arts-inclined patronage positively affect communities in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Texas, Nebraska and California.   </p>
<p>As a teacher I can't ignore the benefits of a good musical community to kids.  Having positive, supportive musicians around in my childhood was a key factor in my own choice to become a musician and a teacher.   Now as a director of music at the Marin School of the Arts, I am seeing my students thrive in a definitive way when they receive the support of the community.</p>
<p>On a personal note, big-band music has been the central focus of my life for the last decade.    Having written over 200 compositions and arrangements, big-band music has allowed me to express my take on humanity and has helped me connect with hundreds of people in places that I never would have imagined.  The high-quality media that will come from this project will allow me to make myself more visible as a big-band composer to the world at large. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is challenging to put together a project like this.  On one hand, I'll need to finish the two hours of music that I'm in the midst of.  On the other hand, I'll need to pay for the time and energy of 18 amazing professional musicians who will be coming from all over the country.  This is not only expensive, but an extremely rare opportunity.  </p>
<p>While my life will be busy up until the day of the concert, these challenges are what I live for.  To perform my own music with people I admire in front of people that I love is a dream.  </p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>During times of uncertainty and challenge, we need the healing power of music more than ever!  Through this commissioning and recording project, we aim to create and share new beauty with the world through the production of 2 (TWO!) brand new major works for the flute, 2 new gorgeous albums of flute music, and a music video and DVD recording. Help support the arts while also being part of a bigger message of hope and beauty!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Project Details</h3>
<p>Carnegie Hall performer Dr. Alyssa Schwartz has commissioned internationally acclaimed composer Dr. Daniel Baldwin to compose two new major solo flute works: a Concerto and a Sonata.  Our vision is to give a gift of peace and beauty to the world through music... and to add two new substantial pieces to the existing body of flute repertory!  </p>
<p>We have partnered with Polyphony Artist Management to produce two gorgeous new albums of flute music and a DVD recording of the Concerto.  The first album will include the premiere recording of Dr. Baldwin's new Flute Sonata and other works for solo flute that emphasize the beauty of the instrument.  The second album will include the premiere recording of Dr. Baldwin's new Flute Concerto.  The DVD will include the live recording of the world premiere of the Concerto as well as exclusive interviews with Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Baldwin.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Project Timeline</h3>
<p>Dr. Baldwin's new Flute Sonata will be completed by May 2021, and the first album will be recorded by December 2021 and released shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Dr. Baldwin's new Flute Concerto will be completed by December 2021.  The premiere live performance of the Concerto will be scheduled in the Spring of 2022, and the second album and DVD will be recorded by December 2022 and released shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>*Please note: this timeline may be subject to change due to potential challenges related to COVD-19.  It is the hope of all involved that no changes will need to be made.  If any challenges or delays should arise, all donors will be notified in writing with as much notice as possible. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Project Costs</h3>
<p>This is a substantial and multi-tiered project, involving a large number of artists!  The total cost for the full project amounts to ~$11,500.00 and breaks down as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    New Flute Concerto Commission: $4,500.00</p>
<p>    New Flute Sonata Commission: $1,500.00</p>
<p>    Recording Engineer for Album 01: $1,500.00</p>
<p>    Recording Engineer for Album 02: $1,500.00</p>
<p>    Videographer for DVD: $1,500.00</p>
<p>    Mechanical Licensing Fees, Album Art, and Distribution: ~$1,000.00</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr. Schwartz, Dr. Baldwin, and Polyphony Artist Management are all investing in this project financially and are happy to do so!  However, through fundraising and CD pre-sales, we hope to offset some of the costs for these projects while also striving to share our music with as many people as we can. </p>

We have partnered with Polyphony Artist Management to produce two gorgeous new albums of flute music and a DVD recording of the Concerto.  The first album will include the premiere recording of Dr. Baldwin's new Flute Sonata and other works for solo flute that emphasize the beauty of the instrument.  The second album will include the premiere recording of Dr. Baldwin's new Flute Concerto.  The DVD will include the live recording of the world premiere of the Concerto as well as exclusive interviews with Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Baldwin.

 
Project Timeline
Dr. Baldwin's new Flute Sonata will be completed by May 2021, and the first album will be recorded by December 2021 and released shortly thereafter.
Dr. Baldwin's new Flute Concerto will be completed by December 2021.  The premiere live performance of the Concerto will be scheduled in the Spring of 2022, and the second album and DVD will be recorded by December 2022 and released shortly thereafter. 
*Please note: this timeline may be subject to change due to potential challenges related to COVD-19.  It is the hope of all involved that no changes will need to be made.  If any challenges or delays should arise, all donors will be notified in writing with as much notice as possible. 
 

Project Costs
This is a substantial and multi-tiered project, involving a large number of artists!  The total cost for the full project amounts to ~$11,500.00 and breaks down as follows:
 
    New Flute Concerto Commission: $4,500.00
    New Flute Sonata Commission: $1,500.00
    Recording Engineer for Album 01: $1,500.00
    Recording Engineer for Album 02: $1,500.00
    Videographer for DVD: $1,500.00
    Mechanical Licensing Fees, Album Art, and Distribution: ~$1,000.00
 
Dr. Schwartz, Dr. Baldwin, and Polyphony Artist Management are all investing in this project financially and are happy to do so!  However, through fundraising and CD pre-sales, we hope to offset some of the costs for these projects while also striving to share our music with as many people as we can.

<h3>Wait: your kinda old to be starting a career in music aren't you?</h3>
<p>Nope.  next question</p>
<p>Last year I was rushing and anxious to start recording and my son says: ""Dad you only get one chance to make a first record.   Take your time and do it right"". Sage advice.  So I asked him to draw me a logo since he is an amazing artist.  In no time the Stardog paw is born.  Wow.  Iconic.</p>
<p>I am a hard person to slow down.  I have had two major careers till now.  Theatre and Construction.  I have toured theatre shows all over this country,  but I am proudest of my time doing The <i>Living Tarot.  I m</i>ortgaged the house, bought a 64 greyhound bus, toured the country for 4 years doing hundreds of shows.  An interactive show about and for community and unity.</p>
<p>Some people retire at this age...I am just getting warmed up.    </p>
<p>I can get things done.  Plan tours, travel, show up perform with gusto, repeat.  I love it.</p>
<p>I will use this abum to springboard my music to the world.  Music will become a part of my bigger plans to tour and engage communities everywhere.</p>
<p>You find me at a crossroads in my life.  I have left construction like a bad marriage.  It was time and now all of my pent-up creativity is pouring out.</p>
<p>I need help making my 1st album of original music.  The most personal challenge of my life. I have done many wild and creative things in my life but putting my music and voice out there is by far the hardest.</p>
<p>Your support will make a huge change in my life.  Your encouragement contributes to helping me do more of the critical healing work I do in communities everywhere.</p>
<p>I need you and I need your help to record this 1st album, it is US recording this music, it is WE playing these songs.</p>
<h3>Can't you just record it on your cellphone?</h3>
<p>Ummm No.  Next question</p>
<p>Today the music scene is bustling with bands and musicians.  You have to have a quality sound and an impeccable attention to detail to catch peoples listening ears.  So I've been prepping and writing and readying myself for an immersion in performance and recording.  I am opening up my artistic brain so watch out....no telling how far this could go.</p>
<p>This means I need $ for studio time $300/day, Engineer/super pro musicians ($2-300/day), backup singers, digital mastering, CD's and Vinyl printing costs not to mention artwork, social media help, digital releases, god it makes me dizzy just writing it down.  All in all I have budgeted and need to raise at least $11,500.  More donations help to record more songs for smaller releases I hope to release such things as a 5 song mini ep with my anti-war and social commentary songs about immigration, veteran suicide, guns, war, etc.</p>
<p>I have one song already in the can, as they say with my phenomenal engineer and amazing musician Darwin Smith.  In the studio we transformed a pretty simple acoustic guitar and vocal song into a trancy, hypnotic, hard hitting 9 minute psych rock song about a bombing of civilians in Syria.</p>
<p>Your funding will help me uncover the magic that is underneath my songs and release that magic to the world.  It is needed.</p>

Nope.  next question
Last year I was rushing and anxious to start recording and my son says: ""Dad you only get one chance to make a first record.   Take your time and do it right"". Sage advice.  So I asked him to draw me a logo since he is an amazing artist.  In no time the Stardog paw is born.  Wow.  Iconic.
I am a hard person to slow down.  I have had two major careers till now.  Theatre and Construction.  I have toured theatre shows all over this country,  but I am proudest of my time doing The Living Tarot.  I mortgaged the house, bought a 64 greyhound bus, toured the country for 4 years doing hundreds of shows.  An interactive show about and for community and unity.
Some people retire at this age...I am just getting warmed up.    
I can get things done.  Plan tours, travel, show up perform with gusto, repeat.  I love it.
I will use this abum to springboard my music to the world.  Music will become a part of my bigger plans to tour and engage communities everywhere.
You find me at a crossroads in my life.  I have left construction like a bad marriage.  It was time and now all of my pent-up creativity is pouring out.
I need help making my 1st album of original music.  The most personal challenge of my life. I have done many wild and creative things in my life but putting my music and voice out there is by far the hardest.
Your support will make a huge change in my life.  Your encouragement contributes to helping me do more of the critical healing work I do in communities everywhere.
I need you and I need your help to record this 1st album, it is US recording this music, it is WE playing these songs.
Can't you just record it on your cellphone?
Ummm No.  Next question
Today the music scene is bustling with bands and musicians.  You have to have a quality sound and an impeccable attention to detail to catch peoples listening ears.  So I've been prepping and writing and readying myself for an immersion in performance and recording.  I am opening up my artistic brain so watch out....no telling how far this could go.
This means I need $ for studio time $300/day, Engineer/super pro musicians ($2-300/day), backup singers, digital mastering, CD's and Vinyl printing costs not to mention artwork, social media help, digital releases, god it makes me dizzy just writing it down.  All in all I have budgeted and need to raise at least $11,500.  More donations help to record more songs for smaller releases I hope to release such things as a 5 song mini ep with my anti-war and social commentary songs about immigration, veteran suicide, guns, war, etc.
I have one song already in the can, as they say with my phenomenal engineer and amazing musician Darwin Smith.  In the studio we transformed a pretty simple acoustic guitar and vocal song into a trancy, hypnotic, hard hitting 9 minute psych rock song about a bombing of civilians in Syria.
Your funding will help me uncover the magic that is underneath my songs and release that magic to the world.  It is needed.
Its all about you Huh?
Nope.  I have created some really cool gifts as a thank you for donations of all sizes.  More will be added as the month of fundraising progresses

<p>We currently have 5 days in the studio scheduled, with several days of prep work planned in advance to ensure we maximise our studio time. Unfortunately, this can get quite pricey; up to £1,000 for the studio time alone!</p>
<p>So initially, we are looking for £850. This will cover 80% of the studio fees with the band members set to cover the last 20%, plus some extra fees (IndieGoGo need a little something something!) will be covered in the initial costs.</p>
<p>This ultimately ensures we can do all our studio days we have booked and hopefully make our 5 track EP available for download! But they say the sky's the limit and that's where we are aiming so...<br/><br/>IF we exceed our expectations and get more than we need, we will be prioritizing a full physical release of the EP!

<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p>My name is Jordan. I am an actor, dancer, choreographer, director and filmmaker from Edmonton, AB. I come from a traditional Chinese Canadian family and grew up dancing. I studied musical theatre after high school and have been performing in musicals around Canada for the past 5 years, Most recently I was at the Charlottetown Festival where I met Alicia Toner, who is an incredible artist and her music is undeniably amazing.  From the first time I heard her music I wanted to create a dance concept video for one of her songs, and when I asked Alicia about it she told me about her new single she was releasing in 2019 - ""Dangerous Home"". This song deals with an abusive relationship and how hard it is to leave an abusive relationship when it's all you've known. This piece is extremely important to me because I feel it is an issue that needs to be talked about. I truly believe in doing things that can be terrifying. For me, that is putting my own artistic vision on an issue like an abusive relationship. Funding will push this project to the next level and allow me to really create what I have envisioned.</p>
</div><div><p>My goal is to raise $5,000 CAD, which will allow me to rent the proper equipment as well as the insurance coverage, plus pay the crew, cast and experts to film and edit this music video. It will also enable me to provide Alicia with a music video that she deserves. Artists should be compensated for the work that they do and any contribution to this project will allow that to happen. </p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Arts are such an important part of life as they allow us to feel things we may subconsciously block out. Art gives us an escape and a way to express ourselves. For me, music and dance have always been ways to embody the more complex emotions. We have all gone through some kind of mental health issue or have witnessed a loved one suffer. I feel that society is starting to realize the positive impact art can have for our mental health. By contributing to this project, you are aiding artists such as myself in telling the stories and expressing the emotions that most of society bottles up. Finally, I hope this contributes to Alicia's future as an artist; she needs to be heard.  </p>
<p>Thank you for all your support, and I hope you will contribute to this project that is near and dear to my heart.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Chad Matthews.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618854930/i8ihjyjx4wa6icdybygs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I'm a singer from Northport, Prince Edward Island, a small town in western Prince Edward Island, Canada. I am a single dad of four teenage boys - Joel, Nick, Zack, and Dylan. I fished for many years before taking a seasonal job as greenskeeper on a golf course in beautiful Mill River. I also play Canada's legendary entertainer Stompin' Tom in a dinner theatre in Skinners Pond, where Tom spent a few years of his childhood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616782041/nlgoy6clefzuyzs4ajpn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lately I've turned to singing Gospel music, although I still love to sing Tom's songs when I get the chance. I believe the world needs the kind of calm, peaceful healing that inspirational music provides.</p>
<p>One of my favourite devotional tunes is The River by Brian Doerksen. Its soothing, healing melody and message seem divinely inspired. I can easily picture a music video where troubled souls come to a river to ease their pain. My music seems to connect with people. It's humbling to know that some folks play my songs over and over, that their souls are calmed by my voice and the message of light I feel compelled to share with the world.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine a greater gift than sharing this light with others via a beautiful music video featuring Brian Doerksen's amazing song. Contributors to this meaningful campaign will be an essential part of this incredible gift. Thank you!</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Living in a remote area has its challenges. In order to make this meaningful video, I need to bring in some folks with special skills. I have an incredible team who believe in me lined up and ready to go, with a shoot planned for over two days in July. Funding includes labour and gear as well as travel and accommodation costs overnight for crew who live two or more hours away. Our goal is $12 000 overall; apart from cast and crew, this also includes an amazing award-winning cinematographer as well as licensing fees for Brian's song. </p>
<h3>Perks for helping me out will include </h3>
<ul>
<li>Signed call sheets from the shoot</li>
<li>A digital download card of my Gospel CD</li>
<li>Signed Gospel CD</li>
<li>Coffee time and signed CD</li>
<li>Campfire tunes with me at your cottage or home (P.E.I.)</li>
<li>Private concert with my band at your cottage or home (P.E.I.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, our team will come together to make a simpler video.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm so blessed in that I have played many shows over the years that affect people's lives in positive ways. Stompin' Tom's songs are a lot of fun to share, and sometimes my shows are energized just by playing cover tunes. But it's the Gospel songs that are really touching souls and making a difference in people's lives.</p>
<p>How Great Thou Art and Amazing Grace are staples in my live shows these days. They are truly changing lives, as I hear almost on a daily basis.  My band and I play at seniors' homes; it's incredible how touched these people are by the gift of music, and I am grateful to be the one to bring it to them. I heard recently that a troubled teen listens to my Gospel CD every day and that it calms his soul. Lonely people rely on it. I am incredibly humbled by the gift of music, a gift that started back in my childhood when I needed an escape. That escape became music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It seems everything is risky these days with COVID around. It brings unknowns into our lives. I believe this is the biggest risk. I was recently the main character in an NFB documentary film so I know what's involved in shooting an intense story-style music video. I'm comfortable on camera and am used to functioning with a busy crew around me. I know and trust the people I'll be working with. We'll have fun; we're like family, and I can't wait to work with those folks again. My boys will be in the video too - what a special memory we will be creating together in our own little part of the world.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi everyone, my name is David Galvan - also known as GALVN. I am a pianist/composer/songwriter. I’ve played the piano for almost 20 years now, and I need your help. A little backstory - I was born 3 months premature, and my parents didn’t think their one-pound baby would make it. They fought for me, and I fought to live. Among the various struggles, I didn’t talk until I was 3, but... music was my outlet. It always has been, and here I am today! It's been a blessing everyday to do music full-time, and I am truly grateful to everyone who has supported me.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to this campaign, doing a full length album has always been a dream of mine, and now, I finally have the chance to be able to do it with your help! I am currently finishing my final semester at my Conservatory with a major in Piano Performance, and once I finish, I will be working on my first full-length album. I have always wanted to create music that showed people what I've been inspired by musically throughout my life and that also told my life experiences. This album will involve some of my closest friends whom I have met through my musical journey, and it means the world to have them by my side. All of the funds will be going to producing, mixing, mastering, helping pay session musicians and any miscellaneous costs. With your donation, you’ll be able to choose between different perks such as a social media shoutout, a signed CD, a piano cover of your favorite song, one-hour piano lesson... I’ll even perform a piano concert at your house!<br/><br/>Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart to everyone who has supported me as well as my dreams over the years and to everyone who continues to support me! With your help, you will be helping me take the first step in achieving one of my biggest dreams. Anything and everything helps - even a share. I can't wait to share my dreams with you!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! I am so excited to announce I am finally making my FIRST EVER ALBUM!! Music has been my lifelong love and something that has healed me time and time again, and I'm hoping I can do the same for others with my music. I have the songs written, now I just need your help to get into the studio and bring my work to life!! :')</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This EP is going to be 4 songs, and every dollar earned will go towards production, mixing, recording, studio time, album artwork, streaming sites, etc. If I'm able to raise the full campaign amount, I'll be able to make a music video (which would be a literal dream come true!) but first things first:</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, I will be giving out 'thank you' gifts (check out the Perks to this project!) for your generous support. Whether it be one dollar or one thousand, I will cry happy tears and be eternally grateful. Your generosity means the whole entire world to me.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>I started my career as an 8 year old singing demo's and theme songs (such as Barney, Angelina Ballerina, Bob the Builder, etc.) for my dad in our in home studio. As you can imagine, these were some of my coolest and most special childhood memories with my dad.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know, my dad, Mark Williamson, is one of the most amazingly talented musicians, songwriters, and producers to ever exist. He's worked with some of the most extraordinary icons, including Freddie Mercury and Roger Daltrey. My dad has been battling advanced Parkinson's disease for the last 20 years and has been unable to make music or sing at all due to his illness' progression, so I want to finish what he started. Growing up around all of this shaped me into the person I am, and I learned so much about following your heart and perseverance through from my dad. He gave me this gift and I'm going to use it! </p>
</div><div><p>I can't wait to do this with you guys by my side! Thank you so much for your support, I am wholeheartedly and infinitely grateful.</p></div><p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>Danielle Rae Williamson</p></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Mike Randall &amp; The High Road</h3>
<p>Mike Randall &amp; The High Road have been making authentic country music around the state of Texas and surrounding states for the last 3 years and are proud to introduce their first full length album release entitled ""Bakersfield, TX"".</p>
<p>The record takes you from the deserts of the West to the swamps of the South, to the honky tonk sounds of Bakersfield, CA and the country and bluegrass sounds of Nashville, TN and Dallas, TX.</p>
<ul>
<li>HERE'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO I AM: I was raised the son of Baptist preacher, although music was just as much a part of our family foundation as anything else. In my adult life I've come to realize how blessed I was to be raised in such a musically rich family. With roots connecting to Billy Graham Crusades, churches and gospel music connections all across the country - it was a natural shift from Gospel music to Country Music for me. I was ready to spend the rest of my musical career in the church as a worship pastor but fortunately, God had other plans. After a rough divorce, my reality naturally became Country Music. With a handful of songs and broken heart, I started playing my songs and sharing my story to anyone and everyone who would hear. Thousands of miles later and close to 500 Live shows later - ""Mike Randall &amp; The High Road"" are picking up steam and poised to start making real waves in the Country Music arena. </li>
<li>""Bakersfield, TX"" is my story through song, and I'm awful proud of it.  We recorded the album at ""Acoustic Kitchen"" - produced by Milo Deering and co-produced by his daughter Scarlett Deering. Acoustic Kitchen was built and designed by country music legend Charlie Pride. It was a joy spending three days laying down the tracks that would become ""Bakersfield, TX"".  Here is everyone involved in the project:<ul>
<li>Mike Randall - Guitars, Vocals, Songwriter</li>
<li>Nik Lee - Lead Guitar (Texas Gentlemen front man and songwriter)</li>
<li>Scott Jenkins - Pedal Steel (Cody Jinks, and too many to name)</li>
<li>Ben Bigby - Bass Guitar (Summer Dean, RRM, etc)</li>
<li>Andrew Pederson (SouthFM and production guru)</li>
<li>Jenna Clark - BGV’s (Singer, Songwriter, Musician)</li>
<li>Milo Deering - Fiddle, Dobro, Pedal Steel, Mandolin (The Eagles, too many to name)</li>
<li>Scarlett Deering - Fiddle, Engineering (Zane Williams, The Eagles, too many...)</li>
<li>Mixed by Taylor Tatsch </li>
<li>Mastered by Justin Perkins</li>
<li>Art Work by Pecos McCool</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Cutting to the chase: The record is made, artwork is being made, but....we still have work to do, and it ain't cheap. Here are the basic #'s of what we are looking at.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixing &amp; Mastering = 2.5K</li>
<li>Physical Duplication (CD's &amp; Vinyl) = 2.5K</li>
<li>Radio Promotion = 1K</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have come a LONG way with this record. It's something we are all proud of and can't wait to share with you. It's a genuine tale of life, love an heartbreak - told in honky tonk style. </p>
<ul>
<li>Country Music needs this record, and so you do!<ul><li>We all know that the world needs more great, authentic country music.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>At every show people come up and thank us for the real music and real lyrics.</li>
<li>If my story can help one person get through their struggles, then this is all worth it.</li>
<li>This record will open doors for us like never before, in a very real way.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The good news is that we are so close to getting this baby brought to full term and brought into the world! The record is being mixed as we speak. The mastering guru is patiently waiting, and the Vinyl is warm and ready to be pressed - but this all takes money. As the Covid-19 pandemic took our main source of income away (live shows) our need for capital funds became very real, very quickly. But we have a plan, and this is where we need your help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the record comes back from being Mixed, it goes straight to Mastering.</li>
<li>Once we have the record in hand, we can begin utilizing our connections and resources to start distributing this album properly to radio and retail outlets as well as agencies and potential labels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ecuador's unique <strong>mosaic of habitats</strong> within, East and West of the Andes make it one of the most <strong>species rich</strong> regions on planet Earth. To give you some idea: approximately 20% of all the known 20,000 butterfly species can be found somewhere in Ecuador. And that's just the butterflies....</p>
<p>Each album sold includes a £5.00 donation to World Land Trust (WLT), who will use the money to help their conservation partners in Ecuador expand wildlife reserves in one of the most biodiversity rich regions on our planet, including Nangaritza Reserve in Southern Ecuador, where Nature and Culture International are establishing a protected forest corridor between the Andes mountains and Amazon lowlands, with protected areas for its indigenous Shuar communities. <strong>The more successful is this album, the larger the area of forest we safeguard for generations to come</strong>.</p>
<p>By the end of this initial phase of the project we will have raised a minimum of £5000. Once we've met our target the album will be more widely distributed, raising more funds for World Land Trust's forest conservation work in Ecuador.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>920 pre-orders of <strong>Tropical Forest Project: Ecuador</strong> in its physical format (album +  book) will enable us to make a simultaneous physical/digital release. That's how many pre-orders of the physical album will make it viable and affordable. This includes £2053 already pledged.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Book design is complete and ready to go. All we need is your order. The book is printed at high quality, so a minimum of 920 pre-orders means we can manufacture at a sensible price. It's as simple as that. <strong>***Please note: due to the varying impact of coronavirus on postal services around the world, although we will aim to despatch your copy of Tropical Forest Project: Ecuador on completion of the campaign, delivery times may vary considerably between regions***</strong></p>

***PHYSICAL RELEASE: our first two campaigns combined have raised 10% of the 1000 pre-orders we need - THANK YOU***
----
Mastered at Abbey Road Studios, Tropical Forest Project: Ecuador (album/book) is a spellbinding journey featuring exclusive recordings and songs from Grammy Award winning artists, a 20-piece orchestra, and hypnotic soundscapes recorded in Ecuador's magical cloud forests.
Your purchase helps World Land Trust's conservation partners in Ecuador expand Nangaritza Reserve, establishing a protected forest corridor between the Andes mountains and Amazon lowlands, and protected areas for its indigenous Shuar community.

Summary
Ginkgo Music's mission is to promote music as a force in forest conservation through projects linking music and ecology. We believe that music can play a part in shaping a popular culture that addresses our relationship with the natural world. 
Tropical Forest Project: Ecuador is our first release. It's an album accompanied by a 100 page book featuring lyrics, articles and wildlife photography. Each copy sold will raise money to permanently protect a bit of Ecuador's fabulous, mysterious and wildlife rich cloud forests.  It will be released simultaneously in physical and digital formats just as soon as we have 920 pre-orders of the physical product (book/CD). That's where you come in!
 

What You Get
A coffee shop acoustic experience, with forest soundscapes positioned between groups of songs, featuring 16 artists, including two Grammy Award winners, a 20-piece orchestra, dawn choruses recorded in Ecuador's cloud forests. 
An accompanying 100-page bilingual (English/Spanish) book features wildlife photography, song lyrics, articles from biologists working in Ecuador, and poetry from Mexican environmentalist Homero Aridjis and Cambridge astrophysicist Rebecca Elson. 
Perfect for you, someone you love, and our planet.

<p><i>The path of a heart that's true....""</i></p>
<p>My name is Richard Moody, and I am looking for support to complete the recording of a very special collection of songs.</p>
<p>The project is called ""Tobacco &amp; Rose', and is inspired by a journey that I have undertaken with different plant medicines. The songs have come to me in different ways, but usually they have involved working with a certain plant for physical or spiritual healing, resulting in the seed for a song. Add to this months of hard work, and the discernment gleaned from 30 years in music, and I have 11 songs that I am incredibly excited about.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have done all of the writing and some of the pre-production for this project, but have now reached the point where I need your patronage: funding for musicians, sound engineering, and the production of the finished product. Even in this age of home studios and digital innovation, it is still expensive to make a proper sounding recording. It can be stressful for an artist, used to the freedom of his own living room, to know the meter is running in the recording studio. And the best sound engineers and musicians often cost the most, and deservedly so. I want the sound production of this record to match the quality of the songs.</p>
<p>So in addition some private sponsorship and funds I've already saved, I'm asking for $15,000 to make this happen. </p>
<p>What do you get in return? Its up to you! You might choose a digital download, or you might want multiple CD or vinyl copies of the recording, or if you're wealthy, generous, or my mom, there are perks that allow for larger donations. Many different perk packages to suit your patronage needs ;)</p>
<p>Added bonus: you will receive video updates from myself and the band during the making of the record, an inside look at the creative process in the studio.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>It is my desire to pass this music on to the world as art, entertainment and medicine for any who can benefit. Music is medicine, as important as ever in this age of environmental trauma, extractionism, and digital distraction, and I hope for the energy of these songs to reach out in unforeseen ways to help heal an increasingly distressed planet and the beings upon it.</p>
<p>And if that all sounds too woo woo for you, fair enough! At the core of it all, I'm a seasoned songwriter that aspires to make a classic record that will be remembered as one of the great albums to come out of Canada!</p>

<p>We are a jazz trio based in Melbourne led by myself, pianist/composer ade ishs. This current line up has been playing together for over a year now in Melbourne and Bali—in 2018, we played at the internationally acclaimed Ubud Village Jazz Festival.</p>
<p>After a series of shows, it would be wonderful to document all the beautiful music we have played in the form of a new recording. Several years ago, I made a trio album that ABC Jazz picked as a favourite of 2013. Why not do it again?</p>
<p>You can be part of this, you know that? By giving us the financial help we need to make this a reality, you can get the benefit of becoming one among very few people that get early access to the recording! And the higher the level of your support, the more benefits you will also get.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get and What We Need</h3>
<p>If we meet our target, we’ll reward our backers (you!) according to the support level. Look at the unique perks we’re offering!</p>
<p>Now, what we need: I’ll make this brief. This project will go ahead as soon as we get at least $3,500.</p>
<p>If we can get more than the minimum amount we need, we will use the additional funding for more marketing and publicity. We hope that they will translate to more sales, which can also mean more recording in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Extra $1,200</strong> (total $4,700): A music video.</p>
<p><strong>Extra $3,700</strong> (total $7,200): A music video and a tour.</p>

<p>We have the winning team on board already!</p>
<p>Joining me on drums is <strong>Alex Roper</strong>. Anyone who watches the Melbourne music scene will know that she is one of the finest drummers across various genres.

<p>On bass, we have <strong>Rory Brown</strong>. Since moving from Sydney a couple of years ago, he has been highly in demand in Melbourne.

Other musicians Rory has played with include jazz vocalist Jill Barber (Canada), Charles Gayle (USA), Henry Grimes (USA), and Dereb the Ambassador (Ethiopia).</p>
<p>And myself, <strong>ade ishs</strong>, have recorded eight albums as a bandleader and pianist. Some musicians I have played with are Dung Nguyen (Australia), Geoff Kluke (Australia), Daigo Nakai (Germany), Benny Likumahuwa (Indonesia), Candra Malik (Indonesia), Reyharp (Britain), and Zamil Idris (Malaysia). I feel blessed to have gone to various places in Australia playing my original compositions in addition to making good friends.</p>
<p>Collectively, Alex, Rory, and I have performed at such respected venues as the Paris Cat Jazz Club (Melbourne) and Uptown Jazz Cafe (Melbourne), and prestigious festivals including Melbourne International Jazz Festivals; Ubud Village Jazz Festival (Indonesia); Wangaratta Festival of Jazz &amp; Blues; Eltham Jazz, Food &amp; Wine Festival; and St Kilda Festival.</p>
<p>In the engineering department, <strong>Allan Neuendorf</strong> is second to none when producing acoustic recordings.

<h3>The Harbingers </h3>
<p><i>To whom do the dead belong?</i></p>
<p>After the loss of both parents, composer Rosśa Crean dissected their grief through creation - and so came ""The Harbingers.""</p>
<p>Crean (and librettist Kendra Leonard) draws together mythical figures of various cultures to parse the nature of good and evil, their subjectivity in practice, and the gray area where humans reside and death has dominion.</p>
<p>Through this campaign, we hope to fund our basic production needs to bring this new work to life on Halloween night, when the veil is thinnest, in the heart of Rosehill Cemetery.</p>

<h3>Broader Impact</h3>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Metamorphosis </i></h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>A Celebration of  Humanity</i></h3>
<p><i>This event is an opportunity for people to gather from across the Middle East, North Africa (MENA) and around the globe in celebration of humanity through music, dance and art. This international festival will be held in the magnificent Wadi Rum desert of Jordan. Metamorphosis is the manifestation of a dream to gather international and local communities together to celebrate music, dance and art as universal languages of our shared humanity.</i></p>
<p><i>We will celebrate the portals of music, dance and art for two nights and three days with various workshops offered during the day. The first night will offer a lineup of electronic music. Electronic music uses modern technology to take people into trance through rhythm. The daytime will consist of workshops; think yoga, chanting, whirling, spoken word, and intentional movement. The second night will be more relaxed with the ambiance set with traditional, regional music. </i></p>
<p><i>Food is an essential part of connection and so food will be sold from the lodge as well as from vendors on site at designated times to encourage attendants to break bread together. </i></p>
<p><i>This is not a for-profit endeavor. Metamorphosis is an opportunity to gather community. Participation will not be dependent on the ability to purchase a ticket. Tickets will be distributed in 4 ways: for sale, donation-based, free to those who send in a 3 minute video about how they can contribute before, during or after the event and spots reserved for partners. </i></p>
<p><i>This ticket distribution plan is designed to curate an audience that is invested in participating, not only financially but consciously. Metamorphosis will require each attendee to bring their best and have their best fed by the rest of the gathering. Together we can build something better than the sum of its parts. </i></p>
<p><i>This event is called Metamorphosis based on the concept that we are the imagining cells of the great butterfly, and those of us that can see the future can lead the way into it. </i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Creativity + Community  = Collective Coexistence</i></h3>
<p><i>The surrender of dance can be medicine for the heart and mind. A way to connect to other, outside of speech and language. A culture’s dance and music hold a lot of that culture’s identity and through these portals we can understand each other from the inside out. When we dance to the same music we synchronize heartbeats and when our hearts beat to the same rhythm we can find unity. The continual and repetitive beat of a drum has been used across time and region to gather people into unified trance. It has historically been used as a way to gather people into a shared experience.   </i></p>
<p><i>Metamorphosis is the outcome of deep inspiration that landed as I traveled through Jordan in 2017 and 2018. The heart of the idea is to gather regional and international communities to come together inside the universal languages of music, dance and art transcending division into evolutionary transition. </i></p>
<p><i>During the two and a half years that the idea has been in development I have been in conversation with as many people as I can about how to create a relevant event that supports new paradigm consciousness in the region. I have spoken to people from Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt, and Kuwait about this and have found great enthusiasm for it among various groups of people. In fact, I have been told that this is something that is missing and that a place to express and explore new ideas freely is needed and would be welcomed. The trend towards music festivals in MENA is growing rapidly. </i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Partners and Participants</h3>
<p><i>The Metamorphosis team is collaborating with individuals and communities across the region and the world. Metamorphosis will feature DJs from throughout MENA, Europe, the US and Canada. The intention is to bring various populations together to trance into a unified space as well as musicians sharing identity through music. As the saying goes, you can understand someone better if you walk in their shoes. What would happen if we danced to each other’s music? </i></p>
<p><i>The origin of the artists, musicians and other creative contributors will not be advertised. Metamorphosis is a platform where nationality is not emphasized as to not exaggerate differences but celebrate shared humanity. English will be the connective language. </i></p>
<p><i>The majority of participants will be regional as the goal of this event is to bring people of the region together in celebration. Although, international partners are encouraged to advertise in their communities and bring their fan bases. </i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Wadi Rum, Jordan</h3>
<p><i>This will be a private event at Beit Ali, a beautiful, humbly luxurious contemporary, Bedouin camp. The arena on premises can easily hold 1,500 people and the camp can accommodate 2,000 total. The walled-off encampment can accommodate 300 people sleeping on site. The rest of the guests will need to stay in other camps around Wadi Rum (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) or neighboring communities or Aqaba (a large city on the Red Sea about 50 minutes away via a three lane highway.) </i></p>
<p><i>Jordan is an amazingly beautiful and an easy place to travel due to the many historical and geographic sites. Jordanians are welcoming, friendly and hospitable, the country is politically stable, clean and equipped with modern infrastructure. The Hashemite Kingdom is respected and appreciated by the Jordanian people and is considered legitimate and competent by regional and international leaders. The festival will be developed in a way that adapts to the cultural norms of the region.</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Bio</h3>
<p><i>This project is a result of my ongoing work on various humanitarian initiatives in the Middle East since 2001. My undergraduate degree is in Journalism and Ethnic Studies and my graduate work investigates Cross Cultural Communication and Human Rights in MENA. </i></p>
<p><i>I have danced throughout my life and around the world. And have learned most from those who have shared their cultures and traditions with me through the sounds of their music and the steps they use to synchronize heartbeats. I recognize the power that sound has to trance audiences into a collective of unified heartbeats. </i></p>
<p><i>As a participant in the inaugural Nablus Arts and Culture Festival in 2016, I recognized the ingenuity of abandoning politics and replacing it with art, music and dance as a mechanisms to bridge cultural divides. </i></p>
<p><i>Throughout my travels and inside of festival culture, I have been inspired by the power and potency of internationals coming together from around the globe to play in environments that celebrate diversity through creative collaboration. </i></p>

<h3>Josh Lane &amp; the Heartfelt</h3>
<p>My name is Joshua Lane and I have been writing songs since I was a kid. I wrote my fist song when I was 10 years old and it is probably the cheesiest piece of music that you will never hear. It's one of my moms favorites! I recorded my first solo Ep in 2012 and it was entitled Beautiful Beginnings. The title was important to me because it signified a ""beautiful beginning"" to a career in music. A year later I met the band while attending William Jessup University for a degree in Music. Writing music alone is a great experience, but writing music with some of your best friends is priceless! I came up with the band name recently and feel that it accurately describes what we are trying to do here. We are writing Heartfelt music folks! and we hope these songs become the soundtrack to new found love and life.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<ul>
<li>We need 7500 to make this record happen!</li>
<li>3500 of our goal will cover the cost of booking the studio and the engineer for six days of recording.</li>
<li>the rest of the budget will cover the cost of mastering, distribution, securing merchandise, traveling cost, photography and video.</li>
<li>We set this campaign up in such a way that you can help whether you are a college student or a business owner! EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS!</li>

<p>Money is not the only valid source of help in this campaign! Your voice and your social presence are very useful!

<h3>Smooth Stones</h3>
<p>Earlier this year, someone spoke to us about five smooth stones. In the Bible, David used simple stones and his sling to defeat a great enemy and bring about the deliverance of a nation. For us, our stones are songs, and to think that God might want to use them to bring freedom to people amazes us continually.</p>
<p>So, for the first time ever, we are recording an EP...</p>
<p>We are currently in the process of recording around 7 songs, and will choose 5 to be on this EP!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>AMAZING news is that we already have a portion of the finances we need to get this off the ground - praise God! </p>
<p>However, we still need some help to see it completed.</p>
<p>We hope to raise £3000 to help cover the costs of recording, mixing, mastering, manufacturing and all the other extras that projects like this need. Feel free to contact us if you'd like to see an exact breakdown of these costs.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our heart's desire is to take songs which have been written by us and see them released into the nations. We love to see God move as His children worship Him - to see Jesus liberate people and set captives free. God is so worthy of our worship, and it our joy to give our lives for the glory of His name.</p>
<p>Compelled by a desire to see a wave of freedom sweep across the earth, we will also be donating 10% of all CD sales to help charities who are fighting to end human trafficking, forced prostitution and injustice. Such charities will include:</p>

Thank for reading this far about our project!!! I just want to give you a little background about how this even came to be…. Liz and I have been friends for over 20 years. </p><p>I recorded my very first first cd ""Life Just Goes On"" in 2001 at Mr. Smalls Recording Studio’s first location in Millvale, before Liz and her husband Mike bought the church and turned it into Mr. Smalls Theatre, a state of the art venue that is a destination for many top tier touring musicians. I have also recorded my most recent full length CD and part of my EP at the new Mr. Smalls Recording and Mastering Studio, located in the Northside. I completed my video internship with Creative.Life.Support at Mr Smalls Theater in 2014. Since then I have worked with Liz at ""We Rock Workshop"", a program she designed with Allegheny County Department of Human Services, to help young aspiring artists in foster care compose their own songs, record a cd and perform them live in front of an audience, both at Mr. Smalls Theater and at some conferences around the state.</p><p>The first time I ever heard ""protest music"" live and in person, was when local peace activist Vincent Eirene was protesting the development of ""autonomous flying vehicles"" outside of Wean Hall at Carnegie Mellon university. We know these devices today as drones, and they do, as he feared, drop bombs on people. The protest music was provided by Liz Berlin and her band Rusted Root. Their message of love, peace and tolerance was one which really struck home for me. It was amazing to me that you could sing out against the war, against intolerance, against destruction of the environment. That you could actually sing for peace, understanding and have a deeper message was just so inspiring for me.</p><p>I feel like both of us are extremely committed to justice work through art and activism. Liz’s work with youth through the We Rock Workshop and the Real Life Music Camp has given me the confidence and empowerment to reach out to and share my knowledge with the next generation. This album is a culmination of 25 years of friendship, professional collaboration, mentorship and shared belief in a world where we can fight for justice, promote love and peace, and help defeat fascism through dance tunes.</p><p>One love, for we are one people, Phat Man Dee</p><p><i><strong>FROM<i> LIZ BERLIN:</i></strong></i></p><p>My first memory of Phat Man Dee was wayyyy back in the early days when Rusted Root used to rent out warehouses and throw renegade concert pot-lucks that generated an under the radar cult following. When the frenzy of the night was over, when most people had left and we were cleaning up the space and tearing down equipment I heard a deep and compelling voice bust out an a cappella rendition of ""Wade In The Water"". This little girl had a voice that was grounded in the earth and the soul pouring out of her mouth just filled the room. Since then I have witnessed her become the powerhouse musician I knew she was destined to be, having made a name and quite a reputation for herself not just in Pittsburgh but internationally as a circus jazz chanteuse on a mission. I am extremely honored to be working with Phat Man Dee on this project.  I have greatly admired her passion, caring, and humanity in speaking up for and taking action for causes that resonate deeply with me, and I feel there is no better partner for me in this endeavor.</p><p>Taking a stand on these issues is not always easy, there are a multitude of perspectives and details surrounding every issue, and it is impossible to address every aspect of every situation. But we each have to look into ourselves and address inherent biases and whatever privileges we enjoy as Americans in whatever life situations we are blessed with. There are certain things that we know are just wrong, that cross lines humanity should never cross. We know there will be lovers, haters, devils-advocates and mountain-top-shouters. Our biggest hope is that our music will lead everyone to look deeply into their hearts to be the best person they can be, and treat others, regardless of personal, racial, gender, religious, sexual or political differences, with all of the respect each human on the planet deserves. Grounded in this intent, we dedicate our art to the betterment of society and the raising of the consciousness of humanity into the beautiful, happy, healthy beings we are meant to be. </p><p>In service, Liz Berlin</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What We Need</strong></p><p>It would be wonderful to include you as a partner in our creative process. And when you do become involved in this project with us, we can’t wait to fulfill the special perks that we've lined up for our supporters to get in return for joining us in this endeavor.  </p><p>Here is a break down of the reality of recording a studio album:</p><p>Studio time (even when you own the studio) costs money, like $60 an hour.... someone has to keep the heat on and the pay the water bill and engineers have kids and stuff.....We also want to pay the band... Musicians like to pay bills too, they like to eat and so do their children..... we are trying to compensate everyone fairly.</p><ul>
<li>Musicians pay - 14 musicians for an estimated total of 280 hours (approximately 20 hours per musician, actual times may vary, for example the guitars, bass, drums, piano will spend more time in the studio than say the horns or violin) at $15 an hour - <strong>$4200</strong>
</li>
<li>Donation to Pastor Deryck Tines and Lemington Gospel Chorale<strong> - $250</strong>
</li>
<li>Studio time - recording, mixing, mastering - 70 hours at $60 an hour (includes studio and engineer)<strong> - $4200</strong>
</li>
<li>Feeding musicians during recording sessions<strong> - $500</strong>
</li>
<li>CD Artwork by Danielle Robinson<strong>- $250</strong>

</li>
<li>Total budget requested -<strong> $16485</strong>
</li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Wonderful perks!</strong></p><p>We have some awesome thank you perks that include include VIP invitations to the cd release party to be held at the Funhouse at Mr Smalls, digital downloads, signed copies of the disc, online video chats with the Liz, Mandee and members of the band and private live streaming video from recording sessions, and if you want us badly enough, we will come perform the set of music at a private event of your choosing!</p><p>All donations above the fair market value of any perks received are TAX DEDUCTIBLE, due to the fiscally sponsored non-profit partnership of Phat Man Dee Productions, Fractured Atlas and Indiegogo! So anything above the value of gifts received that you contribute to this cause (the normal cost of buying a cd, or tickets to the cd release party) will absolutely be something you can claim on your taxes!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>We as musical artists, are making the statement that it's not ok to hate, that systemic and institutionalized racism is not ok, misogyny and homophobia is not ok, religious intolerance and open hatred of Muslims or Jews or Indigenous people or ANYONE’s RELIGION (or lack thereof) is not ok, war for profits is not ok, destroying the environment because of our fossil fuel addiction is not ok, making flying robots that kill people is also not ok!!! We are promoting a message of love, tolerance, and we are not going to be silent on matters of importance any more. Well, we have not ever really ever been silent, but we are REALLY not silent if we make a CD you can dance to!!!</p><p>This is a CD that not only showcases the talents of the musicians involved, but also has a message. Our message is that we are NOT OK with the way things have been,  and we are not afraid to say so. We are capable people who can make the world a better place while we are here on earth. Our songs will be heard first by you, our friends, family and fans, and then they will spread, and the sonic vibrations of change will act on the world. We are not the only ones adding to the global choir of change, but we want our part to be heard and for others to know who we are and what we stand for. Disco dancing to songs which DEMAND justice, we will get bodies moving and encourage other voices singing along,  like prayer. We are singing and chanting for change. Please sing and dance with us! There are a lot of people in the world who need to know that we don't like the way things are being done and your support will show that you care to also make a stand.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>If we don't make the money we are hoping for..... we will produce this work anyways. Everyone involved wants it to happen and is passionate about bringing this album to life. We are committed to this project for what the message and music means. We are not asking for anything exorbitant, studio musicians typically get $40 - $60 an hour.  We can’t do much about reducing the cost of studio time or cd duplication, we can pay the studio off over time, a nice perk when one of the collaborators is an owner of the recording studio (but we still got to pay for it though....) Also, it is possible to reduce the cost of cd duplication by doing short run orders, but the quality of the final product is higher if we bulk order the cds from Discmakers. We would love to actually release vinyl, but that would only happen if the fundraiser did EXTREMELY well. So, while we do have ways to reduce cost, the biggest way is by just not paying any of the musicians in nothing more than love and pizza, and not to disparage love and pizza, both are sacred things, but really, who wants to work for free?!?? We've all spent decades learning how to do what we do, and we're good at it. It's ok for us to want to consider that musicians deserve compensation. </p><p>Every single contribution is so important. Whether you can only give $5, or if you can give $5000, the coming together of so many beautiful people to help us create a body of musical work means so much!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!!</strong></p><ul>

Like many, music was an escape for me from my daily frantic and terrifying life. As a teenager I realized how much power music had over me, I began to follow the lyrics in the songs and following the musician’s lifestyles. I ran into great disaster as a result. After a failed suicide attempt I started tapping into my creativity more than ever. I started asking God what was my reason for existing, and he answered. Once my ability to sing began to unfold I knew I had some strange power that was contagious. I started thinking of how I wanted to stand on a stage in front of thousands and sing the song of justice, freedom, and truth. I knew I had to help drag people from the dark pits of their anger, bitterness and doubt, so that's what I set out to do. </p><p>  <u>    <strong>My campaign is raising money to</strong>:</u></p><ol>
<li>Empower people with music that heals.</li>
<li>Make very high quality recordings with multiple different musicians.</li>
<li>Make a musical compilation ready for radio, TV, performances, and your hands.</li>
<li>Make my dream become a reality :-)</li>

Like many, music was an escape for me from my daily frantic and terrifying life. As a teenager I realized how much power music had over me, I began to follow the lyrics in the songs and following the musician’s lifestyles. I ran into great disaster as a result. After a failed suicide attempt I started tapping into my creativity more than ever. I started asking God what was my reason for existing, and he answered. Once my ability to sing began to unfold I knew I had some strange power that was contagious. I started thinking of how I wanted to stand on a stage in front of thousands and sing the song of justice, freedom, and truth. I knew I had to help drag people from the dark pits of their anger, bitterness and doubt, so that's what I set out to do.       My campaign is raising money to:
Empower people with music that heals.
Make very high quality recordings with multiple different musicians.
Make a musical compilation ready for radio, TV, performances, and your hands.
Make my dream become a reality :-)

Voices plead for rain from Mt. Kenya (known to Kikuyus as “Kirinyaga” or “Place of Brightness”) and from God.

She recalls the water and growth cycles of the natural world and her own place within the stream of time. </p><p><strong>3: Fire—And the Hummingbird Says</strong><br/>One of Maathai’s favorite stories is of a hummingbird who tries to put out a forest fire using only the water she can carry in her beak, while the larger animals mock her. This song sets Maathai’s retelling of the fable amid voices of opposition, fear, or indifference to climate change. </p><p><strong>4: Wind—Three Sorrows </strong><br/>“Three Sorrows” focuses on the burdens women carry and their struggles to confront men in power. It draws its inspiration from the sit-ins by mothers of political prisoners in Kenya that Maathai joined, as well as the misogyny she and other women undergo every day. </p><p><strong>5: Void—Dark Matter</strong><br/>Maathai chose to be cremated in a coffin of hyacinth (an invasive species), papyrus, and bamboo (both renewable resources), rather than wood. “Dark Matter” explores the life-giving properties of womb-like soil and the cosmic material that is most of the known universe.

<p><strong>Salt Wizard</strong> is an alt-rock/dream pop band out of West Sacramento.  SW formed in 2012, following a fortuitous New Year’s Eve party where pianist Rachel Warren’s lyrical harmonies collided with guitarist Eric Warren’s inventive songwriting.  The band quickly expanded to include eclectic drummer Anthony Ordonez.  Brett Hart upped the band’s rock energy, joining on bass in 2016.    </p>
<p>Salt Wizard is fresh from recording at Riverbank Studio and anticipating the release of our sophomore album “Creature Sounds” in Fall 2017.  Long-time listeners can look forward to a high-energy album that retains the band’s signature melodic beauty and lyrical introspection. </p>
<p>With your help, we can finish mixing, mastering, and producing our new album!  Music is a passion, and we’ve worked through full time jobs, second jobs, school, pregnancy, and the birth of our biggest fan to bring this passion to life.  Be a part of the process and product!    </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Creature Sounds needs $3000 to come to fruition.  While we’ve already recorded most of it, we need to reimburse our engineer for his recording and mixing time, then need to get it mastered and produced, and it’ll be ready for you!  We are budgeting $1500 for our engineer’s studio time and mixing, $650 for mastering, $600 for initial production, and anything past $2750 will go towards filling more pre-orders!      </p>
<p>To help us meet our goal, you can pre-order the new album and get all sorts of Salt Wizard gear!  We have stickers, t-shirts, a limited edition Creature Sounds poster, and our 1<sup>st</sup> album (if you missed it).  As a special perk, we’ll bring our music live to you!  Four wonderful donors can schedule us to play a private concert at their house, party, or event.    </p>
<p>Salt Wizard’s 1st self-titled album was released in 2014, and named #20 in SubMerge’s Top 30 Albums of 2014.  In 2015, we were awarded a Sammie for Outstanding Folk Rock, and nominated for 2016 Outstanding Folk Rock and 2017 Outstanding Indie.  SW was featured in articles in Sacramento News &amp; Review and Sacramento Magazine.  The band performed on live radio for 90.3 KDVS Davis’ “Live in Studio A” and 90.9 Capitol Public Radio’s “Insight”.  During 2016-17, Salt Wizard played our biggest shows at the opening of The Barn in West Sacramento, Sacramento’s Concert in the Park series, and the R Street Block Party. </p>
<p>Listeners count on Salt Wizard’s intriguing and catchy harmonies, thought-provoking lyrics, and musical honesty; whether joining local festivals, rocking a house show with sharpie tattoos and wizard trivia, or creating a chill vibe at one of Northern California’s microbreweries.  Whatever the venue, audiences anticipate the band’s self-described sound: magic from the depths of the river. </p>

It’s vulnerable and honestly it's scary! But this project has already been the most empowering experience in my life yet. I’m excited for the future of the show and I believe in it and the message and will tell this story no matter what we raise.  So, please, vote with your dollars, and know that every dollar counts. Other Ways You Can HelpI am not only accepting financial contributions. If you do not have the means to contribute I totally understand and please do not feel bad for one second, for I too, am a struggling artist! What would mean just as much to me would be a kind note of support and encouragement. Or find me on social media and start a conversation. I’m here. Thank you for your time, love and support. Please share this with friends and family who you think would be interested and joining the conversation. All of my love and gratitude, Lexie xx.girlboundshow@gmail.comig: @the_lexxfileswww.facebook.com/lexlowell",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF...</h3>
<p><strong>My name is Susannah Adams. </strong></p>
<p>I am a jazz vocalist and have been working professionally here in Victoria, BC for the past 8 years. Over the course of that time I have collaborated with some of the best jazz musicians in the region. I have explored my own musicality greatly and have worked consistently to develop my true voice.</p>
<p><strong>Jazz is the perfect niche for me.</strong></p>
<p>Each time we gather together to play, the tunes take on their own journey and unfold differently. There is so much room for improvisation! I adore playing around with the melody or rhythm of the song, feeling the flow of inspiration from the musicians I'm playing with, and working off it to create something unique and exciting.</p>
<p><strong>There's a special alchemy that resides in music. </strong></p>
<p><strong>That is exactly what I wish to portray in my album - the magic that lies in the moment.</strong></p>

My name is David Bryan.</p><p>Some of you have heard of me, but most of you probably haven't. In 2014 I performed what was arguably a groundbreaking concert of dead tunes in a highly recognized Romanesque style church on Park Avenue. The evening was magical, the hippies were well behaved, and a great time was had by all.</p><p>As a result of this concert, doors have opened up! I recently approached another NYC church in Harlem, that has an active underground vaulted stone Gothic crypt where they host musical events on a regular basis - mostly classical and jazz. I told them about the concert at the Park Avenue church and pitched the idea of doing a similar concert in their space. They agreed!</p><p>So, on Monday June 5th we will present: ""Live from the Crypt! Songs from the Dead, Sung for the Dead!""</p><p>The downside: we have to rent this unique space, which comes at a high cost for the evening.

I'm also planning to have it professionally filmed for free streaming online. Add to this all incidental and unknown expenses and this concert is going to cost over $10K.</p><p>Due to fire department regulations, this crypt can hold only 49 bodies at any given time, making this a super exclusive event! I have 8 musicians total, and 4 on my film crew, which leaves a mere 37 tickets. The upshot is that this will be an incredibly intimate, VIP experience for those who are able to get tickets.</p><p>The purpose of this fundraiser is to ""level the playing field,"" so that it isn't ONLY people with DEEP pockets who get a chance to be there! Basically, I'm looking to raise enough money in donations that we can charge a reasonable price for tickets.</p><p>HOWEVER: keep in mind that your donations are supporting a professional grade quality video/audio recording of the evening which will be posted online for absolutely free. I just want to share the experience with all of my fellow music fans!</p><p><strong><u>MY WISH</u></strong>: I'm fairly certain this has never been done before. My hope is that enough of you will say ""Wow, what a cool idea! I can get behind the concept and support that!"" At least just enough of you that I don't have to pay out of pocket to put this amazing concert on! I have raised 25% of the total cost, so all we need is $7500 for me to break even. (I'm in this for the music, not the money!) Can 75 people give $100? DONE. 750 give $10? 75,000 give $1? SEE HOW THIS WORKS???</p><p><u><strong>MY DREAMS COME TRUE</strong></u>: It is my dream that a large number of you will contribute a small amount such that we can do more than one performance in the crypt, thus opening the doors for many more of you to come share the experience in person. ANYONE UP FOR A WEEKLY CONCERT SERIES??</p><p>More than anything though, I have this one concert to pay for.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! </p>
<p>   My name is Drea and I'm a singer/songwriter currently residing in Los Angeles CA from Salinas CA. I started singing at the age 5 and playing guitar at 9 years old. After my uncle taught me ""Soak Up The Sun"" by Sheryl Crow,  my dad decided to get me into classical guitar lessons to get my mind off of my parent's divorce. I took classical guitar lessons for 7 years and used songwriting as a therapeutic outlet during that time. Throughout those years back home, I don't remember a time I wasn't in a band or where I didn't take music seriously.</p>
<p>Vulnerability is the most important element in being an artist. Though I've done music for so long, I've struggled with the ability to open myself up in the music I write. I've experienced so much as a person and artist the last three years in LA. This time in my life, I've never felt more than ready to share this side of me. </p>
<p>This Indie Gogo campaign is to help fund my debut EP ""Sharp Tongue"". I've never had the confidence to release a project that was fully written, recorded and produced myself. As much as I LOVE collaborating with other artists/producers/songwriters, I've always wanted to fully express myself sonically in the songs I write. I've never had the chance to release a record of my own that fully conveys my honesty and what I've experienced. As I've been evolving as an artist and a person in one of the world's biggest music cities, I fight for the person/artist  I want to be. </p>
<p>Although I'm producing this project on my own, I still need funds to deliver a quality project that includes: mixing, mastering, music visuals and most importantly marketing. Without this fundraiser, I would not be able to share this project with the world! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing this to be a quality project/product, I need $8,000 to make it happen! Those who donate a certain amount will receive either a cool dad hat, personal post card, handwritten lyrics, a limited edition physical copy of the EP, a digital download before anyone else hears it or a house show! Travel and lodging not included and would need to be accommodated. </p>

<h3>Strangers, friends, and family,</h3>
<p>A little wiser than I used to be, I've come to understand the nuanced and overt obstacles facing independent artists in the modern age. The hustle, the aesthetic, the networking, the online presence, the shameless self-promotion--all of which took going through years of trials and tribulation and confronting my own ego at every bend in the road. </p>
<p>Most apparent out of all of this strife and hardship, I've learned that, as much as I'd not like to admit it, I can't do it all by myself. Songwriting for me isn't just a full-time job, it's my craft and passion in this life. It's what gives me energy to face the world and the ability to love it. But as any serious independent musician knows, it takes more than a good song to get what you want in this industry. </p>
<p>That's why I've turned to crowdfunding. It's a direct engagement between myself and the people I make art for. It offers the potential to create art without compromising with the bureaucracies of ""the industry"". If my goal is met, I would be able to give you a pure depiction of my artistic vision for this album with unadulterated freedom. Which, for me, is very important and something I hope to maintain throughout my entire career. </p>
<p>For my goal, I chose a figure both modest (comparatively) and able to cover the cost of creating what will be my best sounding record  to date. The expenses include studio time, engineer cost, mixing cost, mastering cost and distribution costs. The ultimate goal is to be able to create a subjective masterpiece for $8,000. Or at least, the closest I get to that. </p>
<p>Please take a peep at the video above and a look at the list of perks you will get for your dollar donation. Thank you for taking the time to read and listen and for your donation. There's no greater satisfaction than being able to say, ""we did it together"". </p>

Songwriting for me isn't just a full-time job, it's my craft and passion in this life. It's what gives me energy to face the world and the ability to love it. But as any serious independent musician knows, it takes more than a good song to get what you want in this industry. 
That's why I've turned to crowdfunding. It's a direct engagement between myself and the people I make art for. It offers the potential to create art without compromising with the bureaucracies of ""the industry"". If my goal is met, I would be able to give you a pure depiction of my artistic vision for this album with unadulterated freedom. Which, for me, is very important and something I hope to maintain throughout my entire career. 
For my goal, I chose a figure both modest (comparatively) and able to cover the cost of creating what will be my best sounding record  to date. The expenses include studio time, engineer cost, mixing cost, mastering cost and distribution costs. The ultimate goal is to be able to create a subjective masterpiece for $8,000. Or at least, the closest I get to that. 
Please take a peep at the video above and a look at the list of perks you will get for your dollar donation. Thank you for taking the time to read and listen and for your donation. There's no greater satisfaction than being able to say, ""we did it together"".

<p>I want to show fellow musicians that you can make a difference and that you can get your music out there. The music industry has changed drastically, and I think for the better.

What better way to create your vision then to do it with the support of your family and friends?</p>
<p>There are always going to be risks and challenges. It has been such a learning experience getting to this point. What if people don't like my music? What if I can't meet my goal?</p>
<p>What if I fail?</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Hi everyone! My name is Kristin Trotta and I am a singer/songwriter from Boston who has lived in NYC for half her life. Music has been my life line for as long as I can remember. I have always dreamed of recording an album that represented me and being able to share it with the world. With your help, I can make that dream a reality.
So here are the nuts and bolts. In order to record the complete album and give my musicians the support they deserve I am looking to put a majority of the funds towards completing the album, mastering the tracks, and putting on a concert for a lucky group of you all.
Any donations are completely appreciated because it gets me one step closer to my goal.

<h3>At A Glance:</h3>
<p>Hey! My name is Samantha Selci. I've been performing as Selci for the last five years and have explored many different developments (including noise and ambient explorations) before settling on alternative pop as my medium. I have studied classical music in school, performed as a folk artist (and a burlesque clown!) and am currently a producer, comtemporary singer, and audio tech at Canada's storied National Music Centre.</p>
<p>This campaign supports the final steps towards completing <i>Effervescence</i>. It's incredibly important to me as this EP is my most meaningful creation yet, and makes use of the variety of skills I've cultivated over decades of practice. I have also been given the opportunity to collaborate with two of my idols on the mixing and mastering of this album:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sylvia Massy, mixing engineer extraordinaire, has worked with Johnny Cash, System of a Down, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, to name a few. She is one of my greatest inspirations as a woman in music.</li>
<li>Matt Colton, who has mastered the works of some of my favorite artists, including Blood Orange, James Blake, Coldplay, MUSE and a whole slew of others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with these two would bring the album to its best possible execution.</p>
<p>As it stands, this EP has been entirely self-funded, and, speaking candidly, I could not afford to have this album professionally mixed and mastered without your help.<br/> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Funding Required + Perks of Contributing:</h3>
<p>In order to complete this project, the final costs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately $1,000 to have Matt Colton master the album</li>
<li>Approximately $5,500 to have Sylvia Massy mix the album</li>
<li>$1,000 to $3,500 to have the album cut to vinyl. We anticipate doing a run of 100 records, with room to do up to 500 in a picture sleeve (!) when we reach our funding goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, we're looking for <strong>up to $10,000</strong> to finish the album in the best possible way.</p>
<p><strong>How can you support us?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We're using this campaign as a place to pre-order the EP. Whether you want it <strong>digitally</strong>, on <strong>vinyl</strong>, or even on <strong>cassette</strong>, you can pay now and receive the album as soon as it's done.</li>
<li>You can buy <strong>advance tickets</strong> for any of my upcoming shows this spring and summer!</li>
<li>We're also using this campaign as a place for you to shop everything Selci. We have <strong>t-shirts</strong>, <strong>stickers</strong>, <strong>posters</strong>, and <strong>patches</strong> available, with a bigger run of merch coming post-release.</li>
<li>There's some fun little custom-made stuff too, brought to you by yours truly – including an early screening of the music video I produced with <b>TELUS Storyhive</b> titled 'Truth in the Sea' and <strong>personalized love letters</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach 100% of our goal, we will compromise on what's most important to producing the album. We will keep our vinyl run to 100 copies to start, and minimize all other expenses in order to prioritize mixing and mastering. No matter how much we raise, the album will be coming out at the end of May.</p>

<h3>Why does <i>Effervescence</i> matter?</h3>
<p><i>Effervescence</i> is important as it has the potential to launch my career as a full-time musician, and to contribute to the Canadian music scene by exposing it to the world. This represents an opportunity to present my music in its purest and best form.</p>
<p>Since I first started performing as Selci, I have created impactful works with very little support. The last two music videos I've produced have very high production value despite their minimal budget, and have culminated in receiving <strong>$10,000 from TELUS Storyhive </strong>to produce my latest video for 'Truth in the Sea,' which will be releasing in early May.</p>
<p>Thus far, I have only ever worked alone and released a number of singles and albums. Working with a team has been immensely beneficial to my work. <i>Effervescence</i> will be a testament to that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
<p>Because this project is on the cusp of being finished, there are very few risks to consider. The primary costs are mixing and mastering, which will make a noticeable difference in the sound quality of the finished product. However, we still have the budget to bring everything else to completion.</p>
<p>The greatest risk is the potential for us to miss release day by having to source other mixing and mastering engineers who will fit our final budget. As it stands, our timelines established with Matt and Sylvia line up with release day, representing our best chance to release the best version of the album on time.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kyle and I'm a guitarist based in Memphis, TN. I basically learned guitar by playing in church, and a big part of guitar playing in church music is ambient. This style combined with my love of writing music lead me to start writing ambient background music. Up to this point, I haven't released any of it, but I decided I wanted to finally stop sitting on the music and get it out there. With this, I thought it best to put it under a different name than my own to separate the branding and leave my own name open for other projects later on. This project is going to be called <strong>Away From The Earth</strong>. To me, that encapsulates the goal of it: to take away from what is going on around you and allow you to focus, or just get away from it all. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With the launch of a new project and a new album comes cost. This is broken down into a few main parts. A good amount of this funding will go to the production so that the album sounds as good as it can. The next section is the distribution, which in this case will be CDs, getting the album into online stores, and <strong>a small batch of 7"" records</strong> (these will be in the rewards section as well). Branding for the new project will also be a decent part of this, the above image is a <i>rough </i>idea for the project logo. Finally, the last part of the cost will go towards a release event for the album (aiming for mid august). I'll share more details about that as it gets closer, but I'm extremely excited about it! </p>
<p>For rewards, this project will be slightly different than most releases for bands. I didn't want to do merchandise just because of the nature of this, but I did want to offer some physical and digital music options. The options will be: early digital release, CDs, 7"", and a combo CD + 7"" pack. The 7"" will be in a small batch, so if that's your thing you gotta jump on that! Also, any remaining physical copies will be sold at the release event. Finally, I'm going to share some behind the scenes videos with backers leading up the release of the record. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk is that I'm not quite finished writing the album. As of writing this, I am over halfway finished with it, but obviously that isn't finished. I do have all of the songs mapped out and started, all that is currently left is to finish them! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this campaign everywhere! It will help me out so much with reaching this goal. You can also follow Away From The Earth on Facebook and Instagram at <strong>@awayfromtheearth</strong>. The page is quite bare right now, but it will start to look much better as I move forward with this project. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Hello everyone, first of all, thank you so much for stopping by in my very first campaign for my absolute Debut Album!</strong></h3>
<p>My name is <i><strong>Giancarlo Monsalve</strong></i> and I am an open-minded worldwide performing Opera singer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560190575/hwtxcwnxs65kso9qk1as.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I was born in a little and humble house, full of cousins, aunts, and uncles in Valparaiso, Chile. Humble house but with the most amazing view! Today I live in Hamburg, Germany and. I am so thankful and honored for the path that life has already given to me as an Artist. Starting from being a kid with big dreams but no way out, onto a big twist in life that, with hard work and perseverance, transformed me into a worldwide Opera Singer.</p>
<p>Now in my 14th years of international career, I finally feel ready to put out my very first Album, with the freedom of independent production to make it exactly how I dream and feel it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><h3><strong>WHY AN INDIE ALBUM?</strong></h3></li></ul>
<p><strong>NOW, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME: </strong>I think that as an Artist giving and transmitting emotions is fundamental. If I do not feel chills of what I am performing or creating, how in the world would I be able to transmit that to you? Right? That's why<strong> I want this album to come out from here!!</strong> With no more attachments or compromises than with my feelings and my audience! <strong>You! </strong>In the end, this Album is for you and me, not just a business trendy machine of fast food like music, right?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<ul><li><h3><strong>AND WHO IS THIS GIANCARLO MONSALVE? What has he done before?</strong></h3></li></ul>
<p>I will try to make it as short as possible: With both feet on the ground, hard work,  love, and passion for the music, my career has developed all over the World in some of the most important Opera houses, always as principal guest Artist, <strong>Covent Garden in London, The Hong Kong Opera, Royal Opera House in Muscat, Arena di Verona, Washington National Opera, Zurich, Nice, Mumbai, Athens, Montreal, Munich, Seoul,</strong> etc. You name it. I was broadcasted in World cinemas, radios and TV with full shows and interviews! CNN, RAI TV, etc. I also had so many Interviews and notes in huge magazines as ELLE, newspapers as The Times, etc. <i>Featured in:</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560178163/zh6ig85btloapmkxalpy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And so on, working and growing with first-class level musicians, colleagues, Regisseurs and conductors. I was also really lucky to work with the Top voice-coaches (Masters) in the world, so many of them! I will mention just one here, <strong>Montserrat Caballé</strong>. I learned her superb legendary breathing technique in her Zaragoza Masterclasses. She was and will forever stay as one of the World Top Best sopranos. If you are not an Opera person for sure you will recognize her with the song Barcelona that she recorded with <strong>Freddie Mercury</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560177495/vlwstf4rtfbyueeohdrd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I am so thankful and honored.</p>
<p>I feel inspired by the Pioneer vision of so many great Artists as Montserrat Caballé and Freddie Mercury. That's why, with your help, I want to arrive to more people bringing this soul connected new sound with the Music of <strong>E-ARIAS</strong>, my Debut Album!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><h3><strong>THE ALBUM</strong></h3></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">10 iconic famous Opera Arias in a whole new concept. As I say it before in the Campaign Overview: E-Arias will be my absolute Debut Album.<br/>It is an extraordinary project that I have had in my heart for so many years now. As an Artist this project makes me feel like pure freedom because it will bring a fresh powerful new sound and vibes around. Mixing the best of two worlds Opera and Electronic music,<br/>E-Arias is pure music evolution!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561020899/aj5woxe2olvd3pglzpv2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This Album is not about someone who is trying to be an Opera Singer doing crossover music with basic technique and no experience.<strong> I am a real Opera singer, with a real career, </strong>using my years of experience to do this project for the huge love that I have for music.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li><strong>Inspiration:</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>E-ARIAS</strong> is a concept that I had in mind since 2015. It was not really clear yet because I was looking for that new sound that will touch my inner FIBRAS. Suddenly I had a call from a manager in New York to do the craziest project in my career: Stage, learn and perform the very first 2 hours and a half full-length Electronic Opera. It was as if the universe knew what I was looking for, and I did it! It was the E-Carmen concept and idea of a fantastic Lithuanian  Regisseur, <strong>Dalia Ibelhauptaitė</strong> and the mind-blowing music of <strong>Marijus Adomaitis (Ten Walls)</strong> production of the Vilnius City Opera, It was a blast!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">From that moment on I finally found compatibility with my concept, not a full-length Opera, but a full album with the most famous Opera Arias with this crazy wonderful blend of music evolution <strong>E-Arias</strong>. Pure power.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li><strong>Confirmation</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Dalia Ibelhauptaitė, the Regisseur of the E-Carmen that I mentioned before, and her Husband are the ones that, without really knowing, confirmed to me that this was the way. After a performance having dinner with Dalia, she told me ""this is the future of music!"" It is ringing in my head till today. Before that, her husband (you will know who he is) came to me after our premier and told me: ""Your performance moved me to tears, thank you!""</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I was so deeply honored that such an Artist was touched by my performance! What an Artist!<strong> Dexter Fletcher</strong>, the director that saved <strong>Bohemian Rhapsody</strong> and put it to the top movies ever, the same director that did now <strong>Rocket Man</strong> the life of <strong>Elton John</strong>. Trust me, he knows about performances!</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li><strong>Lucky again!</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Yes, I am! </strong>Just one month ago from now I signed with my new Opera Manager, <strong>Mr. Virginio Fedeli</strong>, who is also <strong>Andrea Bocelli</strong>'s Manager! So in our meeting in Bologna, I introduced him 2 projects to have his opinion and he just loves both of them! And one of them is the E-ARIAS! He told me ""It doesn't go against your Opera career, and I love it, so, GO FOR IT!”</p>

</div></div>","Hello everyone, first of all, thank you so much for stopping by in my very first campaign for my absolute Debut Album!
My name is Giancarlo Monsalve and I am an open-minded worldwide performing Opera singer.

I was born in a little and humble house, full of cousins, aunts, and uncles in Valparaiso, Chile. Humble house but with the most amazing view! Today I live in Hamburg, Germany and. I am so thankful and honored for the path that life has already given to me as an Artist. Starting from being a kid with big dreams but no way out, onto a big twist in life that, with hard work and perseverance, transformed me into a worldwide Opera Singer.
Now in my 14th years of international career, I finally feel ready to put out my very first Album, with the freedom of independent production to make it exactly how I dream and feel it.
 
 
WHY AN INDIE ALBUM?
NOW, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME: I think that as an Artist giving and transmitting emotions is fundamental. If I do not feel chills of what I am performing or creating, how in the world would I be able to transmit that to you? Right? That's why I want this album to come out from here!! With no more attachments or compromises than with my feelings and my audience! You! In the end, this Album is for you and me, not just a business trendy machine of fast food like music, right?
 
 
AND WHO IS THIS GIANCARLO MONSALVE? What has he done before?
I will try to make it as short as possible: With both feet on the ground, hard work,  love, and passion for the music, my career has developed all over the World in some of the most important Opera houses, always as principal guest Artist, Covent Garden in London, The Hong Kong Opera, Royal Opera House in Muscat, Arena di Verona, Washington National Opera, Zurich, Nice, Mumbai, Athens, Montreal, Munich, Seoul, etc. You name it. I was broadcasted in World cinemas, radios and TV with full shows and interviews! CNN, RAI TV, etc. I also had so many Interviews and notes in huge magazines as ELLE, newspapers as The Times, etc. Featured in:

And so on, working and growing with first-class level musicians, colleagues, Regisseurs and conductors. I was also really lucky to work with the Top voice-coaches (Masters) in the world, so many of them! I will mention just one here, Montserrat Caballé. I learned her superb legendary breathing technique in her Zaragoza Masterclasses. She was and will forever stay as one of the World Top Best sopranos. If you are not an Opera person for sure you will recognize her with the song Barcelona that she recorded with Freddie Mercury.

I am so thankful and honored.
I feel inspired by the Pioneer vision of so many great Artists as Montserrat Caballé and Freddie Mercury. That's why, with your help, I want to arrive to more people bringing this soul connected new sound with the Music of E-ARIAS, my Debut Album!
 
 
THE ALBUM
10 iconic famous Opera Arias in a whole new concept. As I say it before in the Campaign Overview: E-Arias will be my absolute Debut Album.It is an extraordinary project that I have had in my heart for so many years now. As an Artist this project makes me feel like pure freedom because it will bring a fresh powerful new sound and vibes around. Mixing the best of two worlds Opera and Electronic music,E-Arias is pure music evolution!

This Album is not about someone who is trying to be an Opera Singer doing crossover music with basic technique and no experience. I am a real Opera singer, with a real career, using my years of experience to do this project for the huge love that I have for music.
 
Inspiration:
E-ARIAS is a concept that I had in mind since 2015. It was not really clear yet because I was looking for that new sound that will touch my inner FIBRAS. Suddenly I had a call from a manager in New York to do the craziest project in my career: Stage, learn and perform the very first 2 hours and a half full-length Electronic Opera. It was as if the universe knew what I was looking for, and I did it! It was the E-Carmen concept and idea of a fantastic Lithuanian  Regisseur, Dalia Ibelhauptaitė and the mind-blowing music of Marijus Adomaitis (Ten Walls) production of the Vilnius City Opera, It was a blast!
From that moment on I finally found compatibility with my concept, not a full-length Opera, but a full album with the most famous Opera Arias with this crazy wonderful blend of music evolution E-Arias. Pure power.
 
Confirmation
Dalia Ibelhauptaitė, the Regisseur of the E-Carmen that I mentioned before, and her Husband are the ones that, without really knowing, confirmed to me that this was the way. After a performance having dinner with Dalia, she told me ""this is the future of music!"" It is ringing in my head till today. Before that, her husband (you will know who he is) came to me after our premier and told me: ""Your performance moved me to tears, thank you!""
I was so deeply honored that such an Artist was touched by my performance! What an Artist! Dexter Fletcher, the director that saved Bohemian Rhapsody and put it to the top movies ever, the same director that did now Rocket Man the life of Elton John. Trust me, he knows about performances!
 
Lucky again!
Yes, I am! Just one month ago from now I signed with my new Opera Manager, Mr. Virginio Fedeli, who is also Andrea Bocelli's Manager! So in our meeting in Bologna, I introduced him 2 projects to have his opinion and he just loves both of them! And one of them is the E-ARIAS! He told me ""It doesn't go against your Opera career, and I love it, so, GO FOR IT!”

Now I really feel ready for this adventure! Are you in?Let's produce this album together!
ABOUT BOCELLI:
(I do this mention especially for my colleagues and Opera purists) Everyone can say whatever they want about an Artist, but for me, Andrea Bocelli is an important culture contributor in the Opera world, why? Because he has brought more people to the Opera world than any of my colleagues today, and I simply love his work. Respect! Giancarlo Monsalve.

I grew up in New York and have come, mysteriously, to live in the heart of Austin, TX.  I began embarking on my singer songwriter journey when I was 21, when I discovered I could sing and had a talent for weaving lyrics and melodies together and performing them powerfully.  Before that I was known primarily for my gymnastics career of 18 years, and it surprised me as much as anyone when my life took a left turn in this direction.  A handful of years later and here I am at the foot of the mountain of a dream: to record my music excellently and masterfully, with some of the finest musicians out there, and give life to songs that have a real impact on people.  For the past nine years I've been writing and performing music, most recently with a five piece band here in Austin.  In 2012 I recorded my first EP The Wind, It Grew Legs, and later followed it up with a music video that has received awards internationally. I've been creating and refining this batch of songs for years and I am floored at the opportunity to finally bring them into recorded form.  When the producer approached me about working together, I knew it was my opportunity to really go for it!</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $10,000 to cover the cost of the studio, the producer, the musicians, mixing and mastering, album artwork, and the printing of CDs.  We are recording for four whole days the last weekend of August and the first weekend of September at a studio called Cacophony.  Musicians include members of my 5-piece live band Jon Clayton and Jacqueline May on guitar, cello, and vocals.  We will also have violin, viola, keyboard, pedal steel, bass, drums, percussion, horns, and additional vocalists.  Some of the finest musicians in Austin will be playing, some of whom have played on my favorite records, for reals! I am awed by how this is coming together.  The producer Grant Johnson has produced records of local Austin favorites the Deer, Ley Line, Dana Falconberry, and Raina Rose. I feel honored and blessed to be among such wonderful company!</p>
<p>In backing this project you are essentially ordering the album on commission, so if you've heard of us, heard us play or perform and have been touched by our music, please consider helping us fund this upcoming album!  You can receive perks such as CD's, T-shirts, tanks, tote bags and other cool handmade merch, original artwork, customized songs, and private live performances in your home! Righteous!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In a time of much global upheaval, divisiveness, and terror, music continues to be an unfailing source of comfort and inspiration for us all.  The title track of the album, Crystalline Charm is taken from a song that I sing at the end of live shows and therapy sessions that I host weekly at a local Texas jail where I volunteer with an organization called Truth Be Told.  Here is a sample of the lyrics:</p>
<p>I will pick myself up off the ground</p>
<p>Shake off the chatter and drowns out the sound of</p>
<p>Music ringing clear as a bell</p>
<p>Holds out its hands to lift us from hell and</p>
<p>Holds me up like a crystalline charm in the</p>
<p>Hand of a child so sweet and so warm</p>
<p>Makes me remember why I was born</p>
<p>Every time I forget</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's been my anthem lately and I hope, in its fully expressed musical form, it can be yours too</p>

Their lyrics speak of rural life in Nepal, the struggles of the workingman, and the resilience of the people’s spirit to deal with the harshness of every day life.</p><p>Night's debut album ‘Ani Ukali Sangai Orali’ released in 2014. It was well received critically and commercially and carved a niche for the band, with an audience spanning from metal heads, music connoisseurs and the common man.</p><p>Night represented Nepal at Shambhala Music Festival (UK) in August 2015. Night has also collaborated with A.R. Rahman (winner of two Grammy Awards) on the occasion of International Peace Day to produce a musical tribute <i>Ot</i>.</p><p><strong>About the campaign</strong></p><p>We are in the process of recording our second album ‘Jhalka Raya Buka’, which along with our studio session recordings, also features live field recordings from our travels. The songs in this album are reminiscent of the various musical practices across the country. Nepal has over one hundred different ethnicities and languages and the landscape changes drastically from the south to the north. This subsequently stimulated us to write and compose in diverse languages and dialects of Nepal. We have researched considerably in putting together each and every song of the album. Most of these songs were composed ‘in the field’ along with the people in the villages. After living with the initial melody and rhythm, we slowly discovered its deeper meaning through its compositional narrative. It is with this intention we express and share this music.</p><p>There are nine songs in the album that address various subjects but are thematically linked. The title track ‘Jhalka raya buka’ meaning ‘remnants of memoirs’ is based on ‘<i>thadi' </i>and ‘<i>deuda’</i> singing practices and performances from the western parts of Nepal. Another song, ‘Putali ko bhesha barilai’ is based on traditional wedding ceremonies practiced in the remote villages of Nepal. ‘Tharu song’ is based on the musical repertoire of the Tharu community where the verses of the <i>Ramayana</i>, an epic Hindu poem are sung. ‘Daanda kaada’ is inspired by mountain folktales that resonate on different levels, from faith to mythology to daily plight.

Their lyrics speak of rural life in Nepal, the struggles of the workingman, and the resilience of the people’s spirit to deal with the harshness of every day life.Night's debut album ‘Ani Ukali Sangai Orali’ released in 2014. It was well received critically and commercially and carved a niche for the band, with an audience spanning from metal heads, music connoisseurs and the common man.Night represented Nepal at Shambhala Music Festival (UK) in August 2015. Night has also collaborated with A.R. Rahman (winner of two Grammy Awards) on the occasion of International Peace Day to produce a musical tribute Ot.About the campaignWe are in the process of recording our second album ‘Jhalka Raya Buka’, which along with our studio session recordings, also features live field recordings from our travels. The songs in this album are reminiscent of the various musical practices across the country. Nepal has over one hundred different ethnicities and languages and the landscape changes drastically from the south to the north. This subsequently stimulated us to write and compose in diverse languages and dialects of Nepal. We have researched considerably in putting together each and every song of the album. Most of these songs were composed ‘in the field’ along with the people in the villages. After living with the initial melody and rhythm, we slowly discovered its deeper meaning through its compositional narrative. It is with this intention we express and share this music.There are nine songs in the album that address various subjects but are thematically linked. The title track ‘Jhalka raya buka’ meaning ‘remnants of memoirs’ is based on ‘thadi' and ‘deuda’ singing practices and performances from the western parts of Nepal. Another song, ‘Putali ko bhesha barilai’ is based on traditional wedding ceremonies practiced in the remote villages of Nepal. ‘Tharu song’ is based on the musical repertoire of the Tharu community where the verses of the Ramayana, an epic Hindu poem are sung. ‘Daanda kaada’ is inspired by mountain folktales that resonate on different levels, from faith to mythology to daily plight. Whereas ‘Gaine geet’, Kalo dhunga’ and ‘Basai bagayo part 2’ speaks about the struggles of the workingman, and the resilience of the people’s spirit to deal with the harshness of every day life.We have also worked with and revived some endangered traditional Nepalese instruments like ‘pilhru’, ‘kastaar’, ‘chatkauli ‘and ‘piwancha’ for our upcoming album. Research has been an integral part of our evolution and creative process. But this involves an enormous cost associated with travelling and staying in remote villages for a long duration.

<p><u><strong>Tour Needs and Your Perks </strong></u><br/>Leaving my family for a little over one month requires the love and support of my family, friends and new friends I will make along the way. More substantially, someone has to physically fill my shoes and take care of all the day to day needs of a household with two young children and a spouse who works full time. We take the care of our children very seriously as most people do. We have an incredible person to take care of our babies and manage all of the mundane tasks. To make this tour a success I also need a rental car (my 2006 Nissan Altima is fine but if it breaks down the tour ends; if a rental breaks down I get it replaced and keep it moving). Additionally, there is a need for a reliable GPS, food and gas money while on the road, a small fund for lodging in case I need to rest and have no friend's place to crash. Finally I will need a plane ticket home. Here you will find details on the tour budget with quotes and pictures: </p>

<p><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>Total Driving Miles - 4576mi (75+hr of driving time) This is a physical and mental challenge but nothing comes to those who wait and I refuse to allow my voice to be silenced simply because I'm an undiscovered gem. I will no longer be the seed that waited for something to happen. I have let go of my fear. I am breaking down the walls that divide us and coming to your city, I am truly bringing my music To The People!!</p>
<p>I announced this tour having no cities booked and we now have 7 booked with the goal of 15. My sister Victoria Beeson has been working to make this manifest along with her team of incredible talents. At the launch of this campaign we are negotiating with several others and working to make the vision a reality. The great news is that we are not being turned away. One of the biggest challenges we are facing is the time frame; venues are very interested and requesting us for dates that fall outside our date range or the driving distance is too far. This is a great problem because it means there will be more tours in the future. This is also a challenge because some of the venues along the path are already booked full. This gives a chance for those people in certain cities to invite The American Dream Tour to your city. Check out the dates below and link us with a promoter and venue in your city!  </p>
<p><u><strong>Social Consciousness*</strong></u><br/>Over the past two years under the current White House the true progressive nature of this country has been forced out of the shadows into the public conversation. In the wake of social movements such as #metoo #marchforourlives and #NoNato, major shifts have impacted Hollywood and the business world, leading to a blue wave taking over Congress and shifting the seats of power in Washington. Yet, much of mainstream music has continued to cater to an audience that identifies as less politically active. In a world where so much injustice exists those with a voice and a platform must use every means possible to help create a better world for future generations. The American Dream Tour is a wake up call for America. We can allow this country to crumble under the weight of our bloated military budget or decide to do our part in helping to eliminate greenhouse gases and thermonuclear weapons. On timeless tracks, Megaciph’s songs address looming global issues such as climate change, and pervasive social issues such as cycles of violence in communities and the prison industrial complex. Come to a show in a city near you and experience how your <strong><i>Mental Energies</i></strong> <strong><i>Gather And Circulate In Positive Harmony</i></strong><strong><i>.        </i></strong></p>

In the wake of social movements such as #metoo #marchforourlives and #NoNato, major shifts have impacted Hollywood and the business world, leading to a blue wave taking over Congress and shifting the seats of power in Washington. Yet, much of mainstream music has continued to cater to an audience that identifies as less politically active. In a world where so much injustice exists those with a voice and a platform must use every means possible to help create a better world for future generations. The American Dream Tour is a wake up call for America. We can allow this country to crumble under the weight of our bloated military budget or decide to do our part in helping to eliminate greenhouse gases and thermonuclear weapons. On timeless tracks, Megaciph’s songs address looming global issues such as climate change, and pervasive social issues such as cycles of violence in communities and the prison industrial complex. Come to a show in a city near you and experience how your Mental Energies Gather And Circulate In Positive Harmony.        
*Megaciph lyrics do not promote materialism, misogyny or violence of any kind.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi,  this is jazz flutist Kim Scott.  I'm a music teacher at a fine arts school for 7th-12th graders who want to pursue the arts as a career. I've taught for 18 years and I absolutely love giving back to the next generation of musicians.  I'm also a professional flutist; a member of the Tuscaloosa Symphony Orchestra, the Kimoni Duo (a flute and harp duo) and I'm a billboard charting flutist on the Innervision Records label.  I love music and the flute.  I've wanted to be a professional flutist since I first started playing in 5th grade.  I can't think of not ever creating music and putting it out into the universe. </p>
<p>I have created this campaign because I've planned and budgeted for the creation and release of my 4th album, ""Free to Be"".  Because of some wonderful opportunities presented to me, the costs of my project exceeded the budget I created.  I chance not being able to release this project on time and need your help to make it happen.  This music has to reach the world.  The past year I experienced some real life experiences that were detrimental and heartbreaking.  I overcame them and this music has breathed new life into my existence.  I want to share it with the world in hopes that it will inspire and bring healing. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help me create and promote this project.  I want to submit it to the Grammy Foundation for consideration.  It's JUST THAT GOOD!  I believe in this project and I believe in you.  Will you join my team and help me?</p>
<p><strong> What You Get For Helping:</strong></p>
<p>The project will cost roughly $12,000.  I am trying to raise $5,000 for recording at Woodaworx Studio, production, duplication and radio promotion.  I plan to use my savings for the bulk of it.  Here are the perks for your generous donation:</p>
<p>$50  and up - a personalized, autographed CD</p>
<p>$200  and up - a personalized, autographed CD and a Kim Scott's ""Block Party Radio"" t-shirt</p>
<p>$300 and up -  a personalized, autographed CD, a Kim Scott's ""Block Party Radio"" t-shirt, and a pair of tickets Kim's CD Release Concert in Birmingham or Huntsville, AL.</p>
<p>$400 and up - a personalized, autographed CD, a Kim Scott's ""Block Party Radio"" s-shirt, a pair of tickets to Kim's CD Release concert in Birmingham or Huntsville, AL. and a meet and greet there.</p>
<p>$500 and up-  a personalized, autographed CD, a Kim Scott's ""Block Party Radio"" t-shirt, a pair of tickets to Kim's CD Release concert in Birmingham or Huntsville, AL., a meet and greet there, and acknowledgement in the CD liner notes.</p>
<p>Even if I don't reach my goal, your full donation will be appreciated and will go towards this project.  My track record shows that you can trust me and my intent.  Just listen to any of my previous three records on iTunes, Amazon, CD Baby or Pandora.</p>

The Prince Ivan Concept
Once upon a time, two guys wanted to make music and change the world.We’re those two guys. :)Hi, we’re Prince Ivan and our vision is tobecome one of the most commercially successful duos of all time,writing and producing hit music for ourselves and other artists for many years to come.
The Prince Ivan concept is to create mainstream, profanity-free musicin a genre we call SpectraPop™️. Our mission is to create what we call SpectraCulture™️ by uniting people of all ages, races and backgrounds, especially targeting young people ages 13-30.

The Problem We See

There’s just too much hate and division in the world. We don’t like it.
This division and hate usually starts with one person,but then it gets into families, communities and nationsuntil it is eventually deeply engrained in our culture.Division and hate stinks.But, if we can change individual hearts, then we have a chance at changing the culture,which would decrease the hate and increase the love and unity.

Music Has Power

Music bypasses the intellect and goes straight to the heart.As musicians, we have a powerful medium to influence human hearts and shape culture.The problem is that a lot of musicians and artists use the power of music to influence the minds and hearts of our young people negatively, planting ideas that lead tomore hate, more division and more societal problems…

The Solution We See

But, imagine if we can create clean music that young people actually like!Mainstream, radio-worthy pop music that isn’t hoaky, cheesy or low-quality.Then, maybe we can gain these young peoples’ trust and our music could help plant better ideas in their hearts, which would impact culture in a very positive way and help create ourvision of a world filled with love, joy and unity—A SpectraCulture™️ world.Make sense?Enter, Prince Ivan and “The Preface” album…

The Music

Our musical approach is a bit different, so we had to come up with a new genre we call SpectraPop™️. SpectraPop™️ music…
…Is contemporary.…Contains appropriate content. …Blurs genre-lines.…Leads to SpectraCulture™️.In short, SpectraPop™️ is music for everyone.You can turn Prince Ivan’s music on and know you’re goingto get catchy, high quality and guilt-free music without the filth. Every time.
Our first full length album, “The Preface,” is going to feature SpectraPop™️ songs that aremore taste relevant and targeted at young people than any of our previous music.
You can check out some of the singles we’ve already released from “The Preface” by clicking here.Also, check out some of the YouTube videos in the gallery above.

The Tour

We'll be touring “The Preface” to high schools, collegesand cities all throughout the country in 2019-2020. We LOVE interacting with students, young people and fans. 
On stage and on tour is where our music, our mission and our message combine in the most powerful way and we really see hearts changed and lives touched.

The Movement

We are not the only artists who are trying to impact culturethrough good clean music and entertainment. There are many others. Our goal is to step up and be a voice for this movement, model the way, andultimately mobilize thousands of other artists to take the same approach,proving that you don’t have to ""sell out"" to sell out.We’re just one artist, but if we can mobilize others, then we can really shift culture.

The Money

We’re not in this just to make money, but it takes money to do what we’re trying to do.So, we are seeking a contribution of $10,000 to help us finish the album,launch the tour and get this clean music movement off the ground. 
This album has already cost much more than $10,000but we just need a final financial push to finish the music, createthe show and build the tour, so we can take “The Preface” to the world.

What You’ll Get

A lot of people do crowdfunding campaigns, but you can rest assured that your contribution is going toward something that will make a positive difference in the world—a cause we are 100% committed to.We promise that we will do everything we possibly can toput your contribution to good use in building the vision we’ve described.There are also some great perks.Check ‘em out!

The Time is Now

If we’re going to reclaim our culture and take back the arts andentertainment mountain, then we are going to need to take action.Now is the time. We feel like we’re at a pivotal moment in our history.We want to inspire the next generation to join us in creating a better world and we know we need to move fast.
We’re just two guys, but if you help us launch this, then we standa legitimate chance at shifting culture and doing, not just some, butA LOT of good in the world.

<p>Hello. I'm setting out here to raise funds to off-set the manufacturing &amp; promotional costs of my 2nd CD, Mighty Lopez-""Tales From the Wood"". I'm hoping you'll support me in this project by ordering a signed copy of the CD prior to its official release in May, 2017. I've chosen to go with an Indiegogo campaign as the best way to reach out to my fans, friends &amp; family, home &amp; away.</p>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>My musical journey has been down a long &amp; twisted road. From my early days in Halifax (Nobody's Heroes, The Cooter Family), to incursions into Vancouver (Hard Rock Miners) &amp; Toronto (Living Proof, The Wammee, Jughead) music scenes, to settling &amp; raising a family in Muskoka, music has been my constant companion. With my kids full grown, I've re-focused my attention back to doing what I love... making music!</p>
<p><strong>About This Project</strong></p>
<p>This project is the fruit of my friendship with George Axon. I met George four years ago following a chance meeting in Bracebridge, Ontario.  From part time seasonal side man, to sharing demos, to co-writing and ultimately producer extraordinaire, George is an integral part of this labour of love called “Tales from the Wood”.  Differing from my bare bones first CD ""Mighty Lopez"" released in 2013, each song on this collection has been allowed to suggest its own instrumentation and arrangement, allowing an independent, organic growth. The result is an eclectic assortment of songs and instruments that will keep you engaged until the last chord fades.</p>
<p>Among the prominent musicians who contributed to this work, I am especially proud to have had the opportunity to work with my big brother, Brigham Phillips, one of Canada's top musical directors, for the first time.  Other contributors include Aidan Mason, Ed Roth, Brad Smith and Jamie Sherman.  Sean Cotton also adds his musical as well as songwriting talents to this project.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>With no funding but an abundance of passion, the collaboration between George and I has consumed many months of blood, sweat and tears (and laughs), “Tales From the Wood” has finally come to fruition, with manufacturing underway.</p>
<p>With the CD scheduled for release in  May 2017, this campaign is intended to raise funds to off-set manufacturing &amp; promotional costs.  I am offering pre-release autographed copies of the CD for sale at $25 (shipping included). If you are able to contribute more, there are many other exciting offerings for you to choose from.  However much you are able to contribute, my gratitude for your faith and support for this project is boundless.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot afford a monetary pledge, your help is still needed, and very much appreciated.  Please talk about, and share the link to this page where ever you can – Twitter, Facebook, personal emails….getting the word out is so important. </p>
<p>To everyone who has taken the time to look at this, make a pledge, or spread the word – THANK YOU.</p>

The result is an eclectic assortment of songs and instruments that will keep you engaged until the last chord fades.
Among the prominent musicians who contributed to this work, I am especially proud to have had the opportunity to work with my big brother, Brigham Phillips, one of Canada's top musical directors, for the first time.  Other contributors include Aidan Mason, Ed Roth, Brad Smith and Jamie Sherman.  Sean Cotton also adds his musical as well as songwriting talents to this project.
How You Can Help
With no funding but an abundance of passion, the collaboration between George and I has consumed many months of blood, sweat and tears (and laughs), “Tales From the Wood” has finally come to fruition, with manufacturing underway.
With the CD scheduled for release in  May 2017, this campaign is intended to raise funds to off-set manufacturing & promotional costs.  I am offering pre-release autographed copies of the CD for sale at $25 (shipping included). If you are able to contribute more, there are many other exciting offerings for you to choose from.  However much you are able to contribute, my gratitude for your faith and support for this project is boundless.
Even if you cannot afford a monetary pledge, your help is still needed, and very much appreciated.  Please talk about, and share the link to this page where ever you can – Twitter, Facebook, personal emails….getting the word out is so important. 
To everyone who has taken the time to look at this, make a pledge, or spread the word – THANK YOU.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Neamen releases a daring project that pushes the boundaries of pop saxophone music. </strong></p>
<p>It’s been a while since the debut of my first CD, “So Free” and I decided that if I was ever going to release a new project for my fans, I had to bring them something that was genuinely worth the wait. As a performer, I go all in with everything that I do and so I knew that the only way I could do this project justice was to push the limit both inside myself and my art. The <strong><i>Moment of Truth </i></strong>is my breakout statement as a saxophonist, composer, rapper and lyricist that crushes the boundaries of a typical saxophone CD. I placed all my cards on the table to bring you something exciting, sincere, slightly dangerous and definitely NEAMEN. Get ready, because you are going to love this.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492629997/sqifdnx6prbmeybcooxs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I made this CD for everyone who loves real artistry and longs for the days when music use to mean something, when songs were about the sincerity of heart rather than corporate analytics. A time when musicians followed their inner spirit before the concern of their wallet size. I have assembled an extraordinary cast of inspirational singers and instrumentalists who will leave your soul touched. If I've said it once I might as well say it again, you are just gonna love this CD.</p>
<p>Like so many independent musicians, I am the sole financier of my artistic career and I need your support to keep it going. If you enjoy the music that I create, please partner with me so that I can complete this project and undertake others like it. The funds from this campaign will be used to manufacture compact disks, launch a national radio campaign and purchase high quality video equipment so that I can bring you live performances directly from the internet.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your kindness, encouragement and support, I literally cannot do this without you. As a part of my campaign, I have included several perks to show my appreciation and express my sincere gratitude. If you are unable to participate as a financial backer but still want to support the project, please share this page on your social media.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to record eight songs with one cover chosen by you. To do this we need to raise around $10K. If we raise more money, we'll do more. If we raise less, we'll do less. How much BSB do you want in your life? It's up to you!</li>
<li>With this we’ll be able to produce a full-length album, along with T-shirts, album art, and vinyl. If we raise more than our goal, the funds will be used to record more songs, for PR, marketing,  and all of the other business stuff that goes into getting an album out for the world to hear.</li>

<p>The idea of a crowdfunding campaign scared us at first. We've never done one of these. We thought, ""What will people think if we ask them for help?"" ""Is it going to look like we're begging?"" And especially, ""What if we don't reach our goal?"" </p>

<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>A Little Fire Scarecrow is a recording project by Coraline Ada Ehmke, a transgender artist working from her home studio in Chicago.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking for funding to cover production costs for this album:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring a professional violinist to add magic to the track ""Astronomy Domine""</li>
<li>Fees associated with securing rights to all of the songs on the album</li>
<li>Pay for the cost of releasing the album on iTunes, Apple Music, Amazon, and Spotify</li>
</ul>
<p>All supporters at the $10 or higher level will get access to a digital download of the entire album.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Transgender people have made great strides in recent years but we still face incredible obstacles to being fully integrated into society. All too often our voices are not heard, and people who don't understand our unique challenges and unique gifts misrepresent us in the media. It's important to empower transgender people to find their own voices and represent themselves in all spheres of life. This  includes supporting transgender artists who are creating important works that reveal our inner lives and inner struggles as we continue our journeys of self-discovery.</p>
<p>For myself, returning to making music was very difficult. Before I decided to transition my music was an outlet for the rage and sorrow that overwhelmed me, feelings that I had no other way of expressing. Once I began my transition, that creative center moved away. I really thought that without the existential burden of living a false life, I had no inspiration anymore. Over time I came to see that there was a new world of feelings to explore, new perspectives that I was gaining, and new stories to tell. Slowly and with difficulty I returned to expressing myself creatively through music.</p>
<p>Finding myself and finding the courage to live authentically continues to be the hardest thing that I have ever done, and in fact it is never done. I struggle daily with questions of identity, authenticity, and acceptance. Making music is one of the ways that I have found to center myself and find my voice.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><p>Even if you can't donate to help me release this album, please recognize the importance of supporting and amplifying the voices of marginalized people. Use your social media presence to promote the projects of people who are working to make the world a more diverse and inclusive place.

I struggle daily with questions of identity, authenticity, and acceptance. Making music is one of the ways that I have found to center myself and find my voice.
Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't donate to help me release this album, please recognize the importance of supporting and amplifying the voices of marginalized people. Use your social media presence to promote the projects of people who are working to make the world a more diverse and inclusive place.

<h3>Tell Me More!</h3>
<p>How <i>La Guerrera EP//The Warrior EP</i> came to be..</p>
<p>In case you don't know who I am, hi, I'm Gaby! 23-year-old singer-songwriter born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and a temporary Twin Cities transplant while I completed my Bachelor of Music in Composition and Songwriting at McNally Smith College of Music in St. Paul, Minnesota. I've been writing songs since I was 12 and performing regularly since age 14. I primarily play guitar and sing, but I also play mandolin, ukulele, and piano/keyboards. Between 2011 and 2015, I released three studio albums, and the most recent came to life with the help of Indiegogo, so I've decided to use this wonderful platform again to help fund this EP! It's been a while since I got music out to you and you deserve some new tunes!</p>
<p>So...how did these songs come to be?</p>
<p>While in college, for my senior portfolio, one of my requirements was to write a stylistic track (in other words, a song outside of my typical genre). I chose to pay homage to my Hispanic heritage and wrote a song called ""Guerrera."" This song, as the title suggests, is about being a warrior and knowing your worth. I was raised in a family of feminists and powerful women on both sides of my family, so it has always been instilled in me that I can do whatever I want and achieve whatever I want by my own means. Equality and justice are two words I heard a lot growing up. This is the first song where I've written lyrics in Spanish, and that was very empowering in itself.</p>
<p>The next song, ""Stronger,"" is actually one of my oldest songs that was on my first album but I'm re-recording it since it's changed a bit over the last almost 10 years. I wrote this song about one of my best friends who saved my life back in middle school. Sometimes in order to be strong, you have to let someone be strong for you. Friendships are absolutely essential in life and I wrote this song to reflect that.</p>
<p>""Thrill,"" lyrically, is probably the most risqué song I've ever written. This song touches on sexual empowerment, a topic I never saw myself writing about. But...it makes sense that my lyrical content would go through a change between the ages of 12 and 23! So many mainstream songs these days objectify women and I'm tired of that, so this song came from my own desires and passions, from the perspective of an empowered young woman who isn't afraid to chase after what she wants.</p>
<p>I started writing ""Goddess"" and ""The Fight"" the same night in June of 2017. It had been months since I'd written anything, and I had lots of ideas I needed to get out. ""Goddess"" came from a more vulnerable spot. The chorus is essentially a chant to repeat over and over when you're feeling powerless and defenseless. No matter what, you are a goddess. You can take care of yourself, persevere, and prosper. ""The Fight"" came from an angrier spot. A few people from my past caused a lot of psychological damage through bullying, manipulation, and other harmful acts. Lots of people tell me I'm stubborn and tenacious; I'm never down for long. That's exactly what ""The Fight"" is about.</p>
<p>Successfully reaching the goal for this campaign will allow me to get these five extremely personal songs out to you in mid-2018!! I want to leave about a year and a half between this EP and my fourth studio album, which is still being written.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the Bang for My Buck?</h3>
<p>Let me break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to get this EP out into the world and your hands/smartphones/laptops, I need to raise $6000. These funds will be divided between recording, mixing, mastering, photography, graphic design, CD pressing, digital distribution, and copyright. Believe it or not, there's a TON of steps involved in getting music out!</li>
<li>PERKS PERKS PERKS. I love giving. By helping fund this EP, you'll have exclusive access to the process of the EP, you'll be the first to hear the songs, I'll send you digital and physical copies of the EP, and more, based on the contribution level. This wouldn't be possible without YOU.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal, the EP release will be pushed back by a few or several months, depending on how far we get. I'm a recent college graduate working two day jobs along with gigging weekly, so my funds are very tight. I want this EP to happen and soon, but unfortunately, money plays an enormous role in the timing. The funds will go to studio time first, and once that's done, we'll move on to other essentials like EP artwork and distribution.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Help Me Help Others</h3>
<p>My music has never been about me. I write and perform to make a difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Songwriting allows me to connect with people living through a hard time and needing a shoulder to lean on. Music is very therapeutic and these five songs have the potential to connect with many, many people. All I want is for my personal experiences to resonate with someone and make them feel.</li>
<li>Funding this album would allow me to get these songs out and reach thousands, if not millions, of people around the world.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Hurdles &amp; Obstacles</h3>
<p>There are challenges that come with releasing new music.</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a few hurdles to jump before getting these songs out. The biggest hurdle is the financial one. Without sufficient funds, the EP simply can't happen. After that, it's time and commitment. Without organization and planning, the process will be much messier.</li>
<li>In order to overcome these obstacles, I'll be setting a timeline for myself on when to get everything done. By sticking to this timeline, the EP will be done in an organized and timely manner. In order to raise the funds, I'll be combining promotion efforts via social media, word of mouth, email blasts, and a YouTube video or two to get the word out. The more people who see this, the more people will contribute and help make this EP a reality!</li>
</ul>

How La Guerrera EP//The Warrior EP came to be..
In case you don't know who I am, hi, I'm Gaby! 23-year-old singer-songwriter born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and a temporary Twin Cities transplant while I completed my Bachelor of Music in Composition and Songwriting at McNally Smith College of Music in St. Paul, Minnesota. I've been writing songs since I was 12 and performing regularly since age 14. I primarily play guitar and sing, but I also play mandolin, ukulele, and piano/keyboards. Between 2011 and 2015, I released three studio albums, and the most recent came to life with the help of Indiegogo, so I've decided to use this wonderful platform again to help fund this EP! It's been a while since I got music out to you and you deserve some new tunes!
So...how did these songs come to be?
While in college, for my senior portfolio, one of my requirements was to write a stylistic track (in other words, a song outside of my typical genre). I chose to pay homage to my Hispanic heritage and wrote a song called ""Guerrera."" This song, as the title suggests, is about being a warrior and knowing your worth. I was raised in a family of feminists and powerful women on both sides of my family, so it has always been instilled in me that I can do whatever I want and achieve whatever I want by my own means. Equality and justice are two words I heard a lot growing up. This is the first song where I've written lyrics in Spanish, and that was very empowering in itself.
The next song, ""Stronger,"" is actually one of my oldest songs that was on my first album but I'm re-recording it since it's changed a bit over the last almost 10 years. I wrote this song about one of my best friends who saved my life back in middle school. Sometimes in order to be strong, you have to let someone be strong for you. Friendships are absolutely essential in life and I wrote this song to reflect that.
""Thrill,"" lyrically, is probably the most risqué song I've ever written. This song touches on sexual empowerment, a topic I never saw myself writing about. But...it makes sense that my lyrical content would go through a change between the ages of 12 and 23! So many mainstream songs these days objectify women and I'm tired of that, so this song came from my own desires and passions, from the perspective of an empowered young woman who isn't afraid to chase after what she wants.
I started writing ""Goddess"" and ""The Fight"" the same night in June of 2017. It had been months since I'd written anything, and I had lots of ideas I needed to get out. ""Goddess"" came from a more vulnerable spot. The chorus is essentially a chant to repeat over and over when you're feeling powerless and defenseless. No matter what, you are a goddess. You can take care of yourself, persevere, and prosper. ""The Fight"" came from an angrier spot. A few people from my past caused a lot of psychological damage through bullying, manipulation, and other harmful acts. Lots of people tell me I'm stubborn and tenacious; I'm never down for long. That's exactly what ""The Fight"" is about.
Successfully reaching the goal for this campaign will allow me to get these five extremely personal songs out to you in mid-2018!! I want to leave about a year and a half between this EP and my fourth studio album, which is still being written.

What's the Bang for My Buck?
Let me break it down:

In order to get this EP out into the world and your hands/smartphones/laptops, I need to raise $6000. These funds will be divided between recording, mixing, mastering, photography, graphic design, CD pressing, digital distribution, and copyright. Believe it or not, there's a TON of steps involved in getting music out!
PERKS PERKS PERKS. I love giving. By helping fund this EP, you'll have exclusive access to the process of the EP, you'll be the first to hear the songs, I'll send you digital and physical copies of the EP, and more, based on the contribution level. This wouldn't be possible without YOU.
If I don't reach my goal, the EP release will be pushed back by a few or several months, depending on how far we get. I'm a recent college graduate working two day jobs along with gigging weekly, so my funds are very tight. I want this EP to happen and soon, but unfortunately, money plays an enormous role in the timing. The funds will go to studio time first, and once that's done, we'll move on to other essentials like EP artwork and distribution.


Help Me Help Others
My music has never been about me. I write and perform to make a difference:

Songwriting allows me to connect with people living through a hard time and needing a shoulder to lean on. Music is very therapeutic and these five songs have the potential to connect with many, many people. All I want is for my personal experiences to resonate with someone and make them feel.
Funding this album would allow me to get these songs out and reach thousands, if not millions, of people around the world.


Hurdles & Obstacles
There are challenges that come with releasing new music.

There's a few hurdles to jump before getting these songs out. The biggest hurdle is the financial one. Without sufficient funds, the EP simply can't happen. After that, it's time and commitment. Without organization and planning, the process will be much messier.
In order to overcome these obstacles, I'll be setting a timeline for myself on when to get everything done. By sticking to this timeline, the EP will be done in an organized and timely manner. In order to raise the funds, I'll be combining promotion efforts via social media, word of mouth, email blasts, and a YouTube video or two to get the word out. The more people who see this, the more people will contribute and help make this EP a reality!
