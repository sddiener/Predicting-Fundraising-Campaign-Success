<p>This campaign is a fundraiser for three of Sparkplug Books’ upcoming publishing projects.  Our soonest release, scheduled for April of 2012, is the graphic novel <em>Nurse Nurse</em>, by Katie Skelly.  This book compiles the previously self-published first seven issues of Katie’s ongoing sci-fi saga of nurses traversing the planets of our solar system.  The new book includes an eighth chapter to conclude the story.  The book has a two-color cover and black and white interior.</p>
<p>Our next two projects come from artists with whom Sparkplug has worked on multiple books in our past.  <em>Reich, </em>a series by Elijah Brubaker, is the ongoing biography of eminent sexologist Wilhelm Reich; this will be issue 9.  Olga Volozova, who has released <em>Rock That Never Sleeps</em> (a collaboration with Juliacks) and <em>The Airy Tales</em> through Sparkplug, brings us <em>The Golem of Gabirol</em>.  Each of these will have full color covers and black and white interior pages.</p>
<p>These books are of special import not only because they are amazing in themselves, but because they are the last projects on which Sparkplug founder Dylan Williams was working before he died of cancer in September 2011.  We are honored to see these through to completion and work with such great talent.</p>
<p>Sparkplug has had a long working relationship with Portland company Brown Printing and we intend to use them again to get these books printed out.  Currently the layouts are complete for each project and finishing touches are being made before they are sent to Brown.  The money from this fundraiser will go towards printing costs of each book, as well as shipping costs for the books and other gifts we are offering as perks. </p>
<p><strong>Please join us in making these books a reality!  Donate to the Sparkplug fundraiser today!</strong></p>

<h3>
<em>Before you pledge</em>....</h3>
<p>While our goal is to raise funds, we are offering a rarely seen phenomenon in campaigns, because the perks and rewards we offer are equal in value to the donation you make!  In other words, what you donate, you get returned in equal value in rewards!</p>
<p><strong>STEPS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>See the perks</li>
<li>Pick an amount</li>
<li>Donate Now</li>
<li>Get Rewards</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2>DETAILS</h2>
<h3>The Purpose of This Campaign</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We would like to fund a gallery event exhibit, but we need pieces to create.  Therefore we have thought of a clever way of raising funds for new material while giving back to the backers!</p>
<p>Get involved now and take part in a movement to create new and fresh art and expand it to the masses.  New talent and rising stars usually encounter difficulties along the way, and sometimes, their well-being depends on a successful campaign.</p>
<p>Help promote new art by 'chipping in' to be able to raise funds for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be able to afford high quality printing and create magnificent prints that can be matted and framed to be sold at affordable prices (for those that cannot purchase the original piece but still appreciate the art).</li>
<li>For the creation of full-size <span class=""st""><em>Giclée</em> reproductions of some selected works.</span>
</li>
<li><span class=""st"">To raise funds for the continued creation of new works from the artist.</span></li>
<li>For the promotion of the art throughout the States and other countries.<span class=""st""><br/></span>
</li>
<li>To create new material for upcoming art shows and events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Art has increasingly become less attainable due to the economic hardships many are facing, causing a monopoly of high-quality work obtainability.</p>
<p>YOUR participation will help us reach beyond our own limits and restrictions.  The magnitude of your support will make it possible for American Artists who are undiscovered, to reach beyond their own limits.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Contribution levels have different rewards.  With these funds we will also be able to create the rewards that you will receive for your donation.  By giving you will receive.</p>
<p>Each of the contribution categories has a unique gift(s) as a token of our gratitude.</p>
<p>Please use the following Main List for pieces to choose from, for those Perks that our backers will have a choice of preference to make.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Portrait 18"" X 24""</li>
<li>The Last Cube 31″ X 31″</li>
<li>Infrastructure: Visual Explanation 4' X 2'</li>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We will not only be broadening our reach by giving back great gifts to all our backers nationwide, but once we finish, it's time to get to work.  With the remaining contribution funds we will be attending art events to gain recognition.  We are simply looking for L-O-V-E !! (Love Of Visual Experience)</p>
<p>Remaining funds (after backers are fullfilled) will be used to create more promotional material to help spread the art.  Any remaining materials that can be used for profit will go right back into the arts.  (I.E. buying more materials, paints, inks, paper, ETC).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have gained much awareness for other events we have raised funds for, like recycling programs, and now have a great opportunity to keep it going with your help.</p>
<p>If we hit 35% ABOVE our goal, we will use half those proceeds to buy drawing and school supplies to send to kids in less fortunate countries.  If a trip has not been arranged to one of these countries within 3 months after the funds are available, then we will donate it to at-risk-youth and inner city school Arts programs.</p>

<h3>Who I am<br/>
</h3>
<p>My name is Indigo.  I'm a visual artist, dancer, writer and curator based in Vancouver BC.  I currently work in many mediums including stencils, posters, 
acrylics, oils, photography, printmaking and more; creating art for inside and outside.  My artwork is an 
exploration of human emotion, personal story and the weight of memory.  
Influenced by my own history, that of the people around me and the 
imagined histories of strangers, my work often carries a poetic sense 
of melancholy, the kind of thoughtful sadness that persists long after 
the tears are gone.  From my lifetime of dance training comes a 
deep-rooted knowledge and understanding of the human figure, of movement
 and stillness and the brief eternity that lies between. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I was raised in a log home in Northern BC in a space of solitude
 and bright stars, of deep forests and shallow lakes.  Born into a 
family of artists and activists, my creative practice has always been 
interdisciplinary.  Upon moving to the Lower Mainland in 2000, I 
studied contemporary dance at Simon Fraser University.  I spent the years after 
graduation working as a choreographer, performer and 
instructor in Canada and the United States, both independently and as a 
part of multiple companies and collectives.  Following a more recent 
transition into the visual arts, my work has been shown at 
galleries, art festivals and on the streets in Canada, the United 
States, the UK and across Europe.</p>

<p>One of my upcoming projects is a 6 week residency with <a href=""http://www.a-word-of-art.co.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">A WORD OF ART</a>, based in Cape Town, South Africa; scheduled for April 1st-May 15th, 2011.  During that time I will be creating a body of work for a gallery exhibit, painting murals around the city, and participating in community workshops with <a href=""http://www.writeonafrica.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Write on Africa</a>. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A WORD OF ART is an organization dedicated to celebrating
new art and emerging local and international artists.  It aims to create art projects and experiences rather then
white-wall gallery shows, building the creative community through art projects
that make use of its studio, project space and art gallery.   <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Write on Africa is an initiative of A WORD OF ART that
mobilizes creativity for inspiration, social change and urban
rejuvenation.  Their aim is to
rejuvenate the urban environment with color and inspire the youth, each other
and themselves. Write on Africa is a platform for artists to create the change
they wish to see, forming lasting connections with communities in order to
effect meaningful changes therein. </p>
<p>The video I've included above is from their most recent project - rejuvenating Percy Bartley House, a home for boys that operates out of 
an old house in the area. While at PBH, the boys are enrolled in school 
or skills training programs and are taught life skills before being 
reunited with their families. Over the years the home has become run 
down and has lost its sense of life and colour. This collaborative project restored life and colour into the
 home with wall murals done by well-known local artists.</p>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>I have big dreams, and a strong belief in the power of community to 
achieve great things, individually and collectively.  Cultivating a widespread network of like-minded creatives is the first step towards effecting meaningful change on a global level.  I am excited to be working with Write on Africa's community participants during my time in Cape Town, sharing my knowledge and skills to help children and youth find inspiration through the arts.  I am also looking forward to sharing space and ideas with other South African and international artists in residence.  I hope that the impact of this project stretches far past its completion date, forming relationships that will lead to further collaborations in many places around the world, including in my own city of Vancouver.<br/>
</div><div><h3>What I need and what you get<br/>
</h3></div><div>
<p>My main costs for this project are flights, accommodation, materials and food.  I am applying for provincial and national travel grants, but I cannot rely on them as my sole source of funding.  Flights to Cape Town are about $1500, accommodation is $1200, and I figure I can get by with about $500 each for materials and food.  All in all it comes to just over $4000, and I'm hoping to raise half of that via this campaign. <br/></p>
<p><br/>As many of you know, I have an ongoing project called Mystery Mail in which you send me your address and I send you something random.  During my time in Cape Town I will be doing an extra special edition of Mystery Mail, with personalized handmade postcards and limited edition artwork available for donations of $25 and up.  (See 'perks' sidebar for details) </p>

</div></div>","Who I am

My name is Indigo.  I'm a visual artist, dancer, writer and curator based in Vancouver BC.  I currently work in many mediums including stencils, posters, 
acrylics, oils, photography, printmaking and more; creating art for inside and outside.  My artwork is an 
exploration of human emotion, personal story and the weight of memory.  
Influenced by my own history, that of the people around me and the 
imagined histories of strangers, my work often carries a poetic sense 
of melancholy, the kind of thoughtful sadness that persists long after 
the tears are gone.  From my lifetime of dance training comes a 
deep-rooted knowledge and understanding of the human figure, of movement
 and stillness and the brief eternity that lies between. 

I was raised in a log home in Northern BC in a space of solitude
 and bright stars, of deep forests and shallow lakes.  Born into a 
family of artists and activists, my creative practice has always been 
interdisciplinary.  Upon moving to the Lower Mainland in 2000, I 
studied contemporary dance at Simon Fraser University.  I spent the years after 
graduation working as a choreographer, performer and 
instructor in Canada and the United States, both independently and as a 
part of multiple companies and collectives.  Following a more recent 
transition into the visual arts, my work has been shown at 
galleries, art festivals and on the streets in Canada, the United 
States, the UK and across Europe.

Most of you probably know me! But for those who do not, my name is Sean Wozniak or Swoz. I am a growing photographer who is looking for assistance. I am not looking for handouts, I am looking to earn your help. I shoot mostly portraiture and cosplay, but I shoot anything that I find interesting.


This campaign is basically two things: Help me immediately replace my aging, extremely well used (and now defective) D80, and simultaneously continue my learning and progression in Photography.


Essentially right now, you all hold the power to make or break photography in the foreseeable future for me. Without your contributions, I cannot effectively do photoshoots and pursue the projects and learning activities I have in mind.

Details:


100% of the funding from this will go into purchasing a camera, lenses and peripherals needed in buying a new camera.


Hopefully the perks are worthwhile to you!


The perks are simple, but at the same time I hope that they are significant enough to justify your extremely generous donations.

Regardless of the amount given, I will be putting it towards a new camera and lens. The product of that will be more photographs!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I came up with this idea while I was still in school studying to be a mechanical engineer. I wanted a way to take notes digitally with my cellphone. After 9 prototypes, I finally came up with the Infinity Binder. It works by writing with a dry erase marker, then photographing the notes with a cellphone or tablet, and finally erasing the notes so the pages can be reused an infinite number of times.</p>
<p>The concept works extremely well. All of my notes from my last two semesters are stored on my google drive account, and backed up on a flashdrive. Recently I even discovered that had I uploaded them all to my Evernote account, I would have been able to do word searches within my notes via evernote's character recognition feature.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it simply works. It's a robust and efficient way for anyone to completely stop using paper. Furthermore, it overcomes the hurdles that current tablets face, which are battery life and an ease of use that resembles pencil and paper. There is zero learning curve with the Infinity Binder. If you already know how to write with a pencil and paper, and you know how to take a picture with a cellphone, then you know more than enough to enter the world of digital note taking.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I currently have a provisional patent on this design, however this will expire soon. The funding that I receive from you guys will go straight toward paying for the full patent on this idea, and it will assist in paying for the cost of materials and labor that it takes to make these binders. Ultimately, I want to sell the idea to a larger company that can manufacture the Infinity Binders on a more grand scale. But until that day comes, I will be trying to invest in technology that will help me manufacture these at a faster and cheaper rate. If tests prove successful, some of the funding will most likely go towards purchasing a steel rule die cut aparatus for cutting the inner pages, which could potentially cut the manufacturing time in half for each binder.</p>
<p>Perks:</p>
<p>$5 - Membership - You will be become an official member of the Infinity Binder Team, and we will send you emails keeping you updated on any progress that we make.</p>
<p>$35 - 1 Infinity Binder - You will be taking a giant leap towards a paperless future. Before shipment, you will be asked what color you will want your binder to be.</p>
<p>$60 - 2 Infinity Binders - Go paperless and share the love with a friend. Before shipment, you will be asked what colors you will want your binders to be.</p>
<p>$1000 - The BIG ONE - You will receive 10 Infinity Binders and I will make a video in which I will do 10 handstands, and blow 1000 kisses to you. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The future is closer than we think when it comes to paperless note taking. Your contribution will speed up this bright future and allow this generation to enjoy the benefits of going digital. Furthermore, it will enable people to be less wasteful and reduce their environmental impact, which means we will be providing a better world for the next generation.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For those of you who cannot contribute, you can still help out by sharing this with your friends and family.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you will enjoy going paperless as much as I have.</p>
<p>(Note: please don't let the $10,000 goal scare you. It is a little high for what I actually need, which is closer to $3,000 for the patent application. I chose it as an arbitrary number and I am unable to edit it now.)</p>

We are a non-profit corporation registered with New York State Charities (50517) and a 501(c)3 registered with the federal government (EIN 13-3054182). Contributions are tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Our board of directors and staff are all volunteers; we have no paid staff or board. We often hire artists and other professionals at fair market value fees for certain services and provide the artists we publish with complementary copies of our publications. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In addition  to publishing, we offer free advice and  workshops for writers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Over the 37 years of our existence, any profits we have made from book sales and events goes towards continuing our mission of publishing and supporting writers and artists. In the past we have been supported by Bronx Council on the Arts, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Chemical  Bank, the Edler G. Hawkins Foundation and private contributions. Due to the current economic slow down, we have lost what little funding we may have had and need funds BADLY to continue to pursue our mssion.</span></p>

</div>
</div><div> <p>We are seeking a minimum of $5000 to enable us to publish more writers and provide resources for writers and artists. Funds we receive will go only toward these activities and, again, no individual associated  with the company will gain financially from the funds raised.</p>
<p>For those who contribute at least $25.00, we will send them a copy of our 112-page 35th anniversary journal which contains poetry by 30 well-established writers along with photos and archival material covering the first 35 years of our existence. A contribution of $100 or more will receive the anthology along with four additional publications from our inventory.</p>
<p>Whether or not we reach our goal of $5000, whatever we receive will go toward publishing and programming.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Of the many alternative presses which began in the 1970s, we are one of only a very few which have survived. We serve  a wide range of constituents, especially those which are underserved, e.g. African American, Latino, Asian, Native American, immigrants, the disabled, seniors and the incarcerated. To date we have published over 300 writers and artists of all ethnicities. Your contribution will enable us to continue to serve these communities. We are committed to literature and art and we want to continue  providing an outlet for artists of all kinds, Over the years we have proven that our services make a difference in our communities.</p>

</div></div>","Blind Beggar Press, Inc. Since 1977 we have published emerging and established writers and artists fro m throughout the U.S. as well as the Caribbean, Europe and Africa. We are a non-profit corporation registered with New York State Charities (50517) and a 501(c)3 registered with the federal government (EIN 13-3054182). Contributions are tax-deductible.
Our board of directors and staff are all volunteers; we have no paid staff or board. We often hire artists and other professionals at fair market value fees for certain services and provide the artists we publish with complementary copies of our publications. In addition  to publishing, we offer free advice and  workshops for writers.
Over the 37 years of our existence, any profits we have made from book sales and events goes towards continuing our mission of publishing and supporting writers and artists. In the past we have been supported by Bronx Council on the Arts, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Chemical  Bank, the Edler G. Hawkins Foundation and private contributions. Due to the current economic slow down, we have lost what little funding we may have had and need funds BADLY to continue to pursue our mssion.
 
What We Need & What You Get

 We are seeking a minimum of $5000 to enable us to publish more writers and provide resources for writers and artists. Funds we receive will go only toward these activities and, again, no individual associated  with the company will gain financially from the funds raised.
For those who contribute at least $25.00, we will send them a copy of our 112-page 35th anniversary journal which contains poetry by 30 well-established writers along with photos and archival material covering the first 35 years of our existence. A contribution of $100 or more will receive the anthology along with four additional publications from our inventory.
Whether or not we reach our goal of $5000, whatever we receive will go toward publishing and programming.
  The Impact Of the many alternative presses which began in the 1970s, we are one of only a very few which have survived. We serve  a wide range of constituents, especially those which are underserved, e.g. African American, Latino, Asian, Native American, immigrants, the disabled, seniors and the incarcerated. To date we have published over 300 writers and artists of all ethnicities. Your contribution will enable us to continue to serve these communities. We are committed to literature and art and we want to continue  providing an outlet for artists of all kinds, Over the years we have proven that our services make a difference in our communities.

<h3>Our Stretch Goal: <br/>
</h3>
<p>At the basic level, we are shooting for raising $3500 for equipment we can use right now the most. This will get us the equipment, tools, and materials to raise our bar to the next level. Our stretch goal however is set at $10,000, which will help us buy more torches, another even larger kiln, and the tools and materials that will launch us into glass-working epicness. Photography equipment such as a professional camera and lighting kit will help us big time to make sure every piece of art and lighting gets represented in the most professional way possible. Also, the extra funds will allow us to create more spec glass lighting units (Chandeliers, sconces, hanging pendant lights) that we can use for showing to galleries, interior designer/decorators, and private clients as examples of our work. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>Aloha! We are Elfriede and
Tim Friesen. We live on the Big Island of Hawaii and we make beautiful Glass
Art. Inspired by the work we made for galleries and custom clients, we are
asked to make high end art such as glass lighting. Our studio is basic and requires
a tune up: a new torch, bigger kiln and an oxygen generator. We are used to do it all by ourselves, but in
this case we need to ask for your help. In return we will make all that you
want. If you give, we’ll give!<br/>
With the holiday season coming soon, we are sure you and your loved ones will
be excited to see those packages with glass art from Hawaii coming in.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What
You Get</h3>

of what we figure we will need to help for this upgrade. So rest assured that every dollar you spend will go DIRECTLY to helping make
this happen. If<span>  we should exceed our
goal, all the better: our stretch goal will allow us to REALLY get going, with
more fancy tools and an assortment of glass we can build our DREAM STUDIO.</span></p>
<p>In return for your help we'll
have everything from a Personal Postcard from us here in Hawaii written and sent to YOU! Single fused pendants by Elfriede and single flame-worked pendants by Tim. We also are offering these Hawaiian Style fused glass and flame-worked pendants in sets so you can have plenty for your personal wearing, or gift giving to others!<span>   And for those who want the finest in hand blown Hawaiian Holiday Tree Ornaments, they are ready to adorn your tree. <br/></span></p>

The voice consistent with one person recounting conversations and actions with the other. Similar to a diary talking about a best friend. As I move around the room different text will appear and the distance from me to the projector will determine how much the viewer can read at a time. Movement will play a primary role in the work although I do not anticipate this as dance driven in a conventional way. I will instead craft phrase work by use of text and tactile references from memory. I will also use Jung’s ideas of forward and  backward movement in relation to consciousness to create choreography.

ONLY 300 DOMINOES AVAILABLE! Once all these dominoes are given as perks, only monetary donations will be accepted.</b></p>
<p><b>The Ebola
Domino Project</b> is
a creative humanitarian experiment originating at Pacific University near
Portland, Oregon that converts the talents of visual artists into donor
dollars. Briefly, artists create dominoes, we collect and display them in an
interactive exhibit, and then give them as perks for donations that will go to
AmeriCares, an aid organization working in Ebola-stricken west
Africa. At the core of the project is the hope of providing some measure
of relief for the families and communities of west Africa still suffering from
Ebola's long-lasting physical and socioeconomic impact. Here's how the project works:</p>
<p><b>Dominoes: </b>Domino forms were chosen
because, as they are lined up together, they illustrate the potential chain
reaction that can occur as disease is spread or health care is provided. Each
5-inch wood domino has two sides, representing both the negative spread of the
disease and the hopeful eradication or cure. Over 150 professional and amateur artists from across the country have participated, including artists from California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Montana, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. All have graciously invested their time and energy to learn about Ebola-stricken west Africa, creating these unique dominoes with intention and empathy using a variety of media and styles. As of May 5th, we have 300 dominoes available, and we will choose them for you as perks for your donations. Once all of the dominoes have been claimed, only monetary donations for this project will be accepted!</p>
<p><b>Exhibition:</b> The collection of dominoes
received will be featured in an interactive exhibit on May 13th at Pacific
University in Forest Grove, Oregon, where visitors can play with the dominoes,
lining them up and cascading them down to represent the tipping point of either
disease or health. At the conclusion of the exhibition on May 20th, the dominoes will be
mailed to donors.</p>
<p><b>Donation: </b>Make a donation to aid and rebuild Ebola-stricken west Africa and receive art in return! Donate with a perk, and we choose dominoes to send to you. Or donate without a perk, and then money will go straight to AmeriCares. All domino perks will be mailed out after the exhibition, with the donations sent directly to AmeriCares, with the money specifically
earmarked for Ebola aid. And thanks to AmeriCares' matching corporate donors, every $1 donated to them results in $20
of aid to west Africa. For every $25 ""purchase"" of a domino, we
expect to donate around $20, after Indiegogo fees and the cost of
mailing the domino to you. So, buy one domino and the resulting $20 donation equals
$400 in aid. Our goal is to sell all 300 available dominoes as perks, totaling $6,000 sent to AmeriCares, which
would equal an effective matching donation of $120,000!</p>
<p><b>Impact: </b>Although the epidemic seems to be
almost under control, the long-lasting socioeconomic impact of Ebola will be devastating to
the affected countries. Beyond the over-burdened regional healthcare systems
are thousands of new orphans, broken families, neglected fields, and food
shortages. While this project can generate only a fraction of what is needed to
help aid in this crisis, it can allow us to reflect on our interdependence as
global citizens and responsibility to one another we share as human beings.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>The inspiration for this project was deeply personal. We as organizers both identify as survivors of sexual violence and women of color and this intersectional identity lays a large part of the foundation and importance of this project to us.  Our intention in creating The Art of Life After project is to create space for survivors and supportive communities to celebrate art and creativity that may have arisen from the complexity of a life including experiences of violence.</span></p>
<p>The Art of Life After started with one art show and through personal work and community support is developing into a larger multidimensional project. The next installment is The Art of Life After: Workshop Series, a weekend event that will focus on building strategies and capacities for self-care and community-care through creative and expressive healing workshops for survivors of intimate violence. The Workshop Series will culminate in a final show of voice and intentional witnessing, open to the public.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3>
<div>We are asking for $750 to support us in paying for an adviser with expertise in community organizing and clinical practice in social work and trauma. We will also use this money to provide small stipends for ourselves as organizers and pay for any extra expenses that the show may incur outside of our currently planned budget. </div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are interested in opening up what it means to be survivors of intimate and sexual violence and co-creating community around these questions. We are interested in allowing survivorship to be a part of our lives in a way that we author for ourselves. The Art of Life After works to hold both the pain of experiencing intimate violences and the strength we have in ourselves and in the communities we can create. </span><br/></p>Twinned with the work of healing for survivors, is The Art of Life After's intention towards general community education around topics of sexual and intimate violence, decreasing stigmas associated with survivor identities, and building integration between our personal, inter-personal, and community lives.</div><div>

Although we met our initial benchmark, we are continuing to fundraise in order to increase the funding to compensate our amazing community partners and artists in a way that truly acknowledges the power of the work that they do. If you feel moved to still donate, all donations will absolutely be put to positive use and if you cannot donate, please support us by sharing our campaign.


Again, we truly appreciate and value your support from the bottom of our hearts.  <3 Mattie & Alicia ~


Short Summary 
The inspiration for this project was deeply personal. We as organizers both identify as survivors of sexual violence and women of color and this intersectional identity lays a large part of the foundation and importance of this project to us.  Our intention in creating The Art of Life After project is to create space for survivors and supportive communities to celebrate art and creativity that may have arisen from the complexity of a life including experiences of violence.
The Art of Life After started with one art show and through personal work and community support is developing into a larger multidimensional project. The next installment is The Art of Life After: Workshop Series, a weekend event that will focus on building strategies and capacities for self-care and community-care through creative and expressive healing workshops for survivors of intimate violence. The Workshop Series will culminate in a final show of voice and intentional witnessing, open to the public.
   What We Need 
We are asking for $750 to support us in paying for an adviser with expertise in community organizing and clinical practice in social work and trauma. We will also use this money to provide small stipends for ourselves as organizers and pay for any extra expenses that the show may incur outside of our currently planned budget.    The Impact We are interested in opening up what it means to be survivors of intimate and sexual violence and co-creating community around these questions. We are interested in allowing survivorship to be a part of our lives in a way that we author for ourselves. The Art of Life After works to hold both the pain of experiencing intimate violences and the strength we have in ourselves and in the communities we can create. Twinned with the work of healing for survivors, is The Art of Life After's intention towards general community education around topics of sexual and intimate violence, decreasing stigmas associated with survivor identities, and building integration between our personal, inter-personal, and community lives.
    Other Ways You Can Help 
If you are interested in the project but cannot support financially please support us by sharing this fundraising page and/or our website www.artoflifeafter.org. Also please stay tuned for our events coming this April 2016, which will all be free for the community to attend. We would be honored to have you be a part.

<p>All funds raised for this hand-drawn coloring book will go towards a volunteer trip I'll be taking with Team4Tech. In March, I'll be spending two weeks working with a nonprofit in Siem Reap, Cambodia called Journeys Within Our Communities (JWOC) to implement technology and strengthen courses on English, digital literacy, and STEM programs for underserved youth and adults.  </p>
<p>I was interested in this project because I believe that technology has the power to create opportunity. It particularly resonated because both my parents were immigrants, and created successful lives in the US through careers in technology. I thought this project was a wonderful opportunity to use my background and expertise in technology to hopefully empower others as well.</p>

<h3>Great Cause! But Why a Coloring Book?</h3>I've been drawing and doodling as long as I can remember, and I've always been fascinated by mythology. As a young girl, I'd wile away hours in the library reading up on the shenanigans Greek goddesses and gods got into as if I were reading the tabloids. Once accepted into this project, I wanted something to be able to offer potential donors, and something that grew me as an artist.

</div></div>","Global Goddesses Coloring Book Fundraiser: The Cause
All funds raised for this hand-drawn coloring book will go towards a volunteer trip I'll be taking with Team4Tech. In March, I'll be spending two weeks working with a nonprofit in Siem Reap, Cambodia called Journeys Within Our Communities (JWOC) to implement technology and strengthen courses on English, digital literacy, and STEM programs for underserved youth and adults.  
I was interested in this project because I believe that technology has the power to create opportunity. It particularly resonated because both my parents were immigrants, and created successful lives in the US through careers in technology. I thought this project was a wonderful opportunity to use my background and expertise in technology to hopefully empower others as well.
Learn more about Team4Tech and their volunteer trips here.
Learn more about JWOC here.

Great Cause! But Why a Coloring Book?I've been drawing and doodling as long as I can remember, and I've always been fascinated by mythology. As a young girl, I'd wile away hours in the library reading up on the shenanigans Greek goddesses and gods got into as if I were reading the tabloids. Once accepted into this project, I wanted something to be able to offer potential donors, and something that grew me as an artist. While brainstorming, I looked at the beautiful intricacy of Cambodian goddesses depicted in Angkor Wat online, started doodling... and the rest is history.  And why goddesses? First, I'm a feminist and I love telling stories of strong women. Second, I am fascinated by how almost all cultures have powerful women in their mythology, and as I've done more and more research, I've been so inspired by their stories and their strength. Here's a timelapse timelapse of me inking in Innana, the Sumerian goddess of love, fertility, and warfare. 


And some photos documenting the process of Amaterasu, the Shinto goddess of the sun.


   Where the Money Goes
 The $4000 I hope to raise will go toward the following:  $2500 covers the cost of the project, including purchasing tablets and other peripherals (requested by JWOC) to be donated to organization, and also covers trip logistics $900-1200 covers my flight (estimate)
 $600-800 covers my printing costs (estimate)

Remaining funds will be used to cover Indiegogo's platform fee and any unexpected expenses associated with the project. After all expenses are covered, any remaining money will be donated to Team4Tech.

Note: Donations are NOT tax deductible. This is because I set up my fundraiser to cover my travel and book production expenses in addition to the donation to the nonprofit. If it’s important to you to get a tax write-off form, please consider donating to one of my teammates instead.

<h3>24:1</h3>
<p>Two years ago, we entered the BFA program as 24 well-rested graphic design novices. After many, many late nights, caffeinated beverages, and morale-boosting karaoke sessions, our time at CSULB has come to a close. If you know us, you're familiar with just how much the program has consumed our lives over the last four semesters. You've heard and tolerated us rambling about projects, deadlines, and critiques incessantly. In one month, we'd like to share all of that hard work with you in person. This show is something we've been working towards since our first month as strangers. For two days, we are transforming Nobo gallery into our own curated graphic design experience - highlighting all of our individual and collaborative efforts as family: a celebration of our work, a goodbye to our studies, and a thank you to our supporters.</p>
<h3>OUR GOAL</h3>
<p>For this show to be as spectacular as we hope, there are inevitable expenses that come with the territory. We are entirely self-funded, and in preparation we've acquired income from two main sources: a fee we all contribute quarterly, and numerous fundraising events. But that doesn't mean we couldn't use a little extra boost from all of our friends, family, and supporters! All the money we've raised and the money we hope to raise from this campaign will go directly towards venue costs (which include rental and workers) as well as all the fees for set-up and printing. And as a little extra thank you, we will include an exclusive RESOLUTION-branded show item with your donation.</p>
<p>We'd greatly appreciate any contributions you can offer, but even if it's not possible, sharing our website and this donation page would help heaps!</p>
<p>THANK YOU from all 24 of us for the support. </p>

<p>My name is Jay, and I am a potter and writer.  I create one of a kind raku pottery.  Pottery is one of the most ancient art forms and crafts in the world.  With this ancient art form I pair retelling of myths and legends, mostly old and some new.  I would like to share my work with people and bring this to you and others to have in your home in the form of an 8.5 x 8.5 book.  <a href=""http://rakupottery.ca/raku-vases/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can see samples of my work and read some of the stories I create here.</a></p>
<p>Raku pottery is my great love in life.  I am passionate about sharing this unique process and my exploration of it with others in an accessible way for all.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign you will allow me to print my first book and share my work with the world.</p>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>‘A Potter’s Dream: Myths &amp; Legends’ pairs my pottery creations with myths and legends from around the world retold with my own quirky spin. It makes for a great coffee table book, bedtime reading, bathroom book or gift for the art lover on your shopping list.</p>
<p>‘A Potter’s Dream: Myths &amp; Legends’ will be available to those who support our crowdfunding campaign. You can receive a digital copy of the book for $4! Printed copies are $25/each and include shipping within Canada and the United States. We also have a number of other perks that pair our pottery with this book, including one of a kind raku pieces, raku Christmas ornaments and the chance to work with us to create a vase and story to be included in the book as a special gift for someone you love.  All of our perks will be sent out in time for the holidays!</p>
<p><strong>*Please note - Most perks with pottery are only currently available in Canada and the United States.  If you live elsewhere and are interested in one of these perks, email me here and I will provide you with the total cost of the perk with shipping and add it to the campaign.</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://facebook.com/AlchemistsStudio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can read some customer reviews here</a>, from those I have shipped pottery to in the past so you can support this campaign with confidence.</p>
<p>I am using this crowdfunding campaign to defray costs for an initial print run.  I am seeking at least half of my printing costs to move forward with this project and print the book, and that is the amount that I have set my goal for.  If I do not hit that goal you will not be charged for the project.  If I raise more money then the goal, it will go to the remaining half of the printing costs.  Any additional funds will be used to support my creative work in the studio and for future book projects.</p>
<p>I hope that this project will bring more appreciation and understanding for this ancient craft to the world and help share legends of old with the people of today in a way that entertains and engages people. </p>
<p>This project is a natural next step from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgQwJ2wy3IA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my recent art show 'The Myth of Family'.</a></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As an artist living with an anxiety disorder, drawing and coloring is an important therapy for me. I want to share this incredible tool with as many people as possible. These otherworld landscapes have been a joy for me to dream of and draw. I hope that they will heal you, spark your imagination, and inspire you to create your own stories of quiet magic. You can find more of my work at: <a href=""https://coraleecreates.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://coraleecreates.com/</a></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I don't need to raise any specific amount for this project, as my production costs will be minimal. Half of the work is already complete—I have 6 coloring pages done so far.</p>
<p>For a one-time fee of $12, you'll get 12 coloring pages in the form of high-res PDFs that you can print and color as many times as you like. You'll receive 3 pages in the first month (May 2018) and one new page each month thereafter until February 2019, for a total of 12.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>All proceeds of this campaign will go to pay for funeral expenses for my sister Marsha, who passed away suddenly on April 13th. She suffered from epilepsy and we believe she had a fatal seizure during the night.  Marsha was 24 years old and pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. She is one of the most genuinely kind, open-minded and open-hearted people I have known. My family is devastated by this loss and now facing a heavy financial burden to pay for a funeral service. I hope to make this transition a little easier for all who are grieving. Thank you so much for your support.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about Marsha or give more, you can also visit Marsha's gofundme page: <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/marsha-lee-funeral"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gofundme.com/marsha-lee-funeral</a></p>

<p>Hello! My name is Neil. I am the creator of the cards you've been looking at.</p>
<p>My girlfriend was the one who inspired me with her own Tarot cards to make this deck, however I added my own influence of astrology to it, something that I've always had a fascination with.</p>
<p>As I was creating the 12 court cards I discovered that each of the other cards have an astrological meaning to them. Something that was put into place by the three founding fathers of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Dr William Wynn Wescott, Dr Robert Woodman and Samuel Mathers.</p>
<p>With this knowledge I went ahead and furthered my deck from a regular playing card deck into a deck that can be used for cartomancy.</p>
<p>Throughout the journey of creating these cards I've learnt so much. This knowledge is something I would like to share with everyone else who's interested by means of a book that goes along with the deck.</p>

The Progress So Far
Hello! My name is Neil. I am the creator of the cards you've been looking at.
My girlfriend was the one who inspired me with her own Tarot cards to make this deck, however I added my own influence of astrology to it, something that I've always had a fascination with.
As I was creating the 12 court cards I discovered that each of the other cards have an astrological meaning to them. Something that was put into place by the three founding fathers of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Dr William Wynn Wescott, Dr Robert Woodman and Samuel Mathers.
With this knowledge I went ahead and furthered my deck from a regular playing card deck into a deck that can be used for cartomancy.
Throughout the journey of creating these cards I've learnt so much. This knowledge is something I would like to share with everyone else who's interested by means of a book that goes along with the deck.

 
My Goals:
1st Goal:

My main goal is getting the deck into production and getting it into the hands of people who like it.
If the first goal is reached the deck will be produced with 330 gsm superior smooth black core card stock.
With a UV coated gloss tuck box.


2nd Goal:

Protection of these cards is important as well as making them look as amazing as possible.
So if the second goal is reached the card box will be upgraded to a glossy laminated 2 part rigid box.

The top quarter of the box will be the lid that comes off, making it easy to get the cards out.
The rigid box will add protection and preserve your cards for longer.



3rd Goal:

The ultimate goal for these cards is superior quality, taking them to a higher level of quality.
If the third and final goal is met the cards will be upgraded to a silver finish around the edges as well as the 2 part rigid box.

<p>I
was recently awarded a one-month residency at <a href=""http://www.rensingcenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>The Rensing
Center</span></a> in Western South Carolina for the month of September
2015. While
there I will have the chance to focus almost exclusively on my work, something
all artists wish for, but few get to experience.</p>
<p>First, I’ll
continue working on mixed media <a href=""http://www.kristenmwatson.com/intuitivepaintings"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>intuitive paintings</span></a> and <a href=""http://www.kristenmwatson.com/printmaking/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>prints</span></a> using objects and
inspiration I find at the Center. Organic and synthetic objects are glued and
sewn to the painted canvas to explore the byproducts and ephemera of physical
existence and the human-nature connection. You can see and read more about
my projects on <a href=""http://www.kristenmwatson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>my website</span></a>, and by

<p><span>I'm also planning to begin working on a new project for an
exhibit scheduled for May 2016! This exhibit will focus on my experiences and

<p>I wasn't always an artist,
or at least I didn't call myself an artist until a few years ago, and I'm still
working on feeling the conviction of the word when I say it. But step by step,
day by day, it's beginning to sink in that I've been blessed with this amazing
life and the inspiration to translate a little bit of myself into art works that
I create and share with you.  </p>
<p>Following a three-year bout with a life-threatening illness, I was compelled to reexamine my career choice. Changes were in order. I wanted to do something
meaningful and healing every day. Even though I have always loved making art, I
feared change and the unknown. But I knew that if I recovered I had to leave a medically-oriented career to begin again as an artist.  </p>
<p>It wasn't an easy
transition, but with the steady support of friends and family, I'm now fully engaged in my new life and work. I’ve built
a home studio where I work almost every day. My art is shown regularly in local
and regional exhibits and held in private collections. I've been selected as an artist in residence at two local programs including the Vermont Studio Center, and I get to nurture other artists through my teaching practice.  I
am so humbled and thrilled to have this residency opportunity to focus on developing my practice. </p>

day by day, it's beginning to sink in that I've been blessed with this amazing
life and the inspiration to translate a little bit of myself into art works that
I create and share with you.  
Following a three-year bout with a life-threatening illness, I was compelled to reexamine my career choice. Changes were in order. I wanted to do something
meaningful and healing every day. Even though I have always loved making art, I
feared change and the unknown. But I knew that if I recovered I had to leave a medically-oriented career to begin again as an artist.  
It wasn't an easy
transition, but with the steady support of friends and family, I'm now fully engaged in my new life and work. I’ve built
a home studio where I work almost every day. My art is shown regularly in local
and regional exhibits and held in private collections. I've been selected as an artist in residence at two local programs including the Vermont Studio Center, and I get to nurture other artists through my teaching practice.  I
am so humbled and thrilled to have this residency opportunity to focus on developing my practice. 
It’s not easy to ask others
for money, even if you’re giving them something in return. Please know how much
I appreciate your contribution/purchase. It validates my efforts and my work. Thank you.    Magnolia, acrylic & oil pastel on canvas, 18 x 24""Violet Landscape, acrylic, watercolor, textiles, pearl strands on canvas, 30x40""",11.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>The Story</b></p>
<p>We are <a href=""https://vimeo.com/145500847"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elia Mrak</a> (USA) and <a href=""https://vimeo.com/145975390"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nancy López Luna</a> (MEX).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are performers who come from different backgrounds, cultures, and
dance styles.  Soon after meeting in 2014
we recognized that we share a unique talent to be successful dancers in the dance-specific art world, while also building a bridge from dance to everyday people in the form of workshops and movement research. Our mission is to combine our artistic and community work, using the body as a medium for
empowerment and change; it is how we participate in the world.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have worked together in Mexico, USA and Europe, and are currently internationally touring our first evening-length duet, <i><a href=""https://vimeo.com/130654615"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Whimsical</a>.  </i>Individually, we<span> have performed with international choreographer/master David Zambrano, been a finalist on the national television program ""Opera Prima"" (imagine ""So You Think You Can Dance?"" of Mexico), won ""Best Female Dancer"" in Mexico in 2014, taught at Mark Morris Dance Center and Cornish College of the Arts, one of 50 recipients of the Watson Fellowship nationwide, and multiple year-long fellowships from the Mexican government, FONCA. </span>In
2015, we were the only recipients from the Western Hemisphere for the ACASA
Residency in Sicily, Italy to teach and direct a new performance, <i style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://scenariopubblico.com/programmazione/eventi/164_walkabout.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Walkabout</a>.</i></p>
<p>Now, we are looking for support to produce our next dance/theater performance in 2016
– <i>Absence.</i></p>
<p>It is a dance/theater piece directed by renowned Mexican theater
director, Adrián Vásquez. It investigates the necessity of love through the
presence and disappearance of the other, <i>la ausencia. </i></p>
<p>This idea began in late 2014 when we connected with Adrián Vásquez in
Mexico City, after seeing his powerfully raw solo performance, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-vNGeISmss"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>El Hijo de Mi Padre</i></a> - which he also wrote and directed - based
on his childhood in the streets of Tijuana.  </p>
<p>We all met again in Mexico City in 2015, surrounded by a surge in
violence, and the murder of people known to Nancy and Adrián.  We were affected by those events and met
at his house to discuss how those emotions and thoughts could be transformed
into a performance.</p>
<p>We wanted to fuse our expressive physicality and experience in dance with
his world of theatrical storytelling - to tell a story that makes you laugh, cry, and reflect.</p>
<p>This project has 3 parts:</p>
<p>+ Creation process in Mexico City (February - April 2016)</p>
<p>+ Premier in Mexico City (April 2016)</p>
<p>+ Premier in Seattle (May 2016)</p>
<p>To produce this project, we need 100+ people, and 3 types of producers: “Producer”,
“Collaborator” and “Supporter.”  This is
our mechanism of producing this project through community.</p>
<p><b>The Funding</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The funding structure offers people an opportunity to
opt-in and support art production directly. Many things today are more
direct, and art production can leverage the same wave.  By producing this project, we can bypass institutional inefficiency; every dollar
will go directly towards the final artistic production.</p>
<p>And in turn, your support will be supported. We already have a
commitment from Producers in both countries - Steven Ripley (USA) and <a href=""http://www.ethnofit.com/studio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ethnofit</a> (Mexico) to help launch the project. </p>
<p><b>The Economics</b></p>
<p>We need $13,120.  This number is precise, because it will be
necessary to produce this project successfully in both Mexico and the USA. Your
support will produce:</p>
<p>+ director fee</p>
<p>+ dancer / co-creator fee</p>
<p>+ premiers in Mexico City and Seattle</p>
<p>+ theater rental</p>
<p>+ rehearsal studios</p>
<p>+ travel from Mexico to USA</p>
<p>+ production (costumes, assistant, etc.)</p>
<p>+ marketing and publicity</p>
<p>+ video documentation</p>

<br/>
<p>To cover these expenses, we need 3 types of producers:</p>
<p>1. <b>Producer</b> ($369 per

<p>We are Nancy López
Luna from Xalapa, Ver. México and Elia Mrak from Seattle, WA United
States. </p>
<p>Nancy is
passionate about the body’s capacity as a medium to transform energy. She began
her professional ballet training as a young girl, and in 2008 was part of the
company ""le Jeune Ballet du Quebec"" in Montreal, under Didier Chirpaz.  She later graduated from the University of
Veracruz, in contemporary dance and won a scholarship ""Instituto Superior""
to dance in Havana.  She has danced with
many renowned choreographers in Mexico and she won the scholarship ""Creadores
Escénicos 2013-14 del FONCA, México"" to produce her independent artistic
work.  In addition to performing and
creating, she teaches workshops, specifically one titled,
""Re-Conexiones"" influenced by the work she has done with renowned
psychoanalyst Sven Doehner.</p>
<p>In 2014, she won
the ""Premio Nacional"" - best female dancer in Mexico.</p>
<p>Elia<span> graduated with a degree in Mathematical Economics from
Pomona College in 2007, and was awarded the Watson Fellowship to pursue his
path through the body.  He went on to perform,
teach, and direct throughout the last decade of working in Europe, Central and
South America, and the USA. He includes in his list of masters: David Zambrano
(BELGIUM), Park Young-Cool (KOREA) and Break-dancer FeverOne
(USA/Rocksteady).  Learning from greats,
his practice now fuses Martial Arts, Breakdancing, Flying Low, and dramaturgy
of the theater.  Straddling the world of
dance and movement, he is a personal trainer and professional development
director, leading independent initiatives that build community through fun and
movement, and healthy lifestyle.</span></p>
<p>Presently, we dedicate
our training to movement exploration, improvisation, somatic practices, Qigong
(breathing and meditation), and traditional dance forms.  We dance, walk,
run, climb, and love to explore terrain in different forms.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2014 we established Los Porcupines as an artistic collaboration between Mexico and the USA.  Our larger overall mission includes teaching, directing, and building
bonds with different cultures and people through art.  Both of our unique
cultures are important to us, and working with the body to dissolve borders and
connect with people is essential.  Our
workshops focus on breath, movement, and musicality.  They have included: “Workshop for Womanhood”;
“Breakdancing for non-Breakdancers”; “Terrain”; “In-between Hands and Feet”;
“Horizontal/Vertical”; and “Re-Connections”. </p>

<p>Over the past few years photography has become a passion of mine.  During the summer, I decided to take my passion and make something of it.  Recently my photography was accepted in a local art show, Raw:Natural Born Artists in Raleigh.  I hope that this art show will help be the platform I need to jump start my career into photography.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>My goal is to raise $500.  Raw asks its artists to sell 20 $10 tickets. However many tickets go unsold, the artist must pay the difference.  Since the show is on a Wednesday night, and all of my family and many of my friends live far away, I doubt many people will be able to make it even if they wanted to.  Therefore, $200 will cover my entry fee into the show.  </p>
<p>The remaining $300 will cover the supplies I need for displaying and selling my photographs.  This includes printing (paper, ink, and printing lab costs), matting and framing prints, business cards, storage, etc.</p>
<p>Feel free to take a look at my work: <a href=""http://kadwellenz.smugmug.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://kadwellenz.smugmug.com/</a> </p>
<p>If you want to help support my photography, I want to give you something in return for your help.</p>
<p>If you give $10, I will send you a 5x7 glossy print of any photograph in my collection.</p>
<p>If you give $25, I will send you an 8x10 and a 5x7 glossy print of your choice.</p>
<p>If you are able to give $50 or more, I will send you either a fully matted ready to frame 8x10 glossy print or two 8x10 prints of your choice.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support.  </p>

</div><h2><b>The ""What""</b></h2>My name is Alex Huninghake. I'm an emerging artist from Louisville, KY.  I graduated this past winter from the University of Louisville with a BFA in printmaking and drawing. (My website here <a href=""www.alexhuninghake.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ALEX HUNINGHAKE</a>). I was recently invited to be the artist-in-residence at the Fundación Áce printmaking studio in Buenos Aires, Argentina this August. (Their website here: <a href=""http://www.proyectoace.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PROYECTO ACE</a>). In order to be accepted, I proposed a body of work called ""Spirit of Man."" Here's the concept:<br/>I intend to use visual signs and symbols to address the spiritual nature of modern man. I have become extremely interested in Buddhist meditation, exploring many Buddhist and mystical texts and recently carrying out a self-guided meditation retreat in the woods of Bardstown, KY. I’m interested in how traditional Eastern spiritual ideals have been adapted to 21st-century Western thought. Through my work, I intend to reflect on what the reemergence of these ancient ideas can tell us about the advancement of philosophical and metaphysical understanding. I will be using the classical male figure in dream-like scenes, juxtaposed with various historical and religious imagery. My process will consist of drawing, photography, silkscreen, and woodcutting.<br/><br/><h2>The ""Why""</h2>Artist-in-residence programs like this one are invaluable for young artists because they provide meaningful cultural exchange and an opportunity to explore and shape one's art practice in a new environment. At Áce, I'll be creating a special new body of work uniquely inspired by the sights, sounds, and people of Buenos Aires. This would be an exciting beginning to my creative career. It's a chance to make international contacts, work closely alongside artists from all over the world, and build my portfolio.<br/><br/><h2>The ""How""</h2>I'm looking to raise $4,000 folks! I can't make this happen without your help! <br/>So... where does your money go? The fee for the residency itself is around $3000 (not including the cost of airfare). This pays for my accommodation, studio space, instruction, (some) transportation, and weekly meals. $4,000 is the absolute minimum I'd have to raise to be able to go. But let's not stop there! Anything above that goal would not go to waste! I'll have to pay for weekend meals and travel, as well as art supplies and a plane ticket  ($1200 or so).  And if I'm lucky, I'll be able to combine my time at the residency with a brief backpacking trip around South America.<br/>I have two months to raise the money. If I'm successful, I'll leave Louisville around August 20th and return sometime in late September or early October. Help me get on that plane!<br/><br/><h2>The ""What('s in it for me?)""</h2>For each level of donation, I'll be offering a specific ""perk"" - a unique gift designed to match the value of your donation by the warmth it brings to your soul (as determined by me). Check 'em out! <br/>A note:<br/>I'll also be raising money by selling prints and accepting donations privately (not through Indiegogo). If you're interested, please email me at alexhuninghake8@gmail.com<br/><br/>THANK YOU! <br/><p></p></div>","The ""What""My name is Alex Huninghake.

This pays for my accommodation, studio space, instruction, (some) transportation, and weekly meals. $4,000 is the absolute minimum I'd have to raise to be able to go. But let's not stop there! Anything above that goal would not go to waste! I'll have to pay for weekend meals and travel, as well as art supplies and a plane ticket  ($1200 or so).  And if I'm lucky, I'll be able to combine my time at the residency with a brief backpacking trip around South America.I have two months to raise the money. If I'm successful, I'll leave Louisville around August 20th and return sometime in late September or early October. Help me get on that plane!The ""What('s in it for me?)""For each level of donation, I'll be offering a specific ""perk"" - a unique gift designed to match the value of your donation by the warmth it brings to your soul (as determined by me). Check 'em out! A note:I'll also be raising money by selling prints and accepting donations privately (not through Indiegogo). If you're interested, please email me at alexhuninghake8@gmail.comTHANK YOU!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Chris Meier and I am a Midwest Maker. I study graphic design at the Kansas City Art Institute and on the side I like to print using printmaking/screen printing techniques. I like to think that in the future I will be able to work for myself and run my own professional printing operation using the principles of graphic design and techniques of printmaking. 
And this is the big first step. 


So What's the Plan?
To keep it short and sweet, we want create a small print workspace complete with a four color press for shirts, a poster printing station for paper prints,  an exposure unit/light table for exposing screens and making designs, as well as a dark room for storage of screens and coating screens.
We want to put this all in my apartment and turn the space into something productive and useful. Efficient and personal. New and Exciting.
A partner of mine DJ Morris will be aiding me in building and printing as well. He knows the in's and out's of construction, making things work, and properly, efficiently, and safely building everything.

What We Print
We print a lot of different things, and we would be using the space and equipment to print even more! Shirts, blocks, posters, anything we can we will try to print when we get this new equipment!

Below is some stuff we used to print when our press was up and running.

   
  
 

Here are some refined prints that are more recent.
   



Experimentation
We really want this space so that we can experiment with print techniques! Shirts, posters, postcards, etc. We have a lot of ideas cooking in the oven and can't wait to start trying to print on different fabrics, papers, surfaces, etc. 


Establishing a Brand
We also want to establish a brand and grow. We would want to print Midwest themed clothes, fun iconic imagery, catchy slogans and sayings, typographic compositions, and establish some Midwest pride and continue to make this area proud! The Midwest is the next big place to be and right now it is the best kept secret. 



What We Have
We already have the four color press actually! So check that one off the list. BUT it does need some repairs for it has taken some damage over the years and we need to tune it up a little.
We also already have some screens, inks, squeegees, and the other basic printmaking equipment. As well as tools for building everything, but we can always use more.




(this is our current press)
   What We Need Recently I was awarded 400 dollars from a grant from KCAI. This 400 is a really good starting point for us. But it is going to cost more than that, especially if we want to do it the right way! 
We are asking for another 600 dollars so we can make sure we have enough money for professional equipment for our exposure unit and dark room, as well as all the other little things like materials that tend to add up in the long run.
Some other things that would be helpful for us and are factored in the 600


more screens - the more the merrier. (100)

   Why Should YOU Care?

<h2>Greetings from Madelyn &amp; Scott of 2011 World Champion Team LivingBrush Bodypainting</h2>
<h3>Hello, dear friends and fans of our work.<strong> </strong>
</h3>
<p>Many of you are here because you know us personally, in real life or by virtue of the web. If you have arrived by other means, we encourage you to view <strong>LivingBrush Bodypainting's</strong> <a href=""http://www.livingbrush.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">work</a> and familiarize yourself with the joy &amp; beauty we bring forth on our living, human canvases.</p>
<p>As a team, we have achieved notoriety as American Artists on a global stage in our brief, but illustrious competitive career. This includes capturing a 2010 2nd Place at The World Bodypainting Festival in our second ever competition, then winning it <strong>ALL</strong> in 2011, with <strong>1st Place honors</strong> at both <strong>The North American Bodypaint Competition</strong> and <strong>The World Bodypainting Festival in Portschach, Austria</strong>.</p>
<p>It has been an <strong>AMAZING</strong> year representing our chosen artistic passion as World Champions of the discipline and the opportunities that title has afforded, as a result. Encouraged to excel, we have devoted study and energy toward competing in a <strong>NEW</strong> category (Special Effects) and have truly felt universal confirmation of this choice, as incredible new friends and teachers have arrived in our lives to lend a hand toward this goal.</p>
<p><strong>This brings us to YOU and why we've invited you here.</strong></p>
<p>In 2010, our good fortune brought us a benefactor who could help defray the (otherwise prohibitively expensive) cost of travel in our bid to become the new World Champions. This person believed fully in the quality of our art and our heart-and-soul dedication to our craft and wanted us to have the chance to prove it. I am extremely grateful to be able to say we did it!</p>
<p>This year, we similarly need a financial boost, not necessarily from one person, but spread among many who believe in us. It will be your belief that carries us forward, on a tide of faith and good feelings, to bring our art to the world! With your help, we can return to <strong>Austria</strong> for <strong>The 2012 World Bodypainting Festival</strong> in July and also travel to <strong>Daegu, South Korea</strong> for <strong>The 2012 Daegu International Bodypainting Festival</strong> in August/September.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we need/What you get</h3>
<p>We have set our campaign goal at an achievable $2500, a figure that covers one-forth of our expenses associated with the international travel costs of both competitions. Certainly, <strong>we need help</strong> to realize our dream, but are covering as much as we can with Scott's full-time job and Madelyn's four part-time ones.</p>
<p><strong>EVERYONE </strong>who donates at <strong>ANY</strong> level is invited to a <strong>big celebration</strong> featuring photography, video, music, live storytelling detailing our adventures and featuring a live bodypainting. This will happen in NC, USA, date/time TBA.</p>
<p><strong>READ ON </strong>for perks at other donation levels - fun for everyone!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our joy multiplied by you, impacts everyone!</strong></h3>
<p>Have you enjoyed our work in a live performance setting? In a gallery? On the web?</p>
<p>Have you been painted by us or know someone who has?</p>
<p>Have you ever heard one of our real stories of how bodypainting has literally and powerfully changed someone's perception of themselves, bringing a gift of self-worth and healing, not previously conceived of.</p>
<p>If you feel <strong>our creativity adds value</strong> to our society, your life, or the lives of others, please <strong>help foster our growth into the world</strong> and feel good about your contribution.</p>

Radoslav has been already dealing with 3D graphics, retouching, photomontage, photography and digital production for 13 years now. He made use of his experience and sense of detail, colour and composition and became successful in his commercial career. However, after more than 60 commercial projects he would like to create something unique, something more focused on the art and collaboration with other artistic industries and help the students get into a proffesional creative process.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>TEAM:</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://download.radoxist.com/Raft_of_the_Medusa/indiegogo/rado_picture.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Radoslav Žilinský</strong>, fascinated with the art and the document about the French painter Theodor Gericault, decided to reconstruct the painter’s masterpiece The Raft of the Medusa. This masterpiece from 19th century depicts real story, which deserves more attention but unfortunately got behind the shadow of more famous Titanic. Using new techniques of the 21st century (photographing, 3D graphics, photomontage), our goal is to make this situation more realistic and appealing, without harming original conception in the sense of “learning from old maestros”.</p>
<p>Radoslav leads this project as an art director and organizer of it all. In the end, he will put everything together into one digital piece.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>It is impossible to create such a massive reconstruction, so he invited other artists to participate on this project</em><strong>   </strong></p>
<p><strong>Peter Spurný – </strong>Slovak photographer, who provides his atelier for this complicated photo shooting and also contributes with his experience and advice.</p>

<p><strong>Martin Jankovič</strong> – professional film make-up artist, who has more than 10-year experience in his work. His task is to make-up our models/sailors to look the most realistic in the photography – from scars, skin toning, fake beards and wigs to bruises and sunburns. He will also have an assistant – his long-standing colleague and a student of visage at the Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ľubomír Bercel</strong> – works as an art director in the foremost advertising agencies. In this project he will be the person covering the whole art direction.</p>

<h1>How will be the students involved?</h1>
<p class=""normalnytextraftu"">The students represent the next part of philosophy of “learning from old maestros”. They will assist in their specialization and they will have the chance to learn from the professionals participating in this project. It would be great experience for them to work on a real project and they can reach/get more knowledge useful in their future.</p>
<p class=""normalnytextraftu""> </p>
<h1>How will the creative process run?</h1>
<p class=""normalnytextraftu"">Immediately after fulfilling the budget, the project will run  according to on the basis of these points:</p>
<p><strong>1 – Selection of models</strong> - One of the most important steps in the project is the selection of the right men, who will embody individual sailors in the picture. Selection will be realized through casting and choosing in several competent classes of men - fencers, dancers, etc. Our intention is to find men with realistic attributes of models - muscularity, gracility, sinewiness, long hair and beard.</p>
<p><strong>2 – Costume production</strong> – after finding the adequate models, the creation of suitable costumes follow. Sewing and arranging is very important - patination of clothes and costume fitting.</p>
<p class=""normalnytextraftu""><strong>3 – Photo-shooting</strong> – due to the great amount of sailors in the picture, the photography is divided into four installments/days, each day for five people. The particular photography always consists of:</p>
<p class=""normalnytextraftu"">- Film make-up, patination, hair dressing, putting scars, bruises, sunburns, beards and so on</p>
<p class=""normalnytextraftu"">- Costume fitting, dressing and arranging</p>
<p class=""normalnytextraftu"">- Preparation of lights, perspective and composition of models according to the picture</p>
<p class=""normalnytextraftu"">- Photography itself and the recording on quality digital cameras</p>
<p><strong>4 – Making the 3D model of the raft</strong>– It starts during previous phases of the project. It consists of 3D modelling of the raft and sails, lighting, texturing and making of realistic materials. Final photorealistic picture will be prepared for composition with photographed material.</p>
<p><strong>5 – Composition of the final artwork – </strong>The final composition of the sailors photographed together with the realistic 3D model of raft and other photos will serve as a basis for the creation of sea and sky. This phase includes colour grading, cutting the models from photos, retouching, photomontage and matte painting in using 2D composition software.</p>
<p class=""normalnytextraftu""> </p>
<h1>What is the output of your creative process and what use does it have?</h1>
<p> </p>
<p class=""normalnytextraftu"">The final output of our creative process will be a digital picture in high resolution, usable in large-size print. Our primary purpose is to place the picture in a large format to one of the modern galleries in Slovakia or in the world. The picture can be used also in whatever size or format in different ways - whether in post-cards, posters, canvases or walls.</p>

<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>I'm running a half marathon really soon to help to raise some funds for the Curtin 2012 Fine Art Degree Show (of which I am a participant - exciting). The show runs every year for graduating art students and raising money to pull it off is always an enormous task, so every little bit makes all the difference. The show is almost entirely student funded and money goes towards designing and printing the grad show yearbook, installation costs and catering.</p>
<p>Since fine art students tirelessly pour their hearts and souls into their work, for generally very little financial gain while enriching the cultural capital of our city, I think it is a great opportunity to show our appreciation to these wonderfully creative people. Please help by making a small contribution and give them a leg up as they attempt to enter the extremely competitive art world careers.</p>
<p>Of course you are all invited to come and see the art show show which takes place in November at Curtin University. More details soon!</p>
<p>Best of all, you get to see me work my guts out over a pretty hilly half marathon course on the 26th August.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Coaccession's Story</h3>
<p>Especially today, arts funding falls far short of fully supporting the arts... but then, arts funding hasn't begun fully mobilizing the value of artworks.  Sure, arts funding has used the cultural value of artworks to attract cash donations, but those donations hardly ever fully endow programs.  For full endowments, arts funding has to use the financial value of artworks as well as their cultural value.  The challenge is mobilizing their financial value to enhance their cultural value, not diminish it.  <b>Coaccession</b> meets that challenge.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Coaccession lets community members invest in artworks held by cultural institutions.  An artwork investment gives a community member the right to store that artwork for the institution whenever the institution decides to store it.  The institution has all rights other than storage, so it's as free to exhibit, research and conserve the artwork as it ever was, but instead of the stored artwork taking up space in the institution's basement, it's proudly out in the community at a member's home or office or church or school -- wherever the member and guests can enjoy it most while securing its longevity.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Community member investments in artworks fund the institution's cash endowment, adding to the capital income that supports its mission.  The institution no longer gets much capital appreciation from the artwork -- nearly all that goes to the community member making the investment -- but then, capital appreciation doesn't pay the bills that institutions have to pay and doesn't fund the programs that enhance the artwork's cultural value.  Capital appreciation does, however, let the community member save for the future with great social responsibility -- after all, when you invest in gold you stimulate gold mining, but when you invest in artworks you stimulate artistry, and when you invest in artworks whose cultural rights belong to cultural institutions, your investment provides capital income that lets them enhance the cultural value of your artworks.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you want the arts fully funded in your community, and your community's cultural institutions have important artwork collections, your best donation now goes to start Coaccession up so those institutions can mobilize the financial value of those collections to enhance their cultural value to the community.  That financial value leverages your donation so it has an impact far in excess of its own cash value.  </p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Coaccession's Impact</h3>
<p>Coaccession, as a new financial tool for cultural institutions, can increase exhibition, publication and conservation funding for artworks, giving communities greater opportunities for cultural appreciation.   Coaccession, as a new storage tool for cultural institutions, can increase community access to artworks at homes, offices, churches, schools, etc., also giving communities greater opportunities for cultural appreciation with community access to museum pieces that might otherwise go years, even decades, buried in basements without being seen.  Given the tight arts funding since the financial crisis began, the lack of these novel tools contributes to decreased exhibitions, publications and conservation.  You can help turn that around because cultural institutions really do have a lot more resources available than the ones they currently use.  Give them the tools to cultivate all their resources, rather than leaving the bulk of their financial and community resources sterilized.  Then enjoy what they do with their expanded capacity!</p>

<h3>What <font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3"">Coaccession</font> Needs &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3>
<p>Coaccession is just starting up.  More than anything, it needs a big client able to intelligently sort through the many options for implementation to set standards for itself and follow-on institutions.  It needs Detroit and the Detroit Institute of Arts collection, where a year of capital appreciation runs into tens of millions of dollars and the corresponding capital income can fund arts programs throughout the city and its schools.  Having that client leads to standards, a recognized registry, legal briefs, court enforcement, etc., etc.   Coaccession needs $7500 so its inventor, Mark White, can effectively commit to be in Detroit often enough and long enough to give Coaccession the visibility that can restore arts funding in that city.  This is serious.  The mayor has proposed zeroing out city funding for the DIA.  With Coaccession, the City and DIA could generate enough capital income to not only replace city funding, but fund new exhibitions, publications, and conservation as well as arts outreach to bring Detroiters to DIA's programs, and on top of that, fund the essential city services that help Detroiters stay in the city to benefit from the programs.  That's the kind of leverage your donations can generate when Coaccession lets artworks fund the arts in a city with a museum as wealthy as the DIA.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Pro bono services have already created draft legal documents encoding the Coaccession vision.  Now it's time to take that vision where it's clearly needed, and that starts with Detroit and then expands to your community with established standards.

Coaccession's Story
Especially today, arts funding falls far short of fully supporting the arts... but then, arts funding hasn't begun fully mobilizing the value of artworks.  Sure, arts funding has used the cultural value of artworks to attract cash donations, but those donations hardly ever fully endow programs.  For full endowments, arts funding has to use the financial value of artworks as well as their cultural value.  The challenge is mobilizing their financial value to enhance their cultural value, not diminish it.  Coaccession meets that challenge.

Coaccession lets community members invest in artworks held by cultural institutions.  An artwork investment gives a community member the right to store that artwork for the institution whenever the institution decides to store it.  The institution has all rights other than storage, so it's as free to exhibit, research and conserve the artwork as it ever was, but instead of the stored artwork taking up space in the institution's basement, it's proudly out in the community at a member's home or office or church or school -- wherever the member and guests can enjoy it most while securing its longevity.

Im here to ask for your help in getting me money raised so I can get major promotions done for my music. Im from Newport News, Virginia where there is little to do and the hope is at a all time high. I happened to be an artist that alot of people in my area believe in and they want to see me succeed in the music business. I know if I was to get a major record deal or even major placement on things with my music people in my state/city will be joyful and start to believe in themselves. I know belief is a powerful tool. I want to lead by example and showing them if I did it you can do it too. </p><p>here is a little biography of what I have down on my own grind and money.</p><p>T-DUBB, born Timothy White is a native of Newport News, Virginia, he is a rap artist with a very unique rap style. His style is a blend of Southern and East Coast Hip Hop. He has a very energetic rap style that will get you out of your seat and have you saying ""I'm Fresh"" or have you glad you're ""Back In Da Hood"". He tells finely detailed stories with his rhymes. DJ Jack of Spade from 103 Jamz has quoted this about T-DUBB's music, ""This is the type of music we make in V.A."". <br/><br/>T-DUBB has had multiple songs such as Haters Gone Hate, They Tell Me, I'm Fresh, Do You Love Me, Bad Newz Connections, Show Me, From the Block to the Top, We Like the Cars, Gone Shake It Girl, They Know, Back On My B.S, and Blow That Money aired on a few of his local radio stations, such as 103 Jamz (VA), 91.1 (VA), Hot 102.1 (VA), 89.9 (Elizabeth City, NC), 101.1 The Fam (VA) &amp; World Wide Radio (wwradio.net). He's currently getting radio play in clubs, online and fm radio stations around the world. T-DUBB has won multiple talent contests in Virginia which led to the opportunity to open up for The Keyshia Cole's ""This Is Me Tour"", Yung LA, Boyz II Men, Young Leek, Lil Scrappy, Dem Franchise Boyz, Young Buck, and The SMES Awards. T-DUBB has been featured on web sites such as VASwagger.com, VATalent.com, mp3waxx.com, wwradio.net, RocktheMic.ning.com, CorlinaAllDay.com, Coast2coastmixtapes.com, Dmusic.com, covebiz.webs.com, <a href=""http://www.ddotomen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ddotomen.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.nme.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nme.com</a>, and more.</p><p>In the year 2007, T-DUBB was nominated at the Blendzville Awards for Best Producer, nominated at the Hood Platinum Awards for Best Group when he was grouped with Black Spadez, and Best Record Label with Lightz Out Entertainment at the VA Unity Awards. He won ""Best Hit Single"" at the 2009 Blendzville Awards and was nominated for 4 others. He also performs at the East End Day Parade every year in the East End area of Newport News which is an event that celebrates the achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and promote unity within the community of East End Newport News. <br/><br/>Not only is T-DUBB a rap artist he is also a CEO of his own music company and management company to help other artist get exposure, engineer of a recording studio, graphic designer, and produce instrumentals from time to time. He sets out to be the person that shows the world that Virginia has a lot of talent no longer waiting to be seen and heard. He feels there are some very talented entertainers from Virginia that made it mainstream, but there is still so many other talented individuals looking for the opportunity to make it to the major scene. To him Lightz Out Entertainment and T&amp;C Management are tools to showcase what Virginia has to offer within his team of people. Not only does he want to get into the mainstream music industry, but he also has a clothing line in the works which will open up opportunities for models and designers to be showcased and help out their careers. He also plans to venture out into other opportunities when the time is right. <br/><br/>In the year 2013, T-DUBB was offered a position on 101.1 The Fam (Internet Radio) based in Richmond,VA as a radio personality. He gladly accepted the position because he knows it could bring a bigger following to his movement. Since then he has brought a greater audience to the radio station like they never had before. From being a radio personality he has had the opportunity to interview DJ Lord Jazz from The Lords of The Underground, Donald D and Dynamax of Ice-T's Bronx Rhyme Syndicate/Zulu Nation, and many unsigned/independent artist looking game exposure and fans. He even had the chance to do a remix of his song ""Haters Gone Hate"" with Donald D and Dynamax from being a radio personality. You can catch The Unsigned Power Hour hosted by T-DUBB on air every Monday (9p-10p E.S.T.), Tuesday (9p-10p E.S.T.), and Friday (7p-10p E.S.T.) on<a href=""http://www.1011thefam.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.1011TheFam.org</a> helping artist get heard on his show. He also host his own events throughout Virginia for unsigned artist to perform at to better their crafts. <br/><br/>T-DUBB feels music is just another way to tell a story. Who doesn't like to hear a good story? Music is his way of getting the problems he has faced in his life off his chest. He also loves to party so when it comes to party music T-DUBB has it for you. His hard hitting southern style beats and his rap flow just makes you want to get loose in the club. T-DUBB is on a mission to show the world what he has to offer and will not stop until he feels his story is told.</p><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>With your help I can get my music shopped around proffesional with Traskz Entertainment Group (Grammy Nominated). I will be able to get my music in the right hands in order to help my music succeed to the major level. I will never give up on my dreams of being in the majors and inspiring others to follow their dreams. If I dont meet this goal in raising the money I will continue to keep trying and doing other things to raise the money. I believe in myself and I know I can inspire the uninspired.</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>I feel music is the way to your soul and I know I have a story to tell that will make people want to change for the better. Im from the projects so I know what it feels like to not have a role model to believe in locally.

<h3>Hey guys! :)</h3>
<p>So, I created this campaign to ask for your help, but also give something in return! I'm not a fan of just asking for money. </p>
<p>Anyway, here's why I created this campaign.</p>
<p>In January, two teenage males entered my home and stole $450 worth of stuff from me. This included: my brand new Xbox 360 with a 250gb hard drive, power cords, wires, controllers, my Kinect sensor and a game disc. (Black Ops) </p>
<p>The police have yet to do anything about it, and I have come to believe my hard-earned money that I put into buying all of this equipment is lost. I'm a college student, I don't make much money...it took me a good 5 months to save that money (while having to pay for plenty else), and in all but 10 minutes 2 teenagers took that away from me. </p>
<p>I've been trying to save up for a new one, or a different system, but just recently one of my horses fell deathly ill. She was in the intensive care unit for days, and we thought she was a goner. She pulled through, but barely. Unfortunately for me, that means a pricey vet bill will be coming in my mail in the next few weeks, which will push back my plans even more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I'm asking you guys is:</p>
<p>I am asking for donations to help me out here, but I'm going to give back!</p>
<p>I do a lot of artsy stuff, and I hope you have seen it...because that's going to be my way of giving back to you for helping me out. </p>
<p>Any donation over $10 will be getting a head portrait of themselves from me. </p>
<p>Any donation over $30 will get a drawing of whatever they want! </p>
<p>Does that sound alright to you?</p>
<p>If you want something else, we can always talk it over :) I'm open to suggestions! That is, if you think my art is boring or terrible...well....we can figure something out. </p>
<p>REMEMBER: YOU MUST CLAIM A PERK TO GET A PORTRAIT. If you want to come back and give mocan you can. :) </p>
<p>I really appreciate you guys taking the time to read this, and I hope you'll help a lady out. If you can only give a few bucks, I'll make sure to find something to do for you. Whether it be a hug or I'll buy you a cheeseburger or something. :P</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks so much for all your help, and I look forward to hearing from you!!</p>
<p>P.S. I put $600 because IndieGoGo charges a percentage, and I just want to make sure I've got a certain amount! :)</p>

<p>We are planning a 3 day art event which will evoke an emotional response to the questions of LOVE. The collection of works will run the gamete from classical paintings to digital and video installations. There will be art for all the senses from your eyes and ears to the tactile, with music, performances and experiences beyond your imagination. SHE LOVES is an all encompassing assemblage of multimedia artists, all based on the affairs of the heart.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your plan, and what’s your schedule?  </strong></p>
<p> The Installation exhibit will take place from February 10-12, 2017 at the Honeypot LA, 212 W 12th St, Los Angeles, CA 90015. February 9th, will be dedicated to the artists installing the exhibits and having light and sound crews do all checks. All three days will feature a different one time only attraction. All backers will receive their incentive gifts by March 1, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>what are we looking for?</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for supporters for this exhibit who can help us to bridge the financial gap of $10,000 to complete this project by securing our location, and to ensure that we can deliver a truly exceptional experience. We have done all in our power to make sure that the event can take place but with your help we can make it a reality. The money will be spent on location of our first 3 day exhibit, materials needed to complete some of the installations and creating a record ( that means video ) that we can use as a tool to represent the collective so this exhibit may travel in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What If We Get More? </strong> </p>
<p>If we were to get more, e.g. $20,000 or 30,000 then the collective would start planning cities to visit, and second stages of the collective</p>
<p><strong>Why should you care? </strong></p>
<p>Women are faced with making choices of love, for love and about love on a daily basis and are confronted with the contradictions of these choices. SHE LOVES art exhibit provides a platform for these women artists to start a dialogue with the viewer and hence a dialogue with their community on the subject of love. We hope to break gender stereotypes and social expectations for women ( in the arts ) by demonstrating the power of mutual support coupled with compelling artistic expression. With your donation you too can be a patron of the arts and be a part of the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>gratitude</strong></p>
<p>She Loves Collective wishes to thank their videographer, Robert Nazar Arjoyan, their photographer, Jake Hagopian and their music DJ Armen Mesropian.</p>
<p>Special thanks to our loved ones Armen Baghdassarian, Mel Saroyan, Hilma Shahinian, Monique Paredes, Armen Grigorian, Armond Baghdassarian, Josh Gutier, Armen Mesrobian and Kelly Benson.</p>

 The Installation exhibit will take place from February 10-12, 2017 at the Honeypot LA, 212 W 12th St, Los Angeles, CA 90015. February 9th, will be dedicated to the artists installing the exhibits and having light and sound crews do all checks. All three days will feature a different one time only attraction. All backers will receive their incentive gifts by March 1, 2017.
what are we looking for?
We are looking for supporters for this exhibit who can help us to bridge the financial gap of $10,000 to complete this project by securing our location, and to ensure that we can deliver a truly exceptional experience. We have done all in our power to make sure that the event can take place but with your help we can make it a reality. The money will be spent on location of our first 3 day exhibit, materials needed to complete some of the installations and creating a record ( that means video ) that we can use as a tool to represent the collective so this exhibit may travel in the future.
What If We Get More?  
If we were to get more, e.g. $20,000 or 30,000 then the collective would start planning cities to visit, and second stages of the collective
Why should you care? 
Women are faced with making choices of love, for love and about love on a daily basis and are confronted with the contradictions of these choices. SHE LOVES art exhibit provides a platform for these women artists to start a dialogue with the viewer and hence a dialogue with their community on the subject of love. We hope to break gender stereotypes and social expectations for women ( in the arts ) by demonstrating the power of mutual support coupled with compelling artistic expression. With your donation you too can be a patron of the arts and be a part of the conversation.

In a couple of weeks, on Sunday November 9, I'll be running the Beirut Marathon 10K in support of the Lebanese Autism Society (LAS). 

My goal is to have a blast and help raise awareness and funds for LAS while I'm at it. And here's where I need your support! Right now, my aim is to reach $1000 by the time I race. Any contribution, no matter how little it is, can go a long way!

<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
goals of my project are to organize and launch a series of exhibitions in   four
Ukrainian cities  (Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv,
and Vinnytsia), and promote my published in September 2013 poetry book ""Dzen.UA"". I also plan to perform poetry
readings at the openings of each exhibition. It will be a big event Ukrainian
modern art.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most
of the paintings for the art exhibitions have been already made. They depict some
of Ukrainian landscape. The paintings are made in oil on canvas, cardboards,
and fibreboards. There are about 100 artworks altogether. I plan to paint 20
– 30 more large landscapes on canvas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In
addition, in my plans – to print a series of exclusive postcards and bookmarks
using the themes of my paintings. They will be distributed during the
exhibitions and poetic readings. It is prearranged to make the postcards in two
sizes – 4х6 inch and 5x7 inch, and bookmarks – 2x7 inch (with autograph,
limited edition, entirely handmade).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
exhibitions are planned to be hold during the spring 2014. Specific dates
depend on the schedule of the art galleries. Nonetheless, the events will take
place in March – May. Therefore, the project should be completed by the end of May.
This is a great art event and all the paintings will be used as rewards for
backers! Once the exhibitions are completed, everything will be sent to the backers
of this project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p>It's done! Now when
the ""Dzen.UA"" is almost
ready, I need your support to be able to share this ambitious project far and
wide. I want to create a global dialog about art. Art should be for everyone.
This is a big undertaking but I am up to it. I <span>am </span>obsessive perfectionist.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Ukrainians feel a huge pressure on native language and Ukrainian book publishing.
Thus the goal of my project is to draw attention to this problem. Ukraine is an
independent country for 22 years. But up to now, national culture does not
receive appropriate support from the government. Cultural and art projects and
events should highlight such issues and minimize them. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Art is an universal tool for better understanding not
only between people but also between nations. The Ukrainian language and art
are an important part of development of Ukrainian national consciousness.
Ukraine is an European country!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/290867/files/20140104083748-_2.jpg?1388853468"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">

My name is Sergiy Tatchyn. I'm Ukrainian artist and poet.Facebook (public)      II     My site     II     Dzen.UA     II      Facebook (personal)Large-Scale-Project Presentation!

The
goals of my project are to organize and launch a series of exhibitions in   four
Ukrainian cities  (Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv,
and Vinnytsia), and promote my published in September 2013 poetry book ""Dzen.UA"". I also plan to perform poetry
readings at the openings of each exhibition. It will be a big event Ukrainian
modern art.
Most
of the paintings for the art exhibitions have been already made. They depict some
of Ukrainian landscape. The paintings are made in oil on canvas, cardboards,
and fibreboards. There are about 100 artworks altogether. I plan to paint 20
– 30 more large landscapes on canvas.
In
addition, in my plans – to print a series of exclusive postcards and bookmarks
using the themes of my paintings. They will be distributed during the
exhibitions and poetic readings. It is prearranged to make the postcards in two
sizes – 4х6 inch and 5x7 inch, and bookmarks – 2x7 inch (with autograph,
limited edition, entirely handmade).
The
exhibitions are planned to be hold during the spring 2014. Specific dates
depend on the schedule of the art galleries. Nonetheless, the events will take
place in March – May. Therefore, the project should be completed by the end of May.
This is a great art event and all the paintings will be used as rewards for
backers! Once the exhibitions are completed, everything will be sent to the backers
of this project.
It's done! Now when
the ""Dzen.UA"" is almost
ready, I need your support to be able to share this ambitious project far and
wide. I want to create a global dialog about art. Art should be for everyone.
This is a big undertaking but I am up to it. I am obsessive perfectionist.Nowadays, Ukrainians feel a huge pressure on native language and Ukrainian book publishing.
Thus the goal of my project is to draw attention to this problem. Ukraine is an
independent country for 22 years. But up to now, national culture does not
receive appropriate support from the government. Cultural and art projects and
events should highlight such issues and minimize them. 
Art is an universal tool for better understanding not
only between people but also between nations. The Ukrainian language and art
are an important part of development of Ukrainian national consciousness.
Ukraine is an European country!

The book was published in September 2013 by the publishing house ""Green Dog"" in Kyiv. Black and white, hardcover, 248 pages, many illustrations (ISBN 978-966-1515-92-4).The funds for developing the project required about $17,800Money will be divided as follows:1. rent art galleries in four cities - $52002. packaging, insurance and transportation artworks - $12003. paints and materials for 20 large artworks - $12004. travel and accommodation - $8005. presentation and promotion of poetry book - $5006. production and dispatch rewards - about 25% of the project.7. taxes and unplanned expenses - about 25% of the project.What if I raise more than the funding goal?

No worries! I prepared ahead of time
for prompt fulfillment of this project's rewards. Unlike many other IndieGoGo
campaigns that may still be in the idea phase, this project has already been in
production for four years. 
All paintings
will be granted as rewards, depending on the size of contribution. They are all
original work executed in oil. I promise that everyone will get their rewards in the timely
matter. 
If
the amount of the project will be exceeded, then it is great, I am counting on
it. In that case, I will have spare money to hold several more exhibitions, as
well as to improve my art studio, because it is too small for painting large artworks.
Or I will have an opportunity to build a new one – bright and spacious! 
There
are no risks, because almost all paintings are ready, or will be completed
soon. Postcards and bookmarks will be printed as soon as the project ends.I
assure you that this
project will be completed precisely and with high quality.
By contributing money you pursue two goals –
supporting the development of art and receiving exclusive artworks. No one will
be left without a reward! Unless Genesis Flood might occur! But once the water
goes down, I will immediately send rewards to all backers of this project!)I put at stake my reputation, name, and integrity by bringing this project to your attention!Have a question? If the info above doesn't help, you can ask the project creator directly. dzenua@i.ua",50.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Maravilla Handball Court was built brick by brick by the 
local community in 1923.  It is the oldest surviving handball court in 
East Los Angeles.  For decades, the court and the attached grocery 
served as a site for sport, recreation, and community gatherings.  Facing the threat of

 The
 Maravilla Historical Society has been doing great work and has even

Through our degree we have been put in touch with students from Bergen National Academy of the Arts: an art school in Norway. Our aim is to create artwork with, alongside or in response to the artistic practices of these students by travelling to Bergen.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><font>We intend on visiting their Academy for five days, in which time they have very kindly offered to put us up in their own houses and apartments. We will get to know them both as individuals and as a group and see what kind of art we can create together. This process has already begun through a joint blog entitled WHAT MATTERS? Please feel free to view examples of our current work and an ongoing conversation that is beginning to formulate:</font></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><u><br/><font color=""#0000ff""></font></u></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><font>We will be putting on an exhibition to display the work we create, both in galleries and art spaces whilst we are away as well as possible further exhibitions or publications once we return to the UK. There is a chance we will be able to exhibit in a gallery run by one of our own university tutors, which is in an incredible location in Norway – atop a mountain!</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><font>We need enough money to get the 7 students in our UK group return flights to Bergen during April 2011. This will enable this unique project to take place, which will in turn ignite new relationships, a new way of working for many of us, and ultimately a really exciting exhibition(s) for the public to enjoy as the result of our trip.</font></p>

<p align=""center"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><font>THANKYOU</font></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p><font>Being students, unfortunately we cannot all afford the full cost of the trip. As we are kindly being housed by the Norwegian students, our expenses when we are out there will be for food, travel and art materials. The flights are the real cost we are struggling with and therefore asking for your help with. This trip is taking place just over a month before our final deadline for our University degree, which in itself will incur some substantial costs (you can view our degree show website here: <a href=""http://www.fineartdegreeshow.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.fineartdegreeshow.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fineartdegreeshow.info/</a>). </font></p>

</div></div>","Bergen · Nottingham · Nottingham · Bergen

We are a group of final year Fine Art students from Nottingham Trent University, UK. Through our degree we have been put in touch with students from Bergen National Academy of the Arts: an art school in Norway. Our aim is to create artwork with, alongside or in response to the artistic practices of these students by travelling to Bergen.

We intend on visiting their Academy for five days, in which time they have very kindly offered to put us up in their own houses and apartments. We will get to know them both as individuals and as a group and see what kind of art we can create together. This process has already begun through a joint blog entitled WHAT MATTERS? Please feel free to view examples of our current work and an ongoing conversation that is beginning to formulate:

http://whatmatters-matters.tumblr.com/

We will be putting on an exhibition to display the work we create, both in galleries and art spaces whilst we are away as well as possible further exhibitions or publications once we return to the UK. There is a chance we will be able to exhibit in a gallery run by one of our own university tutors, which is in an incredible location in Norway – atop a mountain!

We need enough money to get the 7 students in our UK group return flights to Bergen during April 2011. This will enable this unique project to take place, which will in turn ignite new relationships, a new way of working for many of us, and ultimately a really exciting exhibition(s) for the public to enjoy as the result of our trip.

THANKYOU
The Impact

Being students, unfortunately we cannot all afford the full cost of the trip. As we are kindly being housed by the Norwegian students, our expenses when we are out there will be for food, travel and art materials. The flights are the real cost we are struggling with and therefore asking for your help with. This trip is taking place just over a month before our final deadline for our University degree, which in itself will incur some substantial costs (you can view our degree show website here: http://www.fineartdegreeshow.info/). 
Anything you can give us is a massive help in allowing us to make the most of a unique international opportunity.


What We Need & What You Get  

  
The flights are priced at around $133 return each, and so with a group of 7 of us going this comes to $930. These are the cheapest flights we could find for the time the Bergen students could host us. If we don't reach our entire goal the money we have raised will be divided equally between the 7 of us, helping to ease the financial burden of this incredible experience. Each student is currently doing their best to raise funds from family, friends, pennies down the back of the sofa to afford the other costs while we are out there, but this campaign is at the core of our endeavours.
So, to help you along the way in aiding our trip, we are providing some fun and unique incentives in return for your dollars!

You may saying to yourself ""why are they raising money... isn't the Spire of Fire already built?""  

Yes... the Spire of Fire is built and you may have even seen it at one of the following events:


Burning Man (Black Rock City, NV 2010)

The simple answer is PROPANE... propane, propane, propane.  She drinks it as fast as the DPW guzzles PBR and Jameson at Early Burn.  When the Spire is in full operation she consumes 3 gallons of propane per minute... you read that right... 3 gallons per ""minute"".  Last year the price per gallon delivered to the playa was $2.50 per gallon, that means we need $7.50 per minute or $450 per hour to fire her up.

<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 30px;""><strong>FAQ ?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;""><strong>Who can join Mayaida?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone can join mayaida.com, but for artists there is a review process. The process starts after the artist creates a portfolio at mayaida.com; the resultant portfolio will be subject to review and approval by one of our existing members or admins. The same rule is applied for any submission by studios or businesses.</p>
<p>If you join Maya iDA as a supporter/fan, there is no need for the review process, however a supporter/fan is unable make portfolios, but rather boards where he/she can pin their favorite artists and art, as well as supporting cause arts.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;""><strong>Can i join mayaida.com with my facebook or twitter account ?</strong></p>
<p>YES, and if you wish to disconnect your account from Facebook or Twitter you can at anytime.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;""><strong>Who can submit artworks for The Art Book or Project ?</strong></p>
<p>In order to submit artworks for an Art Book or Project, you need to first collaborate with the same Art Book or Project. You can start submitting art works once you selected as a successful collaborator. You cannot collaborate for more than 3 projects.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;""><strong>Who is the jury for the Art Books ?</strong></p>
<p>For specific art books the jury will consist of specific industry masters and experts from different parts of the art and digital art world.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;""><strong>Who can start a Cause Art ?</strong></p>
<p>AnyOne.</p>
<p><strong>What do you mean by 'Profit Share' ?</strong></p>
<p>When one or more art projects becomes a ""Production,"" it means that Maya iDA is planning to publish/distribute the Production for money. A resulting project could be realized as an art book, educational book or short film! Once produced, MayaiDA.com splits the money it makes on the monetization of Productions 50-50 with the Contributing Artists whose art works and materials are included within the Production.</p>
<p>Example: If MayaiDA.com manages to turn a project into a money-making production, such as an Coffee Table Art Book. Fifty percent of the Profits would go to Maya iDA, our official business entity, which maintains the Site, funds future projects, and pays a small team of professionals whose job it is to design, produce, and direct Maya iDA Productions. The remaining fifty percent of Profits goes to all the Contributing Artists whose art works are used within the Production. The writer, artist, the editors, everybody who had a hand in creating the final publication or short film gets a share of the Profits based on how much their contributions were valued (See below).</p>
<p><strong>How is the Contributing Artists' Profit Pool' split up ?</strong></p>
<p>It all depends on your contribution to the projects as well the score factor which means how you engage at MayaiDA.com, the score comes from the likes of your posts, gallery, and reviewing new artist as well participation in art projects. At the end of the day, MayaiDA.com will make the final allocation decisions because someone has to have final sign off, but our decisions will be informed by and based upon community feedback as well.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;""><strong>Are the example book cover and book pages subject to change?</strong></p>
<p>Yup.</p>

Our First Art Book - 2050:REBIRTH
2050:REBIRTH - Art Book

A view of a possible future, topics and themes explored will include - Quantum Physics, Nano bots, Parallel Universe, Beyond Black Holes, Spaceships, Advanced Human Entertainment, Advance Fashion Designs, Major Changes in Human Culture, Alien & Human Collaboration, Advance Communication & Languages, Artificial Intelligence, Singularity, Augmented Reality, Bio-Mechanics and Robots For Daily Life.
Although present in our lives today, 2050 will extrapolate on nascent and emerging technology, providing the blueprint for the future. By 2050, many of our natural instincts and activities, as well as our technology and lifestyle, will have changed. For example, Will men still need women to fulfill their fantasies? Will the natural reproduction of children have altered altogether? Will women still need men for fertilization? Perhaps a bio-mech alternative may take their place.
Imagine the food and entertainment of the future. .. What species will exist in 2050. What path will humanity take? Genetic mutation will certainly be a reality, but will it be a perversion of nature and science or part of evolution.  Within this new world what kind of new species will be born and how does the climate affect their development. What will the effects be on our society? Have robots taken control of our security systems and become our national guard? Will men be needed at all?
Maybe the future will become too much for men to handle, perhaps the changes that will most
certainly occur will be too much for us. What effect would that have on our society?
Imagine if Earth gave up its struggle against mankind and fought back? Would humanity be forced to find a new home? What possible planets will there be? If there was to be an Exodus in 2050 what form would it take? Would the focus be on discovering and developing new technology or the pursuit of a more spiritual path?
What will we be of value in the Year 2050?

FAQ ?
Who can join Mayaida?
Anyone can join mayaida.com, but for artists there is a review process. The process starts after the artist creates a portfolio at mayaida.com; the resultant portfolio will be subject to review and approval by one of our existing members or admins. The same rule is applied for any submission by studios or businesses.
If you join Maya iDA as a supporter/fan, there is no need for the review process, however a supporter/fan is unable make portfolios, but rather boards where he/she can pin their favorite artists and art, as well as supporting cause arts.
Can i join mayaida.com with my facebook or twitter account ?
YES, and if you wish to disconnect your account from Facebook or Twitter you can at anytime.
Who can submit artworks for The Art Book or Project ?
In order to submit artworks for an Art Book or Project, you need to first collaborate with the same Art Book or Project. You can start submitting art works once you selected as a successful collaborator. You cannot collaborate for more than 3 projects.
Who is the jury for the Art Books ?
For specific art books the jury will consist of specific industry masters and experts from different parts of the art and digital art world.
Who can start a Cause Art ?
AnyOne.
What do you mean by 'Profit Share' ?
When one or more art projects becomes a ""Production,"" it means that Maya iDA is planning to publish/distribute the Production for money. A resulting project could be realized as an art book, educational book or short film! Once produced, MayaiDA.com splits the money it makes on the monetization of Productions 50-50 with the Contributing Artists whose art works and materials are included within the Production.
Example: If MayaiDA.com manages to turn a project into a money-making production, such as an Coffee Table Art Book. Fifty percent of the Profits would go to Maya iDA, our official business entity, which maintains the Site, funds future projects, and pays a small team of professionals whose job it is to design, produce, and direct Maya iDA Productions. The remaining fifty percent of Profits goes to all the Contributing Artists whose art works are used within the Production. The writer, artist, the editors, everybody who had a hand in creating the final publication or short film gets a share of the Profits based on how much their contributions were valued (See below).
How is the Contributing Artists' Profit Pool' split up ?
It all depends on your contribution to the projects as well the score factor which means how you engage at MayaiDA.com, the score comes from the likes of your posts, gallery, and reviewing new artist as well participation in art projects. At the end of the day, MayaiDA.com will make the final allocation decisions because someone has to have final sign off, but our decisions will be informed by and based upon community feedback as well.
Are the example book cover and book pages subject to change?
Yup.

<p>I am currently a private tutor who teaches mainly Maths and English, visiting students in their own homes.  However, the reason that I would like to set up this business is that unfortunately my health has deteriorated over the last few years, due to a neurological disorder that causes me to lose my sight, hearing, causes severe nausea and can leave me at times completely paralysed and not to mention the pain and blinding headaches that comes with each attack.</p>
<p>Although I have tried a multitude of treatments and have seen 28 specialists in the last 3 years, they still haven’t been able to get these attacks under control.  However, I remain ever hopeful that I will soon get to the bottom of it.  But in the mean time, as my condition is so debilitating it means that I cannot always go out to work and continue with my tutoring business as normal.  So to find an alternative source of income I started making my own artwork by upcycling antique and vintage dictionary pages and printing vintage images onto them to create unique and beautiful prints suitable for any room in a house.  With the dawn of the e-book and its increasing popularity, I also take unwanted copies of contemporary books such as ‘Alice in Wonderland’ and ‘Harry Potter’ and put matching images on them to give them new life, as pieces of art.  </p>
<p>I would hopefully like to be able to continue to grow my business by making it completely internet based; selling through a variety of websites and also by setting up my own website so that if I am physically unable to go out to work I can still earn a living by doing something that I absolutely love and am passionate about.  This requires taking more time out of my regular day-to-day work to be able to put in the time and effort required to build this business up to full strength, obviously this means that I will be earning a lot less – so your donations will definitely help in buying more equipment and supporting the build up of this business and making it a success.</p>

<br/><div>
<div>Have our backs and we'll put a t-shirt on yours! Simply put: Public Functionary's fall season is quickly approaching, and to make it happen we need your support. As an organization, we strive to present contemporary art experiences that are attainable to all, and with this fundraising campaign we're using the same approach. In lieu of focusing on large donations (though we'll certainly take those too!), we're asking our community to contribute small, feasible amounts that won't break the bank. In exchange, you'll score some choice Public Functionary swag, so you can rep in style wherever you go. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Since our Kickstarter campaign in 2012, we've been hard at work keeping the doors to our space open and accessible to the community. That accessibility has resulted in a pretty magical thing: a revolving door of ambitious experimenters and creative producers with grand ideas -- all of whom consider Public Functionary home. In the spirit of collaboration and big ideas that extend outside of our walls, we've asked 5 organizations in the PF family to contribute custom t-shirt designs using our logo in some way, shape or form. And just like we share our space, we share the love -- $5 of every t-shirt sale will go back to the independent creative business that designed it, further building investment in our community. </div>
<div>
<b>NOTE: </b>In the spirit of community engagement, there will be no local shipping -- we request you come to Public Functionary during an opening or regular gallery hours on or after October 3rd to pick up your t-shirt! </div>

<b>Kevin O'Meara x Public Functionary: The Photo Shoot </b></span>
</div>
<div><span>We asked photographer Kevin O'Meara to apply his signature, visceral street style to a photo shoot featuring some of our favorite friends, staffers and cohorts wearing PF tees.

True to form, Kevin delivered, capturing candid interactions, hilariously awkward moments, amazing energy AND some pretty snazzy PF t-shirts. </span></div>

Have our backs and we'll put a t-shirt on yours! Simply put: Public Functionary's fall season is quickly approaching, and to make it happen we need your support. As an organization, we strive to present contemporary art experiences that are attainable to all, and with this fundraising campaign we're using the same approach. In lieu of focusing on large donations (though we'll certainly take those too!), we're asking our community to contribute small, feasible amounts that won't break the bank. In exchange, you'll score some choice Public Functionary swag, so you can rep in style wherever you go. 

Since our Kickstarter campaign in 2012, we've been hard at work keeping the doors to our space open and accessible to the community. That accessibility has resulted in a pretty magical thing: a revolving door of ambitious experimenters and creative producers with grand ideas -- all of whom consider Public Functionary home. In the spirit of collaboration and big ideas that extend outside of our walls, we've asked 5 organizations in the PF family to contribute custom t-shirt designs using our logo in some way, shape or form. And just like we share our space, we share the love -- $5 of every t-shirt sale will go back to the independent creative business that designed it, further building investment in our community. 

NOTE: In the spirit of community engagement, there will be no local shipping -- we request you come to Public Functionary during an opening or regular gallery hours on or after October 3rd to pick up your t-shirt! 

HOTROCITY x Public Functionary
Fashion and lifestyle brand HOTROCITY has collaborated with PF on a number of events and performances. They support and promote independent makers and designers through their uber-chic online shop and create eclectic experiences that range from dance performances to epic parties to pop up shops. $5 from each HOTROCITY x PF t-shirt sold will go back to them so they can continue making stylish magic! 




BRLSQ x Public Functionary 
Longtime PF besties and screen print crew extraordinare Burlesque of North America have been an institution in the Twin Cities and beyond for years. From founding the famed Life Sucks Die magazine to designing official posters for top indie bands to running award-winning gallery CO Exhibitions, the BRLSQ boys are some of the hardest working kids in the art game. $5 from each BRLSQ x PF t-shirt sold will go back to their organization. 



Greenroom Magazine x Public Functionary 


Some of the most memorable events at PF have been collaborations with our BFFs at Greenroom Magazine, a lifestyle brand and bi-annual publication. Known for their deep community roots and party-throwing proficiency, the Greenroom crew curates impactful, energetic events with majorly positive vibes and celebrates culture, wellness and artists in their beautifully designed print mag. $5 from each Greenroom x PF t-shirt sold will be donated back to them so they can continue to kill it!




MajiMani X Public Functionary

Talented brothers Jendayi and Amani are the heart and soul behind local art and fashion brand MajiMani. Their mission? To create visual arts products with the power to voice inspirational stories. From throwing down live art at PF to collaborating with other organizations and causes to bring awareness to social issues, MajiMani aims to make powerful statements through art. $5 from each MajiMani x PF t-shirt sold will be reinvested into their organization. 



Anthem Heart x Public Functionary Mini Logo Tee

A supporter and friend for years, Ken Hannigan of Anthem Heart is a born collaborator if we've ever known one. From screen printing to graphic design to dynamic event production, Anthem Heart has most definitely served major coolness to the Twin Cities over the years. In fact, Ken's the one hand-printing all of the t-shirts for this campaign! $5 from each Anthem Heart x PF t-shirt sold will be given back so Anthem Heart can make more awesome stuff!







Classic Public Functionary T-shirt
The  PF classic tee displays our iconic logo in large-scale, front and center like a boss. Created with a discharge technique reminiscent of a bleach imprint, each shirt is one-of-a-kind, with varying levels of splatter and bleed. All proceeds from the classic tee go directly to Public Functionary so we can keep bringing awesome art experiences to the community.




Kevin O'Meara x Public Functionary: The Photo Shoot 

We asked photographer Kevin O'Meara to apply his signature, visceral street style to a photo shoot featuring some of our favorite friends, staffers and cohorts wearing PF tees. In lieu of a polished fashion editorial approach, we chose Kevin specifically because we knew he'd bring the contemporary art realness -- work we'd be proud to show on our gallery walls.

virtually everywhere and have them present their work in one of our categories
to sell it.  These  categories can be seen in the sections on line

</h3></div></div>","Our Story
 
 I am asking you to help artists
everywhere create more work.  
 
I am Joseph Kinnebrew (http://www.josephkinnebrew.com).  I created an idea
that would offer a variety of options to serve artists and others who were
passionate about art.
 
I am very committed to helping
others and for 2 years have personally financed the building of this
idea.  It is AcquisitionArt.com.  It is about artists flourishing
by using their special form of creativity and while much of this starts and
depends upon selling their work I can assure you after 45 years of surviving as
an artist it is about a lot more than just selling work.
 
We are much more than an on line
gallery.  The idea of
AcquisitionArt.com is evolving into a multilayered web based service business.
 We are still in the early stages but our idea is functional(ing) and has been in beta test since February.  There are
many things we would like to share with you. 
When you visit the site you can read more about how we pursue our unique
mission.  This goes far beyond the usual
approach to selling art.  This is an artist's idea about what artists need to work
effectively.
 
The cornerstone of our idea is that it is uncommonly personal and very flexible. When offering art for sale we
create a one on one conversation between the owner of the art and an interested
buyer. When artists tell their story they are far more apt to sell their work.  I
started with what I know to be true from years of experience.  Stories
create provenance.  Provenance instills pride of ownership and that builds
collections.
 
We want to reach out everywhere
the Internet does.  Yes, we want to converse with the world and yes we
believe this is a 3rd new way to sell art. 
 
We have devoted months of
research to the many things we can offer to help artists survive by reflecting
their highly individual needs.   We also include others who simply own art
and want to sell it.  On our functioning prototype website (new design coming soon) you can read
about many of these services and we are deeply involved in developing others,
particularly in the areas of higher education, webcasts with information on
demand, logistical support and corporate sponsorship.
 
It is just all this important
because history teaches us that:          
 
With no art there will be no
memory of us.
 
The Impact
We are past the idea stage with
a small team and have over 25 prototype artist participants, 7 distinguished advisory
professionals (you can read about them on line) and 3 art advisors.  We have been live on the web testing
our idea since February.

This is an evolving project and
like many it moves in fits and starts as we gain expertise, insight, funding
and develop new partnerships and relationships.  It is well known that getting artists to act on their own behalf is difficult.  We have many aspects of AqA to fund in the months ahead but specifically at this
stage and in this project we are seeking funding to reach out to artists
virtually everywhere and have them present their work in one of our categories
to sell it.  These  categories can be seen in the sections on line
which are currently limited to ""The Collection"" and The
MarketPlace"" but more have been programed such as photography, prints, student work  and ceramics.  They are ready as soon as we have
listings.  Our initial goal is to have 2500 works of art and fine crafts
offered for sale.  Before we can invite
(actively solicit) buyers we must have a sufficient number of art objects for
them to look at, or in other words, have and exciting collection!

We have concluded from the
initial prototype that in this next stage, offering an incentive to existing
sellers to bring other sellers to the project, is a realistic and accelerated
way to grow.  The object of having many new works is to create sales which
establishes credibility and creates it's own momentum.

There are many aspects of
survival that we will address, but we believe that selling work is the most
important place to start.  Once we can
point to sales many other things will follow.
 
What We Need & What You Get
 
We are seeking $7,500 for a
reward program.   We will use any and all of these funds to administer and
offer $2.50 to a current project participant for every accepted
listed item by a new artist they bring to AcquisitionArt.com.  This will
help us ""stock our shelves with inventory"" (listed items are listed
for 6 months at no charge).

I feel the time has come to reach
out to others for funding.  To date I have funded this project
personally. This includes site design (which needs to be redone), programing, web site, administrative, office, salary and
marketing expenses.  I have done this for nearly 2 years because I
think it is important.

All of us here know how to say
thanks and share.

For all our benefactors pledging
over $25 we waive the 15% admin fee for purchases (see below) and say thank you.
 We also offer gifts for various levels of contribution... thank you.

I am and we are volunteers with a
passion and know the most important thing you get is more art in your life and
that of others.  That is our mission and you can join us.  In this
economy and in these times of turbulent change artists have traditionally brought
forth the gifts of insight into things up close and far away.  We need
more art and we should not have to subject it to only the uncertainly of generosity
and  charity.

We are anxious to tell you more
about our vision and what we have done.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 
AcquisitionArt is not a charity
or non-profit. We act and operate as a business that looks to the future.
 I know from years of personal experience the art business needs
affordable, easily accessible and centralized services.   To date we cannot
find such encompassing and often critical services elsewhere. 
There are many projects for us to
undertake and we hope you will want to hear more from us about these as we get
to know each other.  This is a wonderful and eminently worthy journey.
 We want to bring greater dignity and opportunity to artists.  We
hope that fewer of them won't have to have second and third jobs that they use
to support a few stolen moments in the studio to share and create works for
everyone.
On the web site http://www.acquisitionart.com there is an
important menu item referring to partnerships.  Please read this as it can
be very useful to various cultural institutions, which you may have an interest
in.  We believe by sharing there will be more art.

ideas and suggestions... we can all share in many ways",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>But as we grew up, many of those dreams faded. Some of those dreams held on though, and are still with us aren’t they?</p>
<p>So what are you doing about them?

<p>My show and artwork focuses on finding beauty in everyday objects and being grateful for the beauty around us.</p>
<p><em>""Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it"" - Confucius</em></p>
<p>Do we perceive beauty in a commonplace? We have developed a culture in which, through familiarity, we take for granted the value and beauty of life's most basic and fundamental offerings. There is truly beauty in the commonplace, for those that dare take the time to observe and appreciate it.</p>
<p><em>""Do not blame the thistle that you see no beauty"" -  Johnathan Lockwood Huie</em></p>
<p>I'm intrigued by what is – but rarely noticed. By remaining highly sensitive to the subtleties of light and shadow, I create intimate reflections of everyday life, objects and people. Finding beauty in the common place is important to me as a form of reflection, appreciation and gratitude... And that in itself... gratitude is one of life's greatest healers. </p>
<p>When I’m painting, each piece of artwork goes through numerous stages as it is built up in layers. Each layer has a different purpose and presents new challenges and struggles. At these stages I constantly remind myself not to feel defeated or give up. Instead, I press on through the difficulty to reveal the end product, a beautiful painting that would not have come to be without the underlying struggle. The process is interestingly reflective of life’s journeys.</p>
<p>They often say, “When you look outside, you dream. When you look within, you awaken”. My art is a voice motivating you and me to do both. </p>

<p>I’m back with another dream project: a graphic novella about driving across Canada and thinking about life. Several years ago, with the help of many funders, I was able to make a book of watercolours, and it has honestly been the highlight of my career. But it got me thinking about a lot of other ideas and other ways to tell a story. And a graphic novella seems like a logical next step. And as these things seem to go, a perfect storm is brewing. In October, I am doing a three week residency in northern B.C at Cassiar Cannery near Prince Rupert. It’s the perfect opportunity to start a new project. I am planning to drive there, all the while making drawings and notes of my misadventures, of sights and sounds, and of thoughts and small epiphanies, while also recording tips and suggestions for staying sober (fingers crossed) while on such a long, lonely journey. I’ll then use my time at the residency to put it all together: a lyrical road of tangents connected one to the next across the country. If it sounds a little ambitious, just remember, it’s only a novella and anything is possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And of course I have some fun perks. The graphic novella/comic book of course. But also a digital drawing profile pic, a watercolour profile pic, and even a larger commission for the truly brave at heart. I haven’t quite cracked the code yet for how to survive as an artist, but at least I’m having fun making the truest work of my life as I figure it out, and I am truly grateful to all who have helped on the way.

<p><strong>Hi, I’m Kate. </strong></p>
<p>I’m an artist living in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
<p>I’ve been enamored with the beauty around me since I was a little girl growing up in Manistee, Michigan and have spent a lot of my life since then working to translate that beauty into art.</p>
<p>In college, I studied in both the Two-Dimensional and Three-Dimensional programs at the Visual Arts Center in Portsmouth, VA  which means I was able to practice not just drawing and painting but glass-blowing, pottery, and sculpture. I loved every minute of it. </p>
<p>I’ve been lucky enough to work out of my home studio and offer my art at festivals, online, and at shows for the past 8 years.</p>
<p>I’ve become known for my watercolor on canvas pieces,  mostly abstracted landscapes, florals, and deconstructions, all working to capture and convey that same beauty-feeling.</p>
<p>Lately though, I’ve been feeling the pull to do something more as an artist.  </p>
<p>I’m still enamored with the beauty around us, but I’ve become more and more enchanted by the beauty that’s inside of us too. </p>
<p>I’ve been leading a lot of workshops and classes for adults this past year, and what I keep seeing is that many of us are so caught-up in our daily stress that we’ve let that child-like, free, beautiful part in us get drowned out by everything else. </p>
<p>Helping people reconnect with and explore that part of themselves is beautiful on its own, I’ve loved doing it and want to do it more.</p>
<p>And I feel like my next step as an artist is to really lean into that, to help people bridge that gap between the beauty inside them and the beauty in the outside world, because when that happens, when people give themselves permission to see it more often, and to feel it more deeply - that beauty gets multiplied exponentially. </p>
<p>But I don’t have a space to do that consistently, so I just kept painting in my back room and dreaming</p>
<p>Then I got a call about a space…</p>
<p>It’s not huge, but it’s big enough; and it’s in the perfect location, right on the corner of Colley and 44th. </p>
<p>And it will allow me  to start doing the types of things I’ve been dreaming of…</p>
<p>Things like:</p>
<p>Open Studio Nights - A night to hang art all over and invite the community to come soak it in. </p>
<p>Workshops - Where we can really focus on being loose and tapping into that part of ourselves that we don’t get to see very much. </p>
<p>Collaborations- The chance to work with other artists who want to bring more beauty to the world too. </p>
<p>Plus we’ll be able to do lots of other fun stuff like Kids Classes, Healing Art Nights, Girls Night Out, Dinners With The Artist…</p>
<p>A place to bring the healing power of community, creativity, and art to this part of Norfolk in a real way that’s accessible for everyone. </p>
<p>It will also be a space that allows me to paint bigger. Painting big is always something I'm itching to do.</p>
<p>My head is spinning with ideas, I’m so excited to share more with you once we get it up and running. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the thing, I did not go out looking for this space, it sprung up on me, and I can’t make it happen on my own. </p>
<p>I need help getting these beauty-multipliers out into the world. </p>
<p>Will you consider joining me in that?</p>
<p>The goal for this campaign is $8,000. </p>
<p>Almost all of that will go directly to cover the rent, but some of it will go toward things I’ll need for the space like a sign, a couple of tables for workshops, and some chairs, insurance, signage and things like that. </p>
<p>For helping me bring this dream to reality, you’ll be able to choose from some really fun perks at lots of different levels. </p>
<p>I have everything from packs of notecards with my art on them, to studio dinners, tours of the Chrysler, painting lessons, in-home art consultations and lots of others at every level. </p>
<p>I even made an Indiegogo-only painting and prints you can only get here during the campaign. </p>
<p>If I don’t get the full amount, that’s ok, all the funds will still go towards making this space a reality. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>To be honest with you, I’m excited but I’m nervous too!</p>
<p>The cliche of the “starving artist” exists for a reason. I’ve been very lucky to be able to have been a full-time artist for the past 8 years, but this is a stretch for me. </p>
<p>Signing a lease with a rent bill every month is a big commitment. </p>
<p>But I’m passionate about bringing this kind of art and these kinds of connections to Norfolk, and this space is so perfect for all of it, I feel like I have to go for it. </p>
<p>I’m all-in and I’m going to do everything I can to make it work. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Any help you are able to offer really does mean a lot to me. </p>
<p>If you can pitch in and pick out some perks, great! If you can’t pitch-in right now, that’s completely fine too! </p>
<p>There are other ways to help out if money is tight right now. </p>
<p>Please help me spread the word on social media, send the link to your auntie, your BFF, and your neighbors. Tell your HR department I do awesome corporate workshops… Help me get the word out! </p>
<p>Indiegogo has some great built-in share tools, look for the share button and post it on your social media, it really is helpful, the more people that see it the better, and sometimes it takes a few nudges for people to remember that they wanted to do it :)</p>
<p>(I am going to check through the shares a couple times during the campaign and pick a couple to give a gift so get in on that too!)</p>
<p>Thanks so much for checking out my campaign and for reading all of this. </p>
<p>I really do appreciate you, and feel so lucky to have all the support I do. </p>

Parallèlement elle pratique la danse et expérimente diverses approches dans le mouvement. Le Buto, le contact improvisation, le flamenco et le tango argentin contribuent à la construction du langage qu’elle développe au gré de son inspiration. Christine travaille également au sein du Papillon blanc, danse; un organisme qui intervient auprès des personnes en perte d'autonomie.Passionnée de nature, cette dernière nourrit une grande partie de la production photographique qu’elle expose dans des organismes ou galeries de la région de Québec.​ Julia-Maude Cloutier (danse)Julia-Maude est interprète et chorégraphe en danse contemporaine. Elle pratique en parallèle des arts physiques tels la capoeira et l'art du déplacement (parkour). Sa recherche est ancrée dans le mouvement, ce que le corps athlète a comme possibilité créative. Au centre de ses préoccupations : l'être humain et les relations entre individus. Pour ce faire, elle préconise le travail in situ et multidisciplinaire. Maryse Damecour (danse, participation bénévole)Après des études en sociologie (université), Maryse complète le programme de l’École de danse de Québec. Depuis 2009, elle œuvre en danse, performance, musique et théâtre auprès d’artistes tels que Daniel Bélanger, Hanna Ab Del Nour, Laurence Brunelle-Côté et Kira Kirsch. Maryse poursuit la sincérité dans la danse. Elle cherche un geste complet, qui est sous tendu par une émotion, un état corporel, un regard, une attention, une intention, un désir. Elle appelle une danse motivée par les mouvements intérieurs et profonds tout en conscientisant la forme matériel du corps. Sa motivation artistique est la communication et la transmission. Alliant la danse, la performance, les arts visuels, la musique et la parole, Maryse adresse des thématiques sociales et humaines et vise à participer à la réflexion collective autant sociétale qu’artistique. Stéphanie Gaudreau (danse)Photo : Charles Bélisle - @belisle.proThérapeute par le mouvement, danseuse, pédagogue et femme de la terre, depuis 1996 elle dédie sa vie professionnelle à l’Être humain.Engagé activement depuis 1992 dans la communauté de Contact Improvisation, fondatrice de l’ACI à Montréal et de « Danse Orée des bois » situé dans la pleine nature de l’Estrie. Marie-Noëlle Goy (danse)Après des études professionnelles en danse contemporaine et classique en France, Marie-Noëlle Goy soucieuse d'approfondir sa démarche artistique s’est également formée à l’animation culturelle, au théâtre, à la création et l’animation de projets artistiques et culturels. En 1994, elle va s'investir dans la fondation du centre culturel et artistique le Café des Arts de Québec.Danseuse, comédienne et metteure en scène, tour à tour, c'est la passion pour l'être humain vulnérable et fragilisé par la maladie qui va la pousser à plonger dans un projet novateur de danse à l’hôpital en cofondant Le Papillon blanc, danse (OBNL) en 2013.Sa démarche est soutenue par un élan intérieur de beauté, de vérité et de vitalité qui articule sa danse et sa présence vers l'harmonie et le bien-être. Elle crée ainsi des visites dansées et des médiations culturelles dans les CHSLD, CRDI, Hôpitaux et centres de cancérologie du Québec. ​Andrée Levesque-Sioui (chant)Andrée est Wendat de la communauté de Wendake près de Québec, sa ville natale. Auteure mélodiste interprète, elle affectionne particulièrement les possibilités qu’offrent l’improvisation et les jeux rythmiques de sa tradition orale. La voix devient, cet instrument de quête d’oralité enfouie, l’éveil d’une mémoire par le chant, la langue et les tambours. Au-delà du style musical, c’est l’authenticité de la démarche humaine au cœur de l’expérience vocale qui l’interpelle. Chaque style lui permet d’explorer certains aspects de sa personnalité et l’ouvre à de nouveaux espaces.En suivant diverses formations, elle a exploré le chant classique et gospel, le yoga du son, le chant choral, Estill voice training et le théâtre. Innucadie 2017, Gala prix du gouverneur général 2017, Ensemble nous sommes Québec, Kiugwe, Jeux para-panaméricains 2015, WendaKébec, Bruits du monde, Kwahiatonhk, murmures et torrents de la grande tortue, Les 4 directions, Libérons les voix etc. Elle est l’interprète principale de trois albums: Yahndawa’ (2011), (meilleure réalisation d’album aux Native American Music Awards 2013 et meilleure musique du monde aux Eworld Music Award 2012); Fais dodo mon trésor (2012) et Ozalik (2013). Elle a chanté sur la chaîne APTN pour l’émission TAM. Engagée dans sa communauté, elle y enseigne la langue wendat auprès des jeunes et des adultes depuis 2010.   Jean Désy (poésie)Jean est né au Saguenay. Il enseigne à l’Université Laval à Québec, en médecine et en littérature. Il pratique toujours la médecine en tant que dépanneur dans le pays cri de la Baie-James et au Nunavik. Parmi ses dernières parutions, un recueil de récits d’inspiration médicale intitulé L’accoucheur en cuissardes, publié aux éditons XYZ en avril 2015; un recueil de poésie en collaboration avec Normand Génois et intitulé Bras-du-Nord, en septembre 2015, aux éditions Mémoire d’encrier; un court essai sur le métissage et la métisserie, paru en septembre 2016 chez Mémoire d’encrier, intitulé Amériquoisie; un essai portant sur la spiritualité, paru en mars 2017 chez XYZ éditeur, en collaboration avec Isabelle Duval André Beaudoin (vidéo drone)André est passionné de nature, de musique et de photographie depuis toujours. En particulier, il a une solide formation en piano classique acquise à l'École Vincent d'Indy de Montréal et il a décroché quelques prix dans des concours provinciaux et nationaux. Il a une formation autodidacte en photographie. Malgré qu'il mène une carrière scientifique portant sur la santé des forêts, il réalise divers projets artistiques multidisciplinaires célébrant la beauté de la nature.Ceux-ci intègrent ses interprétations au piano et sa photographie.

<h3>NEW INCENTIVES FOR JANUARY!</h3>
<p>Hello all! I've decided to sweeten my deal by doing some non-caricature work exclusively available for the duration of this campaign.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/foit1y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The first print is the print of my octopus ladies, or Cecaelia. Because few things say ""I'm an artist"" like combining tasteful nudity with tentacles.</p>
<p>If the above image looks a little squished, try right clicking and opening it in a new tab or window. I assure you the print is not squished.</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/j5w7xu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>The second print I'm offering is a popular work I did featuring a clash of a number of popular video game characters.</p>
<h3> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/9iyfdl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The last print is a promotional poster for one of the webcomics I'm writing, and the one I have the story the most developed for. Its called The Marvelous Metahumans of Metroit, and actually started out as a D&amp;D-styles game with some of my buddies. This comic was born from some of our game sessions and story ideas, with my personal twist on story telling (which involves including ""everything awesome"" and making it work.) I'm super excited to get started drawing the issues of this comic, and I'm hoping it'll be on a brand new Cintiq!</p>
<p>Thank you all for all your continued support. I have never felt quit as loved and awesome as I have this last month.</p>

<h3>Who is this kid?</h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to my little fund raiser. My name is Jared Stokes and I've spent the last three years cutting my teeth as a caricature artist at Busch Gardens. In that time I've developed a pretty unique style which I call ""getting Stoked!""</p>
<p>However, I've hit a bit of a snag in the road. Normally, the money I make doing caricatures is fine. It's nothing to retire on, but it gets me through. However, this last summer the weather was terrible, which affected our sales, our hours, and our pay. I blew through $3,000 I had in savings to make rent and pay my student loan bills, and business at the park just never picked back up. I had to move back in with my parents - where I'm very grateful - but I share a tiny bedroom with my girlfriend and next to zero space to work on artwork. I've been searching for another job with no success and morale is running out.</p>
<p><br/>Which is where this comes in. If I'm ever going to take a career risk this is the time to do it - when I'm living with my parents and have very little to lose. I want to get established in the realm of digital art. I've written two webcomics and thought of tons of clever t-shirt designs and have gotten increasing interest in my freelancing capabilities - and I need a suitable piece of equipment to work on.  My Wacom tablet and laptop are starting to show their age. I want a Cintiq.</p>
<p><br/>I'm offering caricatures to raise the money. I have developed a very unique style over the years and really enjoy seeing where my craft is developing. I'm getting petty stoked about this project and I hope you'll get Stoked, too!</p>
</div>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
Good feelings and cool art of you, your friend, your kids, your dogs, whoever you think needs a good Stoking.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you give me just 1$ you'll have my eternal and sincerest thanks.</div>

You will be helping me upgrade my current and aging technology and prepare myself for the jump into the digital art world. You will be helping to put more art into the world and that has never, ever been a bad idea.</p>

That's okay! So am I!<br/>But you can still help out. Tell a friend, no, tell seven friends, your family, write it on a bathroom stall, tweet it, tumbl it and put it on facebook. Spreading the word can help me out just as much as a monetary contribution!</div>

<h3><strong>Why a Rocket Sleigh?<br/></strong></h3>
<p>Everyone loves getting gifts! Everyone loves Holiday cheer! Everyone loves Santa! The Merry Marauder will be an ideal base for interactive mischief and gifting. Planned playa gifts include ice deliveries, deep playa art tours, ice cold towels, the Santafication of others, and much general jolly mayhem!</p>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>You know why you never hear much about East Coast mutant vehicles? Because they are a pain in the ass! It’s a ton of work to modify an old beat up vehicle into something beautiful. You need somewhere to build it, a way to transport it across country and back, and somewhere to store it when your're done. All of this is very expensive in terms of time, tools, and money.</p>
<h3>So why build an art car?</h3>
<p>The truth is, there is no good reason. It's art! We are doing it for it’s own sake – because it’s fun! The team building the Merry Marauder has been attending Burning Man since 1998, and running Santarchy in Washington DC since 2001. Building the Merry Marauder is something we’ve never done before – a whole new set of challenges to overcome and problems to solve. We have artists from San Fran working on the design, from Raleigh building the reindeer, from Philly building the sleigh runners, and a crew of gear heads in DC keeping the car running and doing all the assembly.</p>
<div>
<h3>Where is the money going?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fabrication: Piles of new wood, stainless steel sleigh runners, and many repurposed vintage parts.</li>
<li>Sound: Santa's sleigh will be powered by stereo rocket pods playing your favorite holiday tunes.</li>
<li>Rudolph: Our steampunk reindeer will pack a 500w halogen search light nose (photos soon!).</li>
<li>Color changing LED Lighting</li>
<li>Power: The Merry Marauder is a 48v electric vehicle. Harnessing the batteries to run all these lights and toys requires some tricky engineering.</li>
<li>Upholstery: The Marauder will be a comfy ride for all guest Santas.</li>
<li>Transport: Washington DC to Black Rock City NV, and back.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Planned playa gifts include ice deliveries, deep playa art tours, ice cold towels, the Santafication of others, and much general jolly mayhem!
Why We Need Your Help
You know why you never hear much about East Coast mutant vehicles? Because they are a pain in the ass! It’s a ton of work to modify an old beat up vehicle into something beautiful. You need somewhere to build it, a way to transport it across country and back, and somewhere to store it when your're done. All of this is very expensive in terms of time, tools, and money.
So why build an art car?
The truth is, there is no good reason. It's art! We are doing it for it’s own sake – because it’s fun! The team building the Merry Marauder has been attending Burning Man since 1998, and running Santarchy in Washington DC since 2001. Building the Merry Marauder is something we’ve never done before – a whole new set of challenges to overcome and problems to solve. We have artists from San Fran working on the design, from Raleigh building the reindeer, from Philly building the sleigh runners, and a crew of gear heads in DC keeping the car running and doing all the assembly.

Where is the money going?

Fabrication: Piles of new wood, stainless steel sleigh runners, and many repurposed vintage parts.
Sound: Santa's sleigh will be powered by stereo rocket pods playing your favorite holiday tunes.
Rudolph: Our steampunk reindeer will pack a 500w halogen search light nose (photos soon!).
Color changing LED Lighting
Power: The Merry Marauder is a 48v electric vehicle. Harnessing the batteries to run all these lights and toys requires some tricky engineering.
Upholstery: The Marauder will be a comfy ride for all guest Santas.
Transport: Washington DC to Black Rock City NV, and back.

giving away most of the work I create, for little to no profit. I've met some very generous people in my life that have always helped me through tough times, and because of them, I'm a big 
believer in volunteering, giving back to the local community, and maintaining a simple lifestyle. Over the past year, I've had serious discomfort in my abdomen, which has made it very difficult to maintain my simple lifestyle. Besides being more fatigued than usual, I've lost about 80 pounds due to feelings of premature satiety brought on by bloating and discomfort. It's gotten to the point that I'm rarely able to actually eat any of my baked creations. It's not a total loss though, because through baking I am able to donate my creations to shelters.

<p>The <i><b>Plant Encounters</b></i> project is an independently-driven roaming residency that seeks to activate and complicate our relationship with plants and plant’s relationship with us. The project will take many forms over the course of a 3+ month road trip throughout the western U.S. We will be visiting gardens, oceans, artists, homesteads, established residencies, and everywhere/everyone in between. Our travels are an exchange. While encountering the plant environments of various new places we have the opportunity and responsibility to offer views into the plant environments, both tangible and abstract, of our own homelands.  Encounters along the way will take the form of tiny collaborations… with artists, with plants, with everyday people we come across. A thirty-second dance performance with a nasturtium flower on the edge of California. A three hour interview with a life-long farmer. The opportunities are endless. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div><div>One big focus of the project will be conducting video interviews to learn plant stories. We'll do this with people we meet as well as a more abstract form with plants we meet. We'll also complete short photo series, off-the-cuff installations and performances, and fibers pieces. Documentation of these mini-projects will be edited and published into small zines. A book will be published at the end that compiles everything together. Most of the work will be collaborative in form and we'll seek out a variety of artists, gardeners, and others to work with.</div><div><br/></div><div>We're leaving in mid-January and heading south to New Orleans first. We'll then scoot across the SW and spend half a month in Los Angeles. Then it's up the coast to the bay area and to a homestead in Sonoma County where we'll spend the month of March. In April we'll finish our jaunt up the west coast to Vancouver and then the plan is to circle back around for a residency in Iowa (provided we are accepted as residents).

<h3>Perks</h3>
Our perks borrow from our experiences in photography, publishing, fibers, cooking and performance. A few will be delivered pre-project but the majority of them will become integral aspects of the work we create for <b><i>Plant Encounters</i></b>. Our Snapchat updates, handmade postcards, zines, hankies, and photo prints will detail stories of people and plants we encounter along the way. The <i><b>Plant Encounters</b></i> book will combine all these stories into one finished project. Our premium perks offer our face-to-face services as plant-talkers, chefs, and performance planners. We're even giving away our own plants with the ""house plant for you"" perk!

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Plants have always been a large topic of conversation but our society's increasing interest in plant-based diets, local agriculture, and environmentalism has put them at the forefront of today's dialogues. We believe there is something lacking from these conversations. Plants are treated as scientific tools but we lack the empathy to truly relate to them. Plants are tender, living beings and should be viewed as such. The <b><i>Plant Encounters</i></b> project looks to <i>activate</i> our relationship with plants. We want to get down and dirty with plants. We want to hangout with them and talk with them like we would a friend or a lover. We believe this approach more appropriately honors plants for the role they play in our lives. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We're also </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">complicating</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> our relationship with plants. By raising awareness of new ways to relate to plants, we are shifting our view of plants to be a more rich and complex one. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>These two goals of <i>activating</i> and <i>complicating</i> position our work as a new perspective in the conversation of plants and what they mean to us. We believe that what we have to offer can result in a more holistic approach to engaging with plants. And this intimate approach can only lead to a better understanding of how engagement with plants can better ourselves and others. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Given that our project revolves around traveling and interacting with people, there are a lot of risks at play. To us, the biggest risk is asking others to work with us. We will be entering other's spaces and inviting them to participate in our project. <i>What's in it for them?</i> While a good portion of our trip is pre-planned, we intend on visiting places where we know nobody and have no set-in-stone intention. In order to make our exchanges with others more equitable, we view ourselves as a database of plant-based stories and ideas. With each encounter, we listen and we pass the story of that encounter on to others. We have our own stories and we also exist as messengers for the stories of others. We understand this is a huge responsibility and we will strive to treat others and their stories with respect and dignity. We believe this mentality will allow us to have an incredibly enriching series of encounters with all the different people we meet.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The traveling aspect of the trip also lends itself to more straightforward risks. The main precaution we've taken is building $1000 of emergency funding into our budget. This makes up about a quarter of our entire budget and we'll surely need to  delve into it at some point. Aside from cash, Caroline has spent a good portion of her life traveling, including a 3-month road trip a few years ago. She has the experience of how to play it safe while traveling with your entire life in your trunk.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We also recognize that our project seeks to create a huge variety of works instead of focusing on one or two main mediums. As artists, we have purposefully strayed from putting ourselves into the boxes of a chief medium. We believe in the radical potential of experimentation and are consistently working with new mediums. This interdisciplinary approach is built into our artistic practice and, thus, will be a large part of Plant Encounters. Our movement between mediums will manifest in works that subvert norms and traditions and offer up fresh perspectives on plants.</div> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot afford to contribute or simply do not want to, you can still help us by sharing this campaign across your social networks! Pass it along to friends who love plants or simply post about it on Facebook/Twitter/etc.</p>
<p>We'd also love to collaborate with you in some form! Please be in touch if you'd like to meet with us at any point on our journeys.</p>

Drawlie was
created to help people start and improve their drawing skills by making the process friendlier and more accessible.
Our sketchbook combines exercises and guides together with blank pages, so you can practice and draw freehand. Always have it with you and be ready for when creativity strikes!

  Simple & Fun 



Learning to
draw with Drawlie is easy, convenient and stress free. Lessons are designed not
to take up too much time so that you can use every spare moment to sketch something on your own.
Drawlie is
for those who have never drawn anything in their lives, as well as for those who have experience but want
more. 
You will
find different styles and topics in your sketchbook, as various artists prepare different lessons.



















Why drawing?
 



Let's face
it - at some point in your life, the ability to draw would have come in so
handy! 
Drawing is beautiful in addition to being useful; the ability to
transfer your imagination onto paper is irreplaceable.  It helps you express your thoughts, makes you more creative and most of all, brings a lot of fun!








    Who are we?We are Zuzia & Michał - siblings who live in Warsaw, Poland. 


After graduating from business school, Michał worked in an advertising agency where he always wished he had the ability to draw, so
that he could visualize his ideas better. Zuzia is a final-year painting student at
the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. She decided to help Michał learn to sketch by
giving him her own sketchbook for inspiration. The idea to create DRAWLIE
popped out right away!







What do we need money for?

 

We really need your support. We will allocate funds in:


finding more artists to create lessons - we already prepared most of them but we want Drawlie to be as good as possible
starting the production

<a href=""http://www.nervetank.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Nerve Tank</a> is a world-class innovator in theatrical performance. Founded by Melanie S. Armer and Chance Muehleck, the company collaborates with actors and designers in a spirit of artistic adventure and remodels traditional performance methods. We combine elements of popular culture, mediated image, and physical presence to test lines of engagement between spectator and live event.<p></p>
<p></p>Based in New York, we have staged works at chashama, FringeNYC, Dixon Place, University Settlement, Incubator Arts Project, the World Financial Center Winter Garden, and Pittsburgh’s Flux Festival. From 2008 to 2010 we were the resident theatre company of the Brooklyn Lyceum. In 2011, NT was named a Person of the Year by the New York Theatre Experience.<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/9243/files/20130813070159-20110510_9999_77.jpg?1376402519"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</span></span></span><h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p><strong>WHAT ARE WE DOING?</strong></p></span></span></span></h3>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">
<p>Glad you asked! We’re taking a big risk on an ambitious project. Inspired by the myth of Sisyphus, <a href=""http://www.artsbrookfield.com/new_york/grace_building/event_446.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>Glory Road</em></a> is an interactive, outdoor performance featuring a 6 ½ foot metal sphere. As the sphere rotates, it triggers sound fragments via technology housed in its core. The performance will be presented by Arts Brookfield at New York’s Grace Building Plaza September 18 – 21. It’s free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Sisyphus was a daring and clever king who outwitted the gods on numerous occasions. He lied, stole, and murdered for fun and profit. He was also a brilliant navigator and inventor whose knowledge surpassed mortal limits. Zeus, affronted by his insolence, sentenced him to an absurd fate: Overseen by Persephone, Queen of the Underworld, Sisyphus must forever push a boulder up a mountain only to have it roll back down.</p>
<p>We’re using this myth to explore questions of futility, enslavement, and self-realization. Sisyphus’ overreaching exacts a terrible price, but one which he willingly pays. He views his endless torment as a kind of victory in that Zeus was so afflicted by his cunning he assigned Sisyphus a unique punishment, equal in scope and ambition to his mortal offences. The anti-hero relishes his stubborn pride. He’s a superstar of his own making.</p>
<p>As a company, we’re always looking to build work that challenges expectations and speaks directly to our accelerated, media-savvy culture. <em>Glory Road</em> is a project that marries several different worlds: Theatre, dance, contemporary art, large-scale installation, and cutting-edge digital technology. We think it’s the place performance needs to be moving, and we invite you to take the journey with us!<br/></p></span></span></span><h3> <strong>WHERE ARE WE AT?</strong>

<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">
<p>The Nerve Tank has a proven track record of collaborating with designers and technicians in surprising ways and attracting audiences of varied interests and backgrounds. Our interactive installation <a href=""http://youtu.be/mMB9GMptkV8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>The Attendants</em></a> was presented by Arts Brookfield in 2011 to great acclaim; it was viewed worldwide via webcam, and the Village Voice called it “an important new development in performance.”</p>
<p><em>Glory Road</em>’s main attraction, the giant sphere housing a 12-speaker array and specialized technology, is already built. We spent a long and rewarding week at The Wurks in Providence, RI welding, grinding, and bending metal to achieve a remarkable piece of kinetic sculpture. A record-breaking heat wave was no match for our intrepid fabricators.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/9279/files/20130813071154-2013-07-19_13.14.27.jpg?1376403114"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The sphere has just been galvanized and is ready to come to New York and begin rehearsals. Our director, Melanie S. Armer, has been busy choreographing movement for Persephone and her “Minions,” and digital interface wizards Stephan Moore and Mikhail Mansion are programming sound files to respond to the sphere’s position in space as it’s pushed along the Plaza.</p>
<p>Costume designer Miodrag Guberinic is making a collection of beautiful, haunting pieces for our performers to wear, including an elaborate “lava dress” for Persephone (Robin Kurtz) and several jumpsuits embedded with QR codes for our faceless Minions. Video designer Chris Jordan is collaborating with co-founders Chance and Melanie to create content for the CRT screens.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/9306/files/20130813072401-Persephone_Dress_cropped.jpg?1376403841"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></span></span><h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><strong>WHAT DO WE NEED?

<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">
<p>In short, we need $11,000 to offset the costs of producing <em>Glory Road</em> the way it—and our audience—deserve. Arts Brookfield has given us the start we need. Now, we look to you to help us create a truly memorable and groundbreaking experience.</p>
<p>The amount we’re asking for can be broken into three categories: Artist fees, materials, and transport. We believe in paying our performers and designers a competitive wage, so a fair chunk of our fiscal goal will be allocated to them. A significant amount will go to the purchase of large-scale set pieces such as CRT screens* and a hefty amount of red carpet. The remaining dollars will cover transportation expenses (a 600-pound, 6 ½’ steel sphere doesn’t move itself!).</p>
<p><em>Glory Road</em> is free and open to the public. Which means we won’t be making any money with ticket sales. This is as it should be, but it’s imperative that we manage our budget with the resources we have. These resources include you, dear reader. Think of your donation as another kind of ticket to our grand spectacle.</p>
<p>And perks! Ah, the perks. For $25 you’ll get our company-sourced <em>Recipes for Disaster: 13 Dishes to Get You Up and See You Through</em>. For $50, add our all-cotton, super-swank Nerve Tank t-shirt. Want to learn to weld? How about computer coding? Jump up to $500 and receive personal, one-on-one coaching from our company members in a variety of disciplines. And for $1,000 we'll take you behind the scenes with our very special Truth or Dare perk.<br/></p>

The Nerve Tank is a world-class innovator in theatrical performance. Founded by Melanie S. Armer and Chance Muehleck, the company collaborates with actors and designers in a spirit of artistic adventure and remodels traditional performance methods. We combine elements of popular culture, mediated image, and physical presence to test lines of engagement between spectator and live event.
Based in New York, we have staged works at chashama, FringeNYC, Dixon Place, University Settlement, Incubator Arts Project, the World Financial Center Winter Garden, and Pittsburgh’s Flux Festival. From 2008 to 2010 we were the resident theatre company of the Brooklyn Lyceum. In 2011, NT was named a Person of the Year by the New York Theatre Experience.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

Glad you asked! We’re taking a big risk on an ambitious project. Inspired by the myth of Sisyphus, Glory Road is an interactive, outdoor performance featuring a 6 ½ foot metal sphere. As the sphere rotates, it triggers sound fragments via technology housed in its core. The performance will be presented by Arts Brookfield at New York’s Grace Building Plaza September 18 – 21. It’s free and open to the public.
Sisyphus was a daring and clever king who outwitted the gods on numerous occasions. He lied, stole, and murdered for fun and profit. He was also a brilliant navigator and inventor whose knowledge surpassed mortal limits. Zeus, affronted by his insolence, sentenced him to an absurd fate: Overseen by Persephone, Queen of the Underworld, Sisyphus must forever push a boulder up a mountain only to have it roll back down.
We’re using this myth to explore questions of futility, enslavement, and self-realization. Sisyphus’ overreaching exacts a terrible price, but one which he willingly pays. He views his endless torment as a kind of victory in that Zeus was so afflicted by his cunning he assigned Sisyphus a unique punishment, equal in scope and ambition to his mortal offences. The anti-hero relishes his stubborn pride. He’s a superstar of his own making.
As a company, we’re always looking to build work that challenges expectations and speaks directly to our accelerated, media-savvy culture. Glory Road is a project that marries several different worlds: Theatre, dance, contemporary art, large-scale installation, and cutting-edge digital technology. We think it’s the place performance needs to be moving, and we invite you to take the journey with us! WHERE ARE WE AT?


The Nerve Tank has a proven track record of collaborating with designers and technicians in surprising ways and attracting audiences of varied interests and backgrounds. Our interactive installation The Attendants was presented by Arts Brookfield in 2011 to great acclaim; it was viewed worldwide via webcam, and the Village Voice called it “an important new development in performance.”
Glory Road’s main attraction, the giant sphere housing a 12-speaker array and specialized technology, is already built. We spent a long and rewarding week at The Wurks in Providence, RI welding, grinding, and bending metal to achieve a remarkable piece of kinetic sculpture. A record-breaking heat wave was no match for our intrepid fabricators.

The sphere has just been galvanized and is ready to come to New York and begin rehearsals. Our director, Melanie S. Armer, has been busy choreographing movement for Persephone and her “Minions,” and digital interface wizards Stephan Moore and Mikhail Mansion are programming sound files to respond to the sphere’s position in space as it’s pushed along the Plaza.
Costume designer Miodrag Guberinic is making a collection of beautiful, haunting pieces for our performers to wear, including an elaborate “lava dress” for Persephone (Robin Kurtz) and several jumpsuits embedded with QR codes for our faceless Minions. Video designer Chris Jordan is collaborating with co-founders Chance and Melanie to create content for the CRT screens.
WHAT DO WE NEED? WHAT DO YOU GET?

In short, we need $11,000 to offset the costs of producing Glory Road the way it—and our audience—deserve. Arts Brookfield has given us the start we need. Now, we look to you to help us create a truly memorable and groundbreaking experience.
The amount we’re asking for can be broken into three categories: Artist fees, materials, and transport. We believe in paying our performers and designers a competitive wage, so a fair chunk of our fiscal goal will be allocated to them. A significant amount will go to the purchase of large-scale set pieces such as CRT screens* and a hefty amount of red carpet. The remaining dollars will cover transportation expenses (a 600-pound, 6 ½’ steel sphere doesn’t move itself!).
Glory Road is free and open to the public. Which means we won’t be making any money with ticket sales. This is as it should be, but it’s imperative that we manage our budget with the resources we have. These resources include you, dear reader. Think of your donation as another kind of ticket to our grand spectacle.
And perks! Ah, the perks. For $25 you’ll get our company-sourced Recipes for Disaster: 13 Dishes to Get You Up and See You Through. For $50, add our all-cotton, super-swank Nerve Tank t-shirt. Want to learn to weld? How about computer coding? Jump up to $500 and receive personal, one-on-one coaching from our company members in a variety of disciplines. And for $1,000 we'll take you behind the scenes with our very special Truth or Dare perk.
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO?

Share this campaign freely and often. Visit our Facebook Page and become a fan. Get on our mailing list. And let us know if you think there’s a particular group or individual who might value our work in a meaningful way.
Crowdfunding can indeed seem like a Sisyphean task (yes, we went there). But with the support of our community we’re confident we’ll meet our goal.WHERE CAN YOU SEE IT?

I am an Artist-Teacher from Caracas, Venezuela. I am currently based in London, were I have developed as an artist and want to do so as a Teacher. By doing the 
MA in Artist Teachers & Contemporary Practices at Goldsmiths University of London.This campaign is to fund my tuition fees to enable me to be a more proficient artist and tutor, I want to fulfil this dream of becoming a teacher. By doing the two things that I love most, making art and tutoring others to finding their way. As teaching is not only a skill in which I learn everyday by challenging myself and helping others, it also supports my personal practice by not compromising as it allows me to express myself freely.



I want to give back to the community what it has given to me: invaluable experience. As it will enable me to study in one of the most important art and teaching universities worldwide. This project would not be possible without the support of others all the steps of the away, during, before and after this campaign.
Your contribution will not be for me, it will be for all of us! 
  




I am managing to cover my living expenses out of a part time job and commissions now and then. We all might be aware that London living costs can be quite high compared to other cities worldwide. 


That is why I am offering my original works, all the paintings and drawings are signed unique pieces. 






Why is it important
I have had the experience to see how art-education can change lives, I did more than 5 years of volunteer work across 3 different government and non-government institutions. Without a doubt Art-education can change the life of people and of youth worldwide. The provision of tools can set a person free and reach distant futures that go beyond expectations.
As a person who has learnt the values of life experience used with the balance of education, I too live this dream and share with the community what I have learnt and will learn.


I recognise this as a long shoot, I am not even counting that I am on the reserve list for my tuition fees scholarship, as it covers £ 5000 and it remains unknown until enrolment, one months time!
As an international student, I have no money loans in my country to study in the UK, my parents and elder sister help me with what they can. All I can say is that I have my works to give in exchange for you to help me, support myself to help others.

<div>My name is Andy Moore and I like to build strange artsy things. I have run the Voted Best Camp theme camp at Burning Man since its inception. This strange artsy thing happens to be a roller coaster located in Austin, TX. Bringing a roller coaster to the Burning Man arts festival has been a goal for a very long time and now is my opportunity to do so.</div>
<div>Originally intended for the Burning Flipside event, ridiculous weather put the kibosh on that. We are now faced with the daunting task of disassembly, transport, reassembly, and burning of the roller coaster at the Burning Man event.</div>
<div>With your help we can bring an extremely interactive sculpture to the event and hopefully terrify and thrill many an attendee!</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<div>Our funding Breaks down into 5 categories.</div>
<div>Transport: Truck rental, fuel for the truck, 2 nights motel stay, and food for the road trip.</div>
<div>Completion of Roller Coaster: Paint, a better winch, lumber for proper staircase, screws, roller coaster hardware, and lights.</div>
<div>Scwhag: All of the rad perks that we are offering!</div>
<div>Burning of Sculpture: Decomposed Granite, metal rakes, trashcans, and landfill costs.</div>
<div>Camp Costs: Lumber for structure, food, generator fuel, and landfill costs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our perks cover a wide spectrum. Some let the contributor proudly display where their money has been well spent. Some grant the generous contributor preview rides here in Austin, TX. And a few lucky and wonderfully generous contributors will be given all access passes to the running of the roller coaster and accompanying Voted Best Camp.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If we do not reach our goal our funds will be put towards the Voted Best Camp art project which has been showering the Burning Man art festival with laughter and fun for many years.</div> <p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<div>This is the first year that the core Voted Best Camp team will be venturing into the open playa with their building skills. Having brought 11 successful skateboard halfpipes to the desert, this team knows curvy wooden structure building well. The roller coaster is an evolution on the skateboard ramp. It's already totally built, too! We just need to polish it up a bit, break it down, and get this thing out to the desert!</div> <p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<div>One of our main risks is the transport of the coaster across the country. We plan to allow ourselves plenty of time for flat tires and weather delays. We have the team with which to transport it, just not the transport itself. Another risk is that of bodily injury moving the pieces of the roller coaster. There needs to be sufficient hands on big pieces to avoid getting hurt. These hands then require food, lodging, and transport. Additionally, this thing promises to make a big mess in the desert. Sufficient persons will be required to clean it up properly and they require the same things as the movers and builders. Allowing ourselves enough people and time will make overcoming these challenges much easier.</div> <p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<div>Even if you can't give any money you can still help us out very much so! Spread the word around the internet and shamelessly help Voted Best Camp promote their roller coaster! Thank you for your time.- Andy</div>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>More About The AjA Project's Large Scale Installations</b></h3>
<p>The AjA Project has been using using photography installations to elevate the voices of San Diego’s marginalized communities for a long time. To do so, we work with a team of professional local artists to create stunning large-scale art pieces. These pieces showcase the images and narrative created by immigrants, refugees and other marginalized populations through AjA’s community-based photography programs. We purposefully install the finished pieces in parts of San Diego where immigrant and refugee voices are often left out of the community conversation; in this way, we use art to raise the awareness about marginalized people living right here in San Diego, and spark critical community dialogue around important social issues.</p>

<div>AjA was founded in 2000 (15 years ago!), and we've been providing tools and opportunities for at-risk youth and marginalized communities to reclaim and tell their own stories. Why is this important? Because if you've been told the same story all your life about who you are, and who you will become, you'll begin to believe it. For the people AjA works with, they've been told that their fate is to join a gang, do drugs, struggle in school, and live a life of poverty.

We've had a generous donor step up and offer to match the next $500 in contributions, dollar for dollar. Your $15 donation is now worth $30! Your $100 donation is worth $200! 
Only 60 hours left in the campaign...now is the time!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Still don't have a Christmas gift for that special someone? Give the gift of art, social justice...and fashion. For your $100 contribution in your name or that of a loved one, you'll receive a beautiful scarf or bag woven by Karen refugees. (We will contact you for your choice of bag or scarf.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE! AjA in the news! 



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are so many debates happening right now about refugees and immigrants...but how often do you hear directly from refugees and immigrants themselves about their experiences? In San Diego alone, almost one out of every four people is an immigrant or refugee. Each person has a story to tell, and a contribution to make to our city. Their voices are a critical part of the political conversations happening today, and yet their voices often go unheard.  

We have a tremendous opportunity to use photography to elevate the voices of refugees and immigrants.


The San Diego International Airport is allowing us to install a 26 foot by 8 foot mural right at the entrance of Terminal 2, for an entire year. 17 million people travel through in that time. The mural will feature the portraits of refugees and immigrants, along with their stories of coming to the United States. We’ve already had a couple really successful community-based workshops to create the images and narratives, and the stories are incredibly powerful. 





The mural will tell a story of resilience, of strength, and of hope. Even more importantly, it’ll serve as an inspiration for empathy, reflection, and conversation for millions of travelers from around the world. 



But We Need Your Financial Support.
We're trying to raise $5000 by New Year’s eve in order to get the mural up by January 15th. Your support of $5 or more will ensure we can make it happen.
All the money raised through this campaign will support AjA's 2016 Public Art Fund, of which Flight+Paths will be the centerpiece installation. Please give $5 or more now to support this important cause.


""When I first came to the US, my speaking was unexplainable to people around me. They don’t even know what I talk. That was a big strange event of my life. But changing is never ending, and I met The AjA Project. They teach me how to use photography to express myself. I was afraid to talk but I was not scared to take picture. That’s how I start changing my life.” - Cuc, from Vietnam

<p style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 150%;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">In 1982, I had a dream in which I was told that I would be receiving an inheritance of great value from an unknown ancestor. Within a few days after that dream, through a series of synchronisic events, I realized that my inheritance was the Tarot and I received a deck as a gift from a friend. I had known about the Tarot before this but the magical events that were initiated by my dream focused my attention on the Tarot as never before and I came to see the deck as part of my personal spiritual journey. From that day on the Tarot has become the primary focus of my work as an artist, a scholar, and a philosopher. </span></span></span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 150%;""><br/><br/></p>
<p style=""line-height: 150%;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In 1987, while studying an alchemical illustration representing the Philosopher's Stone, I had a revelation that this image was symbolically interchangeable with the Tarot's World card. This realization was like a key that opened a lock to a forgotten door. I sat mesmerized as images poured out of this new portal in my mind, forming a parade of alchemical illustrations that were spontaneously paired with Tarot trumps. It became obvious that the trumps can be alchemical, and that the series of trumps describes the alchemical Opus. </span></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This insight led me into more research, writing, and drawing and after eight years the result was the Alchemical Tarot The Alchemical Tarot was originally published by Harper/Collins in London, in 1995. That edition is now out of print but it became world famous and copies have sold for over $2,000. I recovered the rights to the deck and self-published two new editions (the last edition was funded by my previous campaign on Indiegogo). I have also rewritten the companion book, expanding greatly on the historic background and insights into symbolism. I self-published it as, </span><em><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Alchemy and the Tarot</span></em><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. The Art from the deck has been exhibited at the Tarot Museum in Riola, Italy and at the LA Craft and Folkart Museum, and appeared on numerous television shows. </span></span></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 150%;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Meanwhile, I continued to work on new decks and books, I designed and authored the Tarot of the Saints, The Angels Tarot, the Buddha Tarot, and the Vampire Tarot. I authored </span><em><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination,</span></em><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> which the American Library Association said may be the best book ever written on the subject. I have taught about the Tarot at Omega, the NY Open Center, and the Readers Studio, curated a Tarot exhibition for the LA Craft and Folkart Museum, lectured regularly on the Tarot at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, appeared in documentaries produced by the BBC and independent film makers, and cut the ribbon at opening of the Tarot Museum in Italy. I have become recognized as an expert and a scholar of the Tarot. Through all of this activity, however, I was working in my spare time on a new Tarot deck that would be the culmination and synthesis of all my art and scholarship. This is the Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery, a deck that I have been working on for at least ten years and that is now ready for publication. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 150%;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I started on The Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery because of my love of the 19</span><sup><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">th</span></sup><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> century Pre-Raphaelite paintings of Edward Burne-Jones, with their melancholy, otherworldly settings, peopled by tall, pale, stunningly beautiful women and equally memorable heroic men. Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites believed that art was a spiritual or magical endeavor and toward this end they formed a mystical brotherhood of English artists dedicated to recapturing the sincerity of the art of the early Renaissance-the same period that gave us the Tarot. Burne-Jones was one of the most prominent artists in this movement and it was the work of these artists and mystics that created the fertile soil in which the Golden Dawn took root. </span></span></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Burne-Jones based his tall female “stunners” and melancholy heroes on the paintings of Botticelli and Michelangelo, two artists whose works are considered primary examples of Renaissance Neoplatonic mysticism. His work expresses the Renaissance ideal that physical beauty and spiritual beauty are linked in one continuum that can lead to the mystical experience of beauty itself, as a timeless, underlying reality. Plato described this reality as a radiant light that is the true food of the soul. He said that this light is made of the true essence of Virtue, a higher quality of virtue, beyond mere codes of behavior. In the Renaissance, artists, like Botticelli, symbolized this spiritual essence as an ideal female nude and my studies have shown that it is this ideal that allowed early Tarot artists to place a nude on the World card as a symbol of the primary beauty.</span></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Because Burne-Jones was inspired by the beauty and symbolism of the 15<sup>th</sup> century, it is not surprising that he painted many of the same themes that we find in the Tarot, such as Temperance, Lovers, and the Wheel of Fortune. It seemed to me that he was creating a Tarot but he never finished it. I started this deck with a desire to finish Burne-Jones's Tarot for him. I wanted to see what a deck would look like if it were done in his style and with his sense of sensuality and symbolism. I also realized that it would express the Neoplatonic ideal that I believed was expressed in the Tarot from its origin. By proceeding with this intent, this deck became a bridge between the art and occult symbolism of the 19th century and the iconography and mystical philosophy of the 15<sup>th</sup> century. It shows that they are both rooted in the perennial mystery that is like a golden thread running through Western History. </span></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">In Neoplatonic mysticism, numbers are used as symbols and the numbers three and seven are of primary importance. As testament to its Neoplatonic origin, the Tarot has a 5th suit composed of an unnumbered Fool and three times seven trumps. Plato theorized that each person has three souls: the Sole of Appetite, the Soul of Will, and the Soul of Reason, which he symbolized as a chariot with two winged horses and a driver. These three represented a spiritual hierarchy and as individuals developed and balanced each soul through the practice of virtue they were able to advance spiritually and operate at a higher soul level. The keys to spiritual advancement were the Cardinal Virtues. Plato and later philosophers assigned three virtues, one to each of the soul levels, and these are the same three that are depicted in the Tarot: Temperance to the Soul of Appetite, Strength to the Soul of Will, and Justice to the Soul of Reason. If we divide the twenty-one trumps into three groups of seven we find the theme of each group corresponds sequentially to these three soul levels and the sequence also depicts the three virtues that are necessary to bring them into balance. </span></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">In Plato's theory the complete set of Cardinal Virtues contained a forth called Prudence. In the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, philosophers theorized that the forth virtue. Prudence, contained the other three. So that Temperance, Strength, and Justice were the three virtues necessary to develop the totality that was Prudence. In this view, Prudence represented not just wisdom but a mystical state of enlightenment that was reached when the lesser three virtues brought the soul levels into balance and health. In the Tarot, Prudence is represented by the World card, which represents Prudence as a Botticelli-like beautiful nude. Philosophers equated her with the Soul of the World, which helps to explain the title of the trump. Her Christian counterpart was Sophia, the wisdom of God, who was said to be the mother of the three Christian virtues: Faith, Hope, and Charity. With these three the total number of virtues is brought up to seven and this is the sevenfold mystery. </span></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The importance of the number seven was derived from its role in ancient cosmology. From the ancient world until the late Renaissance, the Earth was believed to be the unmoving center of the universe and the fixed stars, formed into constellations, revolved around the Earth from east to west. Between the fixed stars and the Earth, there were believed to be a series of seven crystal spheres, forming seven layers each one closer to the stars as they ascended. On each sphere the ancients placed a planet that orbited independently from the fixed stars. When the sky is viewed with the naked eye, the planets are the only celestial objects that seem to do this. The planets were each named after a god; from the bottom up, they were: Luna, Mercury, Venus, Sol, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The planets were, also, believed to from a ladder between Heaven and Earth that the soul would descend at birth and at each planet the soul was given certain qualities by the god of the planet. These qualities are the source of the lists or seven virtues and seven vices. </span></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The seven planets were thought of as the soul centers of the cosmos and corresponding soul centers could be found ascending the spine, from the sacrum to the crown of the head, in the microcosm of the human body. Pythagoras developed the diatonic music scale with seven notes to capture the sound that each planet made as it orbited the Earth. This was called the music of the spheres. He marked each note with one of the seven vowels of the Greek alphabet and through a musical treatment used this scale to bring the human soul centers into harmony with the planets. These notes functioned as virtues meant to heal each soul center. Later, lists of seven virtues meant to cure seven vices-each associated with a soul center-began to appear in Hermetic, Gnostic, and mystical Christian philosophy. I believe that the Tarot’s trumps depict Virtue driving an ascent through the seven soul centers depicted repeatedly on three levels, corresponding to the three Platonic soul levels. The final achievement of this ascent is illustrated on the Soul of the World card, which depicts Prudence/Sophia as the light of higher consciousness and the true food of the soul. </span></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">My Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery is designed to illustrate and clarify this mystical heritage found in the series of the trumps. The four minor suits are based on the work I did for the Alchemical Tarot but in a Pre-Raphaelite style and with a stronger connection with traditional decks. The deck will come with a little white book and eventually there will be a companion book. Meanwhile, the philosophy of the trumps is explained fully in chapter four of my <em>Alchemy and the Tarot</em>, and the descriptions of the alchemical minor suits in chapter seven will be applicable to this new deck.</span></span></p>

In 1982, I had a dream in which I was told that I would be receiving an inheritance of great value from an unknown ancestor. Within a few days after that dream, through a series of synchronisic events, I realized that my inheritance was the Tarot and I received a deck as a gift from a friend. I had known about the Tarot before this but the magical events that were initiated by my dream focused my attention on the Tarot as never before and I came to see the deck as part of my personal spiritual journey. From that day on the Tarot has become the primary focus of my work as an artist, a scholar, and a philosopher. 

In 1987, while studying an alchemical illustration representing the Philosopher's Stone, I had a revelation that this image was symbolically interchangeable with the Tarot's World card. This realization was like a key that opened a lock to a forgotten door. I sat mesmerized as images poured out of this new portal in my mind, forming a parade of alchemical illustrations that were spontaneously paired with Tarot trumps. It became obvious that the trumps can be alchemical, and that the series of trumps describes the alchemical Opus. This insight led me into more research, writing, and drawing and after eight years the result was the Alchemical Tarot The Alchemical Tarot was originally published by Harper/Collins in London, in 1995. That edition is now out of print but it became world famous and copies have sold for over $2,000. I recovered the rights to the deck and self-published two new editions (the last edition was funded by my previous campaign on Indiegogo). I have also rewritten the companion book, expanding greatly on the historic background and insights into symbolism. I self-published it as, Alchemy and the Tarot. The Art from the deck has been exhibited at the Tarot Museum in Riola, Italy and at the LA Craft and Folkart Museum, and appeared on numerous television shows. 
Meanwhile, I continued to work on new decks and books, I designed and authored the Tarot of the Saints, The Angels Tarot, the Buddha Tarot, and the Vampire Tarot. I authored The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination, which the American Library Association said may be the best book ever written on the subject. I have taught about the Tarot at Omega, the NY Open Center, and the Readers Studio, curated a Tarot exhibition for the LA Craft and Folkart Museum, lectured regularly on the Tarot at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, appeared in documentaries produced by the BBC and independent film makers, and cut the ribbon at opening of the Tarot Museum in Italy. I have become recognized as an expert and a scholar of the Tarot. Through all of this activity, however, I was working in my spare time on a new Tarot deck that would be the culmination and synthesis of all my art and scholarship. This is the Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery, a deck that I have been working on for at least ten years and that is now ready for publication. 

The Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery
I started on The Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery because of my love of the 19th century Pre-Raphaelite paintings of Edward Burne-Jones, with their melancholy, otherworldly settings, peopled by tall, pale, stunningly beautiful women and equally memorable heroic men. Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites believed that art was a spiritual or magical endeavor and toward this end they formed a mystical brotherhood of English artists dedicated to recapturing the sincerity of the art of the early Renaissance-the same period that gave us the Tarot. Burne-Jones was one of the most prominent artists in this movement and it was the work of these artists and mystics that created the fertile soil in which the Golden Dawn took root. 
 
Burne-Jones based his tall female “stunners” and melancholy heroes on the paintings of Botticelli and Michelangelo, two artists whose works are considered primary examples of Renaissance Neoplatonic mysticism. His work expresses the Renaissance ideal that physical beauty and spiritual beauty are linked in one continuum that can lead to the mystical experience of beauty itself, as a timeless, underlying reality. Plato described this reality as a radiant light that is the true food of the soul. He said that this light is made of the true essence of Virtue, a higher quality of virtue, beyond mere codes of behavior. In the Renaissance, artists, like Botticelli, symbolized this spiritual essence as an ideal female nude and my studies have shown that it is this ideal that allowed early Tarot artists to place a nude on the World card as a symbol of the primary beauty.
 
Because Burne-Jones was inspired by the beauty and symbolism of the 15th century, it is not surprising that he painted many of the same themes that we find in the Tarot, such as Temperance, Lovers, and the Wheel of Fortune. It seemed to me that he was creating a Tarot but he never finished it. I started this deck with a desire to finish Burne-Jones's Tarot for him. I wanted to see what a deck would look like if it were done in his style and with his sense of sensuality and symbolism. I also realized that it would express the Neoplatonic ideal that I believed was expressed in the Tarot from its origin. By proceeding with this intent, this deck became a bridge between the art and occult symbolism of the 19th century and the iconography and mystical philosophy of the 15th century. It shows that they are both rooted in the perennial mystery that is like a golden thread running through Western History. 
 
In Neoplatonic mysticism, numbers are used as symbols and the numbers three and seven are of primary importance. As testament to its Neoplatonic origin, the Tarot has a 5th suit composed of an unnumbered Fool and three times seven trumps. Plato theorized that each person has three souls: the Sole of Appetite, the Soul of Will, and the Soul of Reason, which he symbolized as a chariot with two winged horses and a driver. These three represented a spiritual hierarchy and as individuals developed and balanced each soul through the practice of virtue they were able to advance spiritually and operate at a higher soul level. The keys to spiritual advancement were the Cardinal Virtues. Plato and later philosophers assigned three virtues, one to each of the soul levels, and these are the same three that are depicted in the Tarot: Temperance to the Soul of Appetite, Strength to the Soul of Will, and Justice to the Soul of Reason. If we divide the twenty-one trumps into three groups of seven we find the theme of each group corresponds sequentially to these three soul levels and the sequence also depicts the three virtues that are necessary to bring them into balance. 
 
In Plato's theory the complete set of Cardinal Virtues contained a forth called Prudence. In the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, philosophers theorized that the forth virtue. Prudence, contained the other three. So that Temperance, Strength, and Justice were the three virtues necessary to develop the totality that was Prudence. In this view, Prudence represented not just wisdom but a mystical state of enlightenment that was reached when the lesser three virtues brought the soul levels into balance and health. In the Tarot, Prudence is represented by the World card, which represents Prudence as a Botticelli-like beautiful nude. Philosophers equated her with the Soul of the World, which helps to explain the title of the trump. Her Christian counterpart was Sophia, the wisdom of God, who was said to be the mother of the three Christian virtues: Faith, Hope, and Charity. With these three the total number of virtues is brought up to seven and this is the sevenfold mystery. 
 
The importance of the number seven was derived from its role in ancient cosmology. From the ancient world until the late Renaissance, the Earth was believed to be the unmoving center of the universe and the fixed stars, formed into constellations, revolved around the Earth from east to west. Between the fixed stars and the Earth, there were believed to be a series of seven crystal spheres, forming seven layers each one closer to the stars as they ascended. On each sphere the ancients placed a planet that orbited independently from the fixed stars. When the sky is viewed with the naked eye, the planets are the only celestial objects that seem to do this. The planets were each named after a god; from the bottom up, they were: Luna, Mercury, Venus, Sol, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The planets were, also, believed to from a ladder between Heaven and Earth that the soul would descend at birth and at each planet the soul was given certain qualities by the god of the planet. These qualities are the source of the lists or seven virtues and seven vices. 
 
The seven planets were thought of as the soul centers of the cosmos and corresponding soul centers could be found ascending the spine, from the sacrum to the crown of the head, in the microcosm of the human body. Pythagoras developed the diatonic music scale with seven notes to capture the sound that each planet made as it orbited the Earth. This was called the music of the spheres. He marked each note with one of the seven vowels of the Greek alphabet and through a musical treatment used this scale to bring the human soul centers into harmony with the planets. These notes functioned as virtues meant to heal each soul center. Later, lists of seven virtues meant to cure seven vices-each associated with a soul center-began to appear in Hermetic, Gnostic, and mystical Christian philosophy. I believe that the Tarot’s trumps depict Virtue driving an ascent through the seven soul centers depicted repeatedly on three levels, corresponding to the three Platonic soul levels. The final achievement of this ascent is illustrated on the Soul of the World card, which depicts Prudence/Sophia as the light of higher consciousness and the true food of the soul. 
 
My Tarot of the Sevenfold Mystery is designed to illustrate and clarify this mystical heritage found in the series of the trumps. The four minor suits are based on the work I did for the Alchemical Tarot but in a Pre-Raphaelite style and with a stronger connection with traditional decks. The deck will come with a little white book and eventually there will be a companion book. Meanwhile, the philosophy of the trumps is explained fully in chapter four of my Alchemy and the Tarot, and the descriptions of the alchemical minor suits in chapter seven will be applicable to this new deck.
