Very little because our team has a combined 30+ years in the fashion industry, so we're no strangers to garment design, manufacturing and filling orders. 
All our product development is already finished, we took ""the risk"" and pre-funded initial production to launch our first campaign on kickstarter in March. We became a staff pick in the first hour of that campaign and we managed to ship over half our backers in the weeks following our succesful campaign. We have delivered and more than met the expectations of many consumers with a very well made luxurious product.  Check out our reveiws on our website and Facebook page! 
We produce ""batches"" of sweatshirts of the highest quality. Please check out the photo Gallery
THESE ARE NOT PROTOTYPES !  no guessing what fabric you will receive, our products look, feel and fit great.  Check out our reveiws! 

The Team and I THANK YOU SO much for the support!

<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/davejawu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dave Wu</a> and I’m a Photographer/Creative based out in New York/New Jersey. Color Blanc is a passion project I started last year with the hopes of becoming a full fledged fashion brand. After working in streetwear and fashion for several years, I realized that I had a passion for clothing. From the initial sketch to the manufacturing of the final product, I’ve learned the ins and outs of starting a fashion/lifestyle brand from the ground up.</p>
<p>For the last year, I’ve spent all my time and savings doing market research, designing, and testing out different factories. Now, I am ready to start the next step in the process and I need your help. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE PROCESS</h3>
<p>Making a clothing brand is not an easy process. There are those who slap designs onto some pre-made shirts for a quick buck, and then there are those who take the time to make thought out designs come to life.  The latter, making custom cut and sew apparel, is a very tedious and expensive process. Therefore, all funding for this campaign will go towards the following:</p>
<p><strong>-Raw Materials: </strong>This includes fabrics, hardware (buttons, zippers, accessories, etc). Probably one of the most labor intensive parts of the whole process. Finding the right high quality materials is just as important as the designs themselves. </p>
<p><strong>-Pattern Making:</strong> This is the process of creating stencils of each part of the design. From the collar to the sleeves, the pattern maker meticulously measures and draws out each piece to make sure it can be replicated. </p>
<p><strong>-Sample Making:</strong> This is where it all comes together. The cut out patterns are sewn together, buttons and zippers are attached, and the first design sample comes to life. </p>
<p><strong>-Grading:</strong> This is the process of creating different sizes for each design. </p>
<p>This process is repeated for each individual design. Sometimes the first sample comes out just the way you pictures, but most of the time not. After many alterations to the sample or even scrapping a sample for a completely different design, the final sample is ready for production. </p>
<p>Palette #000001 will be produced exclusively in Seoul, South Korea, a place known for it's rich textile history and A1 quality when it comes to manufacturing. I will be spending 3 months there this Spring designing, sourcing, and producing the samples for the inaugural collection.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>This project has been a dream of mine for a long time. With this campaign and the samples created with it, I’ll be able to showcase to retailers to carry my clothing, shoot editorials for magazines, and create catalogs for sales/marketing. None of this can happen without the sampling process.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this one collection, can lead to financial stability for the company and the ability to create future collections. I would love to be able to keep on creating awesome clothing for everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>No project is without its challenges. To be as transparent as possible in this campaign, I’ve listed a few below:</p>
<p>-There is never just ONE sample. It often takes several to get a design right and that is what makes this process so labor intensive and costly. </p>
<p>-The rising cost of production could affect the number of designs made. Inflation is real. </p>
<p>-People might not like the designs at all (not likely, but still a possibility)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</h3>
<p>We've launched a small collection of enamel pins to raise money for the sampling process. You can purchase on our website at <a href=""http://www.colorblanc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.colorblanc.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you can't donate monetarily, sharing on your social channels is just as helpful! Exposure is welcome :)</p>

No compromise. We are on a mission to offer unique and creative designs on durable organic garments. We refrain from the old boring, quick money making, computer generated images. Each and every one of our hand-drawn designs has gone through hours of design and development. With your help, we can all enjoy creative art on quality organic garments. <br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 24px;background-color: initial;"">Why should we settle for brands that sell us clothing that is deliberately designed to fall apart in a year? You should not have to worry about washing your T-shirt, and because its going to lose its shape. Most high fashion brands engineer their apparel to fall apart within a year, so you keep coming back for more. This creates a cycle of consumption and waste which has become very common lately. Clothing should be made to last a lifetime. Our aim is to change that cycle of waste, offering only the best garments with beautiful designs, that will last and be admired wherever you go!<br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 24px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>Our aim is to spread the word, grow and invite you to come and have a taste of what we have produced. Will be our best achievement to set up a creative design studio, where we will continue to work tirelessly to deliver the best design apparel that will keep giving back for our cause.</p>
<p><b>WHAT YOU GET</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What you will get is a quality premium organic cotton t-shirt, with a unique hand-drawn and silk screen-printed design, embellished with official Swarovski crystals.

It was then that he set up a small business selling his prints to women in the local community, who would sew the designs into various items of clothing. From this sparked Danny's interest in apparel design and production.</p><p>Danny moved to the UK where he studied graphic design and architecture, then in 2012, Duo Du London was founded. From the designer's London apartment, he sketches unique, tribal-like designs using calligraphic pens and Chinese inks. The detail behind the designs is likened to tattoo artwork - with an aboriginal edge.</p><p>Danny's final images are then screen printed onto a range of carefully selected soft, organic cotton fabrics. The garments are also finished with official Swarovski crystals to add a little bit of class to the final product.</p><p>The brand is named after Danny's late mother – Duo Du London's biggest fan. The brand prides itself on its production of comfortable, high quality, yet affordable, garments. The customer is guaranteed total care from design to distribution of each item of clothing.</p>

</div>","DUO DU LONDON - WEAR A UNIQUE STATEMENTTshirts that keep on giving back. For every tshirt bought, we will donate £1 to Penny Brohn Cancer Care Centre. Our Garments are all organic premium cotton with hand drawn designs. Silk screen printed and embellished with Official Swarovski crystals.WHY WE ARE DOING THISDuo Du London believes in offering only the best, that exists. No compromise. We are on a mission to offer unique and creative designs on durable organic garments. We refrain from the old boring, quick money making, computer generated images. Each and every one of our hand-drawn designs has gone through hours of design and development. With your help, we can all enjoy creative art on quality organic garments. Why should we settle for brands that sell us clothing that is deliberately designed to fall apart in a year? You should not have to worry about washing your T-shirt, and because its going to lose its shape. Most high fashion brands engineer their apparel to fall apart within a year, so you keep coming back for more. This creates a cycle of consumption and waste which has become very common lately. Clothing should be made to last a lifetime. Our aim is to change that cycle of waste, offering only the best garments with beautiful designs, that will last and be admired wherever you go!WHAT WE NEED
Our aim is to spread the word, grow and invite you to come and have a taste of what we have produced. Will be our best achievement to set up a creative design studio, where we will continue to work tirelessly to deliver the best design apparel that will keep giving back for our cause.
WHAT YOU GET
What you will get is a quality premium organic cotton t-shirt, with a unique hand-drawn and silk screen-printed design, embellished with official Swarovski crystals. Garment that are eco-friendly, with aesthetically pleasing designs for you to cherish years and years to come.





THE STORYDesigner Danny Kay Duod grew up in Ghana, where from a young age, using his own designs, he began to personally explore the process of screen printing onto cloth. It was then that he set up a small business selling his prints to women in the local community, who would sew the designs into various items of clothing. From this sparked Danny's interest in apparel design and production.Danny moved to the UK where he studied graphic design and architecture, then in 2012, Duo Du London was founded. From the designer's London apartment, he sketches unique, tribal-like designs using calligraphic pens and Chinese inks. The detail behind the designs is likened to tattoo artwork - with an aboriginal edge.Danny's final images are then screen printed onto a range of carefully selected soft, organic cotton fabrics. The garments are also finished with official Swarovski crystals to add a little bit of class to the final product.The brand is named after Danny's late mother – Duo Du London's biggest fan. The brand prides itself on its production of comfortable, high quality, yet affordable, garments. The customer is guaranteed total care from design to distribution of each item of clothing.

<p>My name is Gam Calderon. I'm currently a
student at Hillsborough community college. I love fashion, it’s been a way to
be very outspoken without necessarily saying anything. I wanted to go straight into
the field when I got out of high school, unfortunately, funding was a bit of an
issue. I didn't give up, I'm getting all my basic classes out of the way but
keeping a blog and interning for a stylist. I'm trying to make it on my own, as
many of you know that's not easy! I'm planning my first big fashion show and I
will be showcasing local boutiques that like me want to make a name for themselves.
The fashion show will serve as a network to create business relations between designers,
models and stylist all from the Tampa area. We are also showcasing local
restaurants and vendors that will be selling their products to the guests. I know the fashion world can be rather superficial;
therefore, I want to make this fashion show different! All of our models are diverse in their own way,
we have every size, color, nationality. Our models are students from Riverview
High School and Hillsborough Community College. We've also extended an
invitation to ""The Fashion Movement"" an organization that helps girls
in low income or troubled households become models. If you're a business owner
and wish to do more for this campaign there are Sponsorship Opportunities. A <i>“Twitter wall”</i> will be created for the
fashion show. This platform will bring the audience even closer with the
concept of the show and the cause that it’s supporting</p>
<p>We are also doing a huge clothing drive the
day of the event! All guest are required to bring at least two partially used
pieces of clothing! Regardless if it's out of style, there's always someone in
need who will gladly take it. We have partnered up with Metropolitan Ministries
of Tampa to give articles of clothing to people in need. Men, Women, Children
the list is endless! The feeling of doing what you love and giving to those in
need at the same time has no comparison. Studies show that millions of people
in America are in need of clothes. Please, help us lower this statistic. Nobody
should be denied the opportunity to have clothes on their back.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Although monetary donations are always
appreciated, The House Of Gam wants to encourage everyone to donate to
Metropolitan Ministries. This organization has been helping many people in need
for years and we all hope that can continue to carry their humanitarian mission</p>
<p>To donate clothes please send all packages to

We started Fuchsia Shoes to bring top quality handmade traditional styles shoes from Pakistan to the fashion hungry market of women’s footwear. Our brand, Fuchsia, reflects the themes behind our designs: vivid, elegant and full of life.

Fuchsia is so more than a fashion brand. Fuchsia is a movement that connects industry artisans, who have mastered the centuries old eastern art of shoe making, to the western marketplace.
Our intricate handmade embroidery is designed with the intention to fuse the western and eastern fashion in a subtle and contemporary way. Quality and comfort are our unwavering tenants - Every Fuchsia shoe is handmade by artisans who pour in their individual creativity, passion and love.


   


A few weeks of craftsmanship goes into every pair of fashionable shoes from Fuchsia. The process begins with an approach that blends centuries of tradition, as we start each pair with the blank slate of beautiful and individual imperfections of natural leather, with each individual craftsman lovingly and painstakingly tying each knot and sewing every seam.

Pioneering breakthrough scientific research, SensDog team is developing and introducing a new technology platform in human-dog communication. Hard science Contrary to other products on the market, SensDog is not just an idea based on some scientific presumption. It’s an ongoing program where data is continuously collected and scientific results inform development of the SensDog application on an ongoing basis.Supporting science SensDog is not just a revolutionary new product! In our research program, our ambition is to build a novel business and science management model that facilitates and supports sharing the latest research findings with the public as we believe doing so will change our and our dogs’ world for the better.Building a community Our aim is not merely to gain resources for launching the product but also to build a community whose members could partake in the development and research process with their dogs and share our enthusiasm and passion to improve the lives of our best friends. Anybody, even those who don’t send any money, can join us! Of course, we appreciate any support that helps launch the SensDog project.Thanks in advance :)SensDog - contrary to today’s smart collars – works on a behavioral level. It doesn’t just say that your dog is active or passive but it knows exactly what your dog is doing. Based on this advanced behavior sensing technology SensDog as a sensdevice is able to construct a detailed yet holistic picture of your dog's emotional and physical state throughout days, months, and years.Collecting and analyzing behavior data in real time and delivering both a summary and a detailed analysis of four aspects of your dog’s days:Happiness - it’s about emotional balance. You can immediately know what makes your dog happy/sad, what causes them relief/stress, and how their emotions change over time. It basically tells you how your dog is feeling and why.Wellness - it’s about body and physical wellbeing. Is your dog in good shape, sleeps and rests well, eats and drinks enough? Are there any health or weight issues that you should know in advance? Were there any behavioral changes that you should pay attention to?Friendship -it’s about your dog’s social connections, like who is leader in the pack or in the park. How is your dog feeling about other dogs, who are their friends or loved ones?Parentship - are you a good guardian of your furry friend? How close is your connection, are there any problems in the family? Are you getting closer over time? Did your dog’s feelings change towards you?          We had the privilege to try SensDog on wolfs with the help of Zoltan Horkai, an expert in training wolves and well-known from the series “Zoltan the Wolf Man” that aired on Animal Planet and Discovery Channel. We conducted a comparative study with wolves at the Horkai Animal Training Center and although compared to dogs, we found minor differences, SensDog worked well with their closest natural relatives; wolves. New possibilities in animal training Based on our experience and discussions with animal trainers like Zoltan, SensDog could help animal trainers - especially wild animal trainers. SensDog could be useful to these trainers in solving difficult training problems even remotely, getting feedback about the animals’ critical emotional, physical, and social conditions and avoiding problems.Hey guys, who'd like to be the next? Zoltan Horkai is fixing a prototype collar on his wolves 1. SENSDOG USERPERSONAL DATA Sensdog App collects, stores and analyses data on your phone so you can access the data whenever (even without internet).2. SENSDOG CLOUDWORLDWIDE DATA SensDog servers collect and process data from around the world. These data inform both future research of the SensDog Lab and application development.3. SENSDOG LABRESEARCH DATA SensDog team processes large amount of data collected from around the world and continues the scientific study of behavioral mechanisms to inform the next generation of SensDog devices. All the while, we keep our users connected and give them feedback about their dog’s behavior. 4. SENSDOG SOFTWAREDEVELOPMENT SensDog team continuously improves and upgrades SensDog software based on research results and user feedback.Dogs around an M.R.I. machine from the lab's latest Science article (September 2016)Prestigious academic research team Prof. Adam Miklosi and his team is one of the most successful research laboratories in the field of dog behavior which  also hosts the largest research group in the world that is dedicated to investigating dog behavior and dog-human interaction (‘Family Dog Project’). More than 40 researchers and students with diverse backgrounds, such as in biology, psychology, and veterinary medicine are collaborating on projects focused, beyond animal behavior, on animal robotics, behavioral ecology, bio-acoustics, cognitive neuroethology, and human-computer interaction.Articles in Science and other scientific journals The Family Dog Project team has several papers published in high quality journals, including in the most prestigious journals like Science, Current Biology and Trends in Cognitive Sciences.Prof. Adam Miklosi is author of several well-respected books on dog behavior such as Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition (2nd Edition, Oxford University Press) and is one of the top lecturers on the topic in the world.He even played a role in a popular show on Sky Television as a key member of a team that trained shelter dogs to drive an airplane. Partnering with Victoria Stilwell, the show titled Dogs Might Fly aired in Great Britain in 2016.    ​From the beginning of the design process it was clear that a next generation device and the dog collar of the future deserves a unique look. This was not a simple aesthetic consideration but one that was constrained by the need for functionality, too. So, we kept it as comfortable and light as possible but also added the option to change elements in case of newly needed functions. The technical specifications could vary, depending on the Apple Watch model you attach. Works with any Apple Watch model which is available now including first edition Apple Watch.Kick off idea SensDog comes from earlier research wherein dogs – wearing harnesses with an accelerometer and GPS to allow for researchers to follow and record their behavior – were trained to work with drones to find people in emergency situations, such as an avalanche. Smaller device with a bigger computing capacity In the midst of many interesting results we realized that a real breakthrough necessitated a smaller device with a bigger computing capacity and advanced and reliable communication technology. Thus came the idea that instead of developing a new device, we should capitalize on the most advanced device on the market and integrating it with our innovative solutions.Apple Watch as an embedded device This was when we decided to choose the best wearable technology and started to use the Apple Watch and Apple software technology. Doing so we avoided all hardware limitations of similar products and could focus on the software which is the most important factor when building a next generation sensdevice. This is a decision we will never regret! Collar with modular design Armed with this technology we could go back to the drawing board and make a case and a collar that not only embed the Apple Watch but extend its capabilities with a new modular design that permits future development.The next step was the most difficult one and it took quite some time. The only known possibility of recording and analyzing the behavior of an organism at the time was a very cumbersome process that necessitates special conditions and environment.Real time behavior recording We thus had to develop a new method that could analyze the behavior of the dog, in real time and with the precision we wanted. Everything else is history, as we are proud to introduce SensDog, the world’s first device that could do exactly this. With the new method, we can also incorporate all prior and latest scientific results, producing the first really smart device for dogs, with endless future possibilities. Entrepreneur  and creative with multinational corporate and startup management experience, the head of operation. Expert on digital communication and iOS app development with extended advertising agency background with top clients and brands like PEPSI, Lays, Cheetos, Pfizer, Bayer, HERTZ, SaraLee. He has a Master's Degree in biology.  Minimizing risks The main reason why we selected Apple Watch and Apple software platform is simple: closing out as much technical issue as possible and keep focusing on the usage of the product. This decision is the key to avoid the technical traps - where most promising ideas fail - and ensure that our backers will get what and when they except, and deliver the highest possible standard of quality and consistency.Unexpected issues We have done our best to plan for every possible issue but obviously unexpected issues can arise, but we promise that we will keep our backers informed at all times when this happen.Deliveries We will be using signed for delivery with insurance to post out all perks, delivery times will vary from a couple of days to a week or so depending on your location in the world, a tracking number will be sent to you.Quality Control Every product will be packed and checked by us before it is shipped to backers to avoid any issue during daily usage.Customer Service It's part of the cooperation with our backers to answer as fast as possible to any issue arises during the usage of the product. Our beta testers get even higher care to help the communication between our researchers and developers and our first users. Can I use any kind of Apple Watch model with SensDog?SensDog works with both Apple Watch generations and both editions, so you can use your old version in the collar, or buy an earlier version very cheap on the secondary market.Only the GPS capability is missing from the first version of Apple Watch (sometimes called edition 0) or the edition 1 of AppleWatch 2.0, all the others are exactly the same for SensDog. Most features of SensDog do not require the GPS and for the tracking of your walking and running with your dog your iPhone's GPS can be used as an approximate substitute, so this is not a serious limitation.You need an iPhone 5 or later model which could communicate with the Apple Watch.

<p>A tourbillon is a historic complication originally designed to improve the accuracy of pocket watches which was invented by the famous watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet in 1795. It is the term of a complex feature of traditional watch craftsmanship and present in a classic design of the high-end timepieces. For the purpose to let most of the watch-addicts can appreciate and enjoy for the tourbillon remarkable watch craftsmanship and complication, we used the most premium materials, reliable movement and unique design to create this authentic timepiece and also in a fraction of price to the Swiss mentors.   </p>

<p>Why we choose TY800? The calibre TY800 is a spectacular Mechanical Hand Winding Off-center Real Flying Tourbillon Movement made by Sea-Gull, the only 100% government-owned factory and the largest manufacturer of watch movements and Swiss movement parts in China.   </p>
<p>With a power reserve of about 40 hours, the mechanisms gleam with 19 jewels as it vibrates at 21,600 beats per hour. The TY800 utilizes a flying Tourbillon which differs from a conventional Tourbillon in that it relies on a cantilevered single support instead of a full bridge. The Tourbillon cage rotates 360 degrees every minute, with its tail capturing each second that passes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545538927/nuphfadz0mjyub0rhdk7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The caliber TY800 movement is delicately and skillfully hand crafted from over 100 finely crafted components, 70 of which comprise the most complicated part of the movement – the Balance Bridge. The front and back of the main plate are decorated with the Swiss “Perlage manuelle” and “Côte de Genève”, respectively.  </p>

<p>As mentioned previously, the caliber TY800 is a manual wind and not an automatic movement. There are two reasons for this. First, the rotor in an automatic movement would obstruct the visual of the carriage at the 6 o’clock position through the exhibition caseback. Second, a manual wind Tourbillon is thinner than its automatic counterpart, since the escapement would be in line with the balance wheel and without the rotor. </p>

THANKS EVERYONE!!          Please also stay tuned to our page for our upcoming new project As we have received many comments and feedbacks from Kickstarter that most of the backers are interested to the minutes track markings design instead of hours design. During the Indiegogo in-demand programme, all design will be upgraded to our backers' suggestion. We’re using the best materials and components to build an excessively quality and modern minimal design watches.  Links: Watchuseek, Watchinsider, Fratellowatches, WatchTime  We are offering directly via Indiegogo and Kickstarter, we are able to cut out the retail channel, middlemen markups, brand exclusivity/scarcity, and offer a US 499 real flying tourbillon watch with the most premium materials and modern minimal design watch. Seriously, try to find a better watch for a better price, and we’ll match it. 


Open Heart / Open Balance  
1. Only Display balance wheel spinning back and forth.  
2. The balance wheel, the lever and the escape wheel are all at fixed locations on the movement's base plate no counteract the effects of gravity  
3. Low complication and value 


Real Flying Tourbillon:  
1. Tourbillon is a device which spiral, pallet fork and the escapement were worked on the same axis, and rotating 360 degrees,  
2. Reduce the time difference error caused by gravity  
3. A high complication with hundreds of years traditional watch craftsmanship.
 

LENVINO Watch Co. was started in 2017 Jan, a group of watch-addicts with the passion and constancy of the traditional watch craftsmanship. We believe that the most timeless and desirable timepiece must be the traditional one. We would like to awaken people’s mind about the core function of a watch, thus create our brands. 

In 2017 Dec LENVINO Watch Co. launched its first Kickstarter campaign to fund the World’s First Minimalist Design Rectangular Tourbillon Watch. After 40 days on Kickstarter, it raised a total of HK$ 427,860. The result is the most backed tourbillon project on Kickstarter history. In 2018 April, we returns to Kickstarter to launch our second project “US$149 Japan Automatic Vintage Racing Watch”. After 30 days on Kickstarter, it raised a total of HKD 1,344,752. It was such a great success and surprise result for us.

With the success of the first two projects, we returns to Indiegogo and Kickstarter to launch our Third collection to you. 

“LENVINO” is inspired by Legend, Tradition and Innovation. We strive to create legendary timepieces by combining traditional craftsmanship and innovative design 
We are a group of watch-addicts who have already worked in the Hong Kong watch industry for over 28 years. We specialized in the design and manufacturing of high-quality quartz and automatic watches. We have established good relationships with the world’s leading watch manufacturers specializing in luxury watches for high-end brands that retail for over US$1,000, as well as renowned watch companies in the retail market with over 400 chain stores worldwide.

 

Our ambition is to create our very own brand, which we can share with watch enthusiasts around the globe.

We want to share our love for watches with you. But in order to do that, we need more than just having innovative and tradition designs, quality support from a world leading manufacturing partner, and 28 years of industry experience. Your support will be instrumental in helping us achieve our dream, and we are confident you will be impressed with the design, workmanship and value that our watches offer. 
 


A tourbillon is a historic complication originally designed to improve the accuracy of pocket watches which was invented by the famous watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet in 1795. It is the term of a complex feature of traditional watch craftsmanship and present in a classic design of the high-end timepieces. For the purpose to let most of the watch-addicts can appreciate and enjoy for the tourbillon remarkable watch craftsmanship and complication, we used the most premium materials, reliable movement and unique design to create this authentic timepiece and also in a fraction of price to the Swiss mentors.

<br/>The <span style=""color: forestgreen;"">We Care</span> Campaign</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While fashion is our first love, we understand that clothing production takes a toll on the environment and we want to do our part. As a responsible business, we strive to bring more sustainable, earth-friendly clothing into our collection. All items from the We Care collection are made from 100% recycled polyester. By choosing to wear clothing that is environmentally conscious, not only will you look amazing but also feel great knowing you’re contributing to a greater good.</p>

<h2>What is Recycled Polyester?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Recycled polyester is a synthetic fibre based on post-consumer waste, such as plastic bottles and used garments. The raw material is reprocessed and spun into fibres. Using recycled polyester helps us reduce our dependency on petroleum; allowing us to discharge less waste and reduce toxic emissions from incinerators.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That’s not ALL! The signature fabric for our jacket and pants is made from a unique blend of “Dope Dyed Yarn”.</p>

It takes about 20 gallons of water to produce one lot of fabric. So for every lot of fabric we make, we save 17 gallons of fresh water!<br/><br/> By using this material in our collection, we strive to keep plastic bottles out of landfills and conserve the use of fresh water. <br/></span></span></p>

<h2>Where Does the Money Go?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The cost of sustainable raw materials is much higher compared to non-sustainable materials due to the lack of demand from apparel companies. Therefore, fabric suppliers have little incentive to invest more of their resources into sustainable raw material product development. With your support, we can help challenge the status quo and increase the use of sustainable materials.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The money raised from the campaign will go towards meeting the very high minimums for taking these products into production. By increasing the volume of orders in the industry, we can contribute to the total demand for sustainable clothing which will lower the overall manufacturing cost (and therefore retail price). This will help make sustainable products more accessible to the mainstream market.</p>

<div class=""template asset"">Sheri killing it at her Crossfit workout, two weeks after her final treatment</div>
<p>As soon as I met Sheri I was a huge fan. Here was this kick ass woman- with no hair- laughing and talking about the last tough workout in her gym while having brunch at a friend’s house. After a friend asked about her hair situation, Sheri told us about her incredible journey of how she's worked through her breast cancer treatments one appointment and one workout at a time. It turns out that her bold and bald dome had invited many people to reach out with their own personal stories of cancer and treatment and solidarity.  This support- often from complete strangers in airports and grocery stores- turned out to be an essential part of Sheri’s healing process.</p>
<p>Our chance meeting lead into a treasured friendship and breast cancer walk team, and being the fashion design student I wanted our team to do better than the boring pink shirt that everyone else was wearing. We're athletes, not princesses, so it had to be fun, high-performance and sexy like us.  I got to work, and after weeks of iterations I created an original design that I hoped would represent the cause well and serve as a conversation starter to help people connect with others whose lives and loved ones have also been touched by cancer.  Since then I've heard dozens of meaningful stories- many from women I had just met- that have made me realize that cancer is all around us and needs a voice.  I hope you will help others share their own stories by boldly working out for a cause with us. </p>

<p><strong>Where your money goes</strong></p>
<p>We’re raising money because it takes a certain minimum number of units to manufacture these professionally. $5000 covers the essential production, materials, and shipping costs for this minimum order size, produced locally in a garment factory in San Francisco. Any money we raise that doesn't go towards producing the shirt will be given Sheri's Avon Walk for Breast Cancer fundraising challenge to support cancer research and women's health.  </p>
<p>And if we find that people are into what this is all about, we hope to continue to sell Rally gear for future breast cancer events and even expand to other causes and styles (including some for men too). By backing this project, you will be helping this women-owned, mission-driven company get off the ground with our first product, and will be contributing real dollars towards women's health via the Avon walk campaign.

<p>Athletics has long been a part of our lives but we are new to producing fashion en masse, so there may be unanticipated delays in the details of sourcing and production. We have already visited the production facility and have fabric choices lined up, which will help speed things along.</p>
<p>Also, colors may vary slightly from what you see here and are impossible to represent completely accurately with photos and different types of computer screens. Rest assured any fabric we use will be built for high-performance activity (ie no cotton) and we will do whatever we can to get as close to the colors shown as possible.</p>

It turns out that her bold and bald dome had invited many people to reach out with their own personal stories of cancer and treatment and solidarity.  This support- often from complete strangers in airports and grocery stores- turned out to be an essential part of Sheri’s healing process.
Our chance meeting lead into a treasured friendship and breast cancer walk team, and being the fashion design student I wanted our team to do better than the boring pink shirt that everyone else was wearing. We're athletes, not princesses, so it had to be fun, high-performance and sexy like us.  I got to work, and after weeks of iterations I created an original design that I hoped would represent the cause well and serve as a conversation starter to help people connect with others whose lives and loved ones have also been touched by cancer.  Since then I've heard dozens of meaningful stories- many from women I had just met- that have made me realize that cancer is all around us and needs a voice.  I hope you will help others share their own stories by boldly working out for a cause with us.

Where your money goes
We’re raising money because it takes a certain minimum number of units to manufacture these professionally. $5000 covers the essential production, materials, and shipping costs for this minimum order size, produced locally in a garment factory in San Francisco. Any money we raise that doesn't go towards producing the shirt will be given Sheri's Avon Walk for Breast Cancer fundraising challenge to support cancer research and women's health.  
And if we find that people are into what this is all about, we hope to continue to sell Rally gear for future breast cancer events and even expand to other causes and styles (including some for men too). By backing this project, you will be helping this women-owned, mission-driven company get off the ground with our first product, and will be contributing real dollars towards women's health via the Avon walk campaign. Thank you for checking us out!

Look at those baby guns! Thank you for checking out the project -Beth


 
Risks and challenges
Athletics has long been a part of our lives but we are new to producing fashion en masse, so there may be unanticipated delays in the details of sourcing and production. We have already visited the production facility and have fabric choices lined up, which will help speed things along.
Also, colors may vary slightly from what you see here and are impossible to represent completely accurately with photos and different types of computer screens. Rest assured any fabric we use will be built for high-performance activity (ie no cotton) and we will do whatever we can to get as close to the colors shown as possible.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

If you support us, our new scarves will finally come to life.</p>

<strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><br/> </h3><p><i><strong>Does the alert go directly to 911? </strong></i><br/>If you have the optional and free contact 9-1-1 feature enabled, when you double press your invisaWear, it will send an automated phone call to your emergency contacts prompting them to press 1 to connect via voice with 911 dispatchers near your location. The 911 dispatcher will be able to view your location on their screen.</p><p><i><strong>Is there a version for Men?</strong></i> <br/>Yes, there is a silver keychain that works for both men and women. Please select silver keychain at checkout for the unisex option. </p><p><i><strong>How do my contacts get notified?</strong></i><br/>Your emergency contacts will receive a text message letting them know you initiated an emergency alert and will receive a link with your GPS location. If you have the free and optional contact 911 feature enabled, your emergency contacts will be connected via a phone call with the nearest 911 dispatcher closest to you at the time of the emergency.</p><p><i><strong>Do I need to have my cell phone with me?</strong></i><br/>Yes. The invisaWear component uses a Bluetooth connection with a paired smartphone that can be up-to 30 feet away.</p><p><i><strong>Do I need to charge the battery?</strong></i><br/>No! We did not want to burden you with yet another accessory you have to remember to charge. The invisaWear component has a 1 year lifetime. After 1 year, we’ll send you a notification on the companion app to purchase a replacement component at a discount!</p><p><i><strong>What happens if I accidentally press the button?</strong></i><br/>For all you clumsies out there, no need to worry. invisaWear is designed just for you! A rapid double button press is required in order to initiate an alert. Additionally, the button actuation point is designed so that a substantial amount of pressure is required to press the button.</p><p>In the very rare case that you do accidentally activate an alert, that’s okay! Simply open your companion app within 30 seconds to notify your contacts &amp; the police that you’ve canceled the alert. A 911 dispatcher may need your verbal confirmation that you don’t actually need help.</p><p><strong><i>How do I select who gets notified in an emergency?</i></strong><br/>After purchasing an invisaWear, you simply install the free invisaWear Companion app onto your smartphone. The companion app allows you to select a group of up to 5 contacts who you would like to be notified during an emergency.</p><p><strong><i>Can I change my contacts at </i></strong><strong><i>anytime</i></strong><strong><i>?</i></strong><br/>Yes of course!

</ul></div>","invisaWear is attractive and smart jewelry which instantly sends your location to emergency dispatchers and loved ones during an emergency. We designed invisaWear to be discreet and to easily fit into your everyday life. The charm containing the technology is small, stylish and can be used in a variety of ways including a necklace, bracelet, choker, keychain, simply clipped to your bag or purse on any major brand of jewelry. We designed invisaWear to make pressing the device with one hand easy, but not so easy that you accidentally trigger an alert. We achieved this by precisely tuning the amount of pressure needed to activate invisaWear and using a two press system. We also included a battery life designed to last one year, so you don’t have to worry about remembering to charge another device. And, the Bluetooth technology inside allows you to contact help even if your smartphone is up to 30 feet away.invisaWear is perfect for anyone who wants to protect themselves or a loved one.invisaWear products are perfect for: invisaWear works with a companion app on your smartphone and it’s super easy to use. If you ever can't speak during an emergency, simply double click your device to send a text with your location to loved ones. The optional Contact 9-1-1 feature (available only in the US) can connect your loved ones to 9-1-1 to speak on your behalf and share your location.For more information, take a look at our CEO, Rajia, doing a demo of the invisaWear! 
This video below is an overview of how the app works and how to set it up!  

 

 

Major Update: invisaWear has now reached the manufacturing stage! We are well on our way to making the world a safer place. Check out the footage of invisaWear in production at this very moment!​

 

Rajia and Ray visiting our manufacturing partners
 

These lifesaving micro chips are ready to be placed in their 14K Gold plated outer shells.
 

The jewelry molds are already manufactured and ready for large volume production!
 
If you can speak during an emergency, we recommend using One Touch 9-1-1 in the app (rather than dialing 9-1-1 from your keypad) to call and send your precise location to 9-1-1 nearest to where you are. Using One Touch 9-1-1 has proven to show faster and more effective response times by 1 to 5 minutes.
The invisaWear founders testing with a local Public Safety Answering Point to see how the technology helps revolutionize the way 9-1-1 receives data. Our proprietary patent-pending technology powered by RapidSOS can share your name and location with any 9-1-1 dispatch center in the United States, even if you don’t know where you are. See how invisaWear compares to traditional personal security devices in the graphic below:The invisaWear team all came together because they had each faced concerns regarding their personal safety or the safety of people they love and care about.Our founder, Rajia, used to carry pepper spray while she was in college because she’d feel uncomfortable walking back to her car late at night. One day, a curious bystander picked up her pepper spray and attempted to press it. Worried that in an actual emergency the attacker would grab the pepper spray and try to use it against her, Rajia looked online to find a device that could allow her to quickly and discreetly alert her loved ones during an emergency. However, everything she found was big, bulky and unappealing to wear.Frustrated by the unbelievable statistics (1 in 4 college women are sexually assaulted before graduating college), Rajia and co-founder Ray felt morally obligated to use their engineering skills to create life-saving technology and embed it within fashionable items that people already love to wear. 
Frequently Asked Questions Does the alert go directly to 911? If you have the optional and free contact 9-1-1 feature enabled, when you double press your invisaWear, it will send an automated phone call to your emergency contacts prompting them to press 1 to connect via voice with 911 dispatchers near your location. The 911 dispatcher will be able to view your location on their screen.Is there a version for Men? Yes, there is a silver keychain that works for both men and women. Please select silver keychain at checkout for the unisex option. How do my contacts get notified?Your emergency contacts will receive a text message letting them know you initiated an emergency alert and will receive a link with your GPS location. If you have the free and optional contact 911 feature enabled, your emergency contacts will be connected via a phone call with the nearest 911 dispatcher closest to you at the time of the emergency.Do I need to have my cell phone with me?Yes. The invisaWear component uses a Bluetooth connection with a paired smartphone that can be up-to 30 feet away.Do I need to charge the battery?No! We did not want to burden you with yet another accessory you have to remember to charge. The invisaWear component has a 1 year lifetime. After 1 year, we’ll send you a notification on the companion app to purchase a replacement component at a discount!What happens if I accidentally press the button?For all you clumsies out there, no need to worry. invisaWear is designed just for you! A rapid double button press is required in order to initiate an alert. Additionally, the button actuation point is designed so that a substantial amount of pressure is required to press the button.In the very rare case that you do accidentally activate an alert, that’s okay! Simply open your companion app within 30 seconds to notify your contacts & the police that you’ve canceled the alert. A 911 dispatcher may need your verbal confirmation that you don’t actually need help.How do I select who gets notified in an emergency?After purchasing an invisaWear, you simply install the free invisaWear Companion app onto your smartphone. The companion app allows you to select a group of up to 5 contacts who you would like to be notified during an emergency.Can I change my contacts at anytime?Yes of course! Anytime you’d like to switch your emergency contacts, simply open the companion app to update your list.Are there any subscriptions or additional fees?Nope. No monthly payments are necessary. We want to make sure you always can get help without breaking the bank. Please note that message and data rates may apply.Please be aware that your invisaWear component has a battery designed to last one year and after the year is over, your invisaWear component will need to be replaced.

<p>We have implemented a Chrome browser extension as a first prototype. The extension encrypts Facebook chats by default (see video). We are initiating this campaign to finish development and enable GMail encryption and mobile usage on iPhone and Android smartphones.

<h1>How it works</h1>
<p><img alt=""System Diagram"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.blockprism.org/images/system.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Chrome browser extension enables encryption of Facebook messages and GMail emails with minimum interaction. Just install the extension and enter a passphrase, that’s all. The extension creates the necessary key pair in the background and shares the public key with your friends. Whenever you write a message, your friend’s public key is used to encrypt the message before it is sent. Received encrypted messages are decrypted with your private key in the background and shown. The extension will be ported to the Firefox and Opera browsers. Because most of the communication today is mobile, we want to create applications for your iPhone or Android too.</p>
<p><img alt=""Supported platforms"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.blockprism.org/images/platform.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>How can we ensure the encryption works?</h1>
<p>We use strong public private key encryption that is widely used (PGP) and proven. All code will be released as open source. Every programmer can see how it works and validate that the encryption is safe. We promise that the access to the applications will always be free. For advanced questions about encryption, have a look at our <a href=""http://blockprism.org/?page_id=22"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p style=""margin-top: 5px;"">All our knits are made using pure merino, alpaca and 100% cotton yarns. We need to be able to order lots and lots of our selected high quality yarns and accessories in bulk so that we stock them in competitive prices.</p>
<h4 style=""margin-bottom: 3px;"">Establish our production workflow and inventory platform</h4>
<p style=""margin-top: 5px;"">Our proposed business model that allows you to fully customize your garments (mass customization) requires a flexible yet clean-cut organized inventory platform and a production workflow that will allows us to knit-on-time℠ your unique garments without compromising the handmade quality of our products.

<p style=""margin-top: 5px;"">We need to design and develop an online platform for <a href=""http://www.plektronio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plektronio</a> that goes beyond a simple eshop. More than that, we want to design a platform that will enable you to fully customize your garments, taking part in the making process while we knit-for-you℠.

<h4 style=""margin-bottom: 3px;"">Fine-tune our business model</h4>
<p style=""margin-top: 5px;"">Making unique personalized items for everybody is not an easy task - this is why large companies avoid it.  It is actually a business and logistic nightmare. We would like to change this by developing an innovative yet robust and scalable model that can be sustainable throughout the lifecycle of our products. Our goal is to establish and benchmark our new services knit-on-time℠ and knit-for-you℠ while this campaign runs. This way we can accurately monitor your needs and preferences while under-the-hood we perform all the adjustments to assure the sustainability of our business.</p>

<hr style=""color: #1eb9c1;""/><h2 style=""margin-bottom: 3px;"">Plektronio's little tale</h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 5px;"">Contrary to the knitting tradition of many Greek families, I never sat next to my grandma to learn how to knit. But as I really love handmade garments, I started to experiment making my own. </p>
<p>During that time, one of my best friends was expecting her baby girl, Elli, and I was her impatient promised-to-be godmother. Looking for a unique and warm present for her upcoming birth, I knitted her first pair of crispy white <i>Mary Janes</i> with cute little wooden buttons. I simply fell for the handcrafting experience!</p>
<p>It was amazing how it became viral. I couldn't believe how much joy a pair of knitted shoes could bring. Very soon I realized that I could do this for all of my friends trying different designs, colors and embellishments matching their babies' personality. </p>
<p>And this is how my first collection of knitted baby shoes started.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/206173/files/20131118065244-first_collections-01.png?1384786364"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I spent the next year designing carefully my knitting campaign, ordering tons of patterns, stashing colorful yarns and mastering my knitting and crochet techniques. I started making various combinations of colors, embellishments and accessories rendering one single pattern into multiple unique items. Transforming this home-based hobby to an actual small business, came as a natural next step. <br/></p>
<hr style=""color: #1eb9c1;""/><h2 style=""margin-bottom: 3px;"">Now it is time to knit BIG!</h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 5px;"">Getting the encouragement and support from all our <a href=""http://www.plektronio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plektronio</a> friends who have loved our baby hand-knitted shoes, we decided that time has come to grow and knit also for you, your kids and your grown-up beloved ones.</p>
<p>And there is much more than that: We want to use our handcrafting skills to make unique and custom knitwear for every member of your family and friends letting you choose the design, the colors, the combinations and the matching accessories of your taste. </p>
<p>There is so much more in a handmade knit than the way it looks: there is warmth, love, tenderness and also effort for the person who has made it or selected it as a special gift for a special someone. Although unapologetically simple, wooly garments are carrying a beautiful heritage - and this is what makes them indefinitely valuable!</p>
<p>And this is what we truly value! To knit handmade, unique and fully personalized garments which will match your taste and last for many unique <a href=""http://www.plektronio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plektronio</a> outfits. </p>

<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 3px;"">Η μικρή ιστορία του plektronio</h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 5px;"">Παρόλα τα άπειρα πλεκτά της γιαγιάς μου που έχω φορέσει ως παιδί, ποτέ δεν κάθισα δίπλα της για να μάθω να πλέκω. Έχοντας, όμως, μια ιδιαίτερη αγάπη για τα χειροποίητα ρούχα, ξεκίνησα να πειραματίζομαι φτιάχνοντας τα δικά μου. </p>
<p>Εκείνη την περίοδο, περίμενα να γεννηθεί η μικρή μου βαφτιστήρα, Έλλη, και σαν ανυπόμονη νονά, ήθελα να της ετοιμάσω ένα ξεχωριστό δώρο. Έτσι της έπλεξα τα πρώτα της λευκά πλεκτά παπουτσάκια διακοσμημένα με μικρά ξύλινα κουμπιά. Ήταν πραγματικά μια ξεχωριστή εμπειρία!</p>
<p>Και αυτή ήταν μόνο η αρχή! Δεν μπορούσα να πιστέψω πόσα χαμόγελα μπορούσε να φέρει ένα ζευγάρι από μικρά πλεκτά παπουτσάκια. Σύντομα συνειδητοποίησα ότι μπορούσα να πλέκω για τα παιδιά ολοένα και περισσότερων φίλων μου, δοκιμάζοντας διαφορετικά σχέδια, χρώματα, αξεσουάρ που ταίριαζαν στο γούστο και στην προσωπικότητά τους. </p>
<p>Κάπως έτσι ξεκίνησε η πρώτη μου σειρά από πλεκτά βρεφικά παπουτσάκια.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/206173/files/20131118065244-first_collections-01.png?1384786364"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Πέρασα τον επόμενο χρόνο σχεδιάζοντας με προσοχή την παρουσίαση των πλεκτών μου, παραγγέλλοντας άπειρα πατρόν και πολύχρωμα νήματα και τελειοποιώντας τις τεχνικές μου στο πλέξιμο. Μετά  από λίγο καιρό, η έναρξη της μικρής μου επιχείρησης ήρθε σαν το επόμενο φυσικό βήμα. <br/></p>
<hr style=""color: #1eb9c1;""/><h2 style=""margin-bottom: 3px;"">Τώρα ήρθε η ώρα για να μεγαλώσουμε!</h2>

<p>Και δεν σταματάμε εδώ: Θέλουμε να χρησιμοποιήσουμε όλη μας την τέχνη στο πλέξιμο και να φτιάξουμε μοναδικά πλεκτά για εσάς, τα παιδιά και το σύντροφό σας, σχεδιασμένα και πλεγμένα όχι μόνο στα μέτρα σας αλλά και σύμφωνα με το σχέδιο, το χρώμα, τους συνδυασμούς και τα αξεσουάρ που εσείς θα διαλέξετε. </p>
<p>Αυτό έχει αξία για εμάς! Να πλέξουμε ρούχα και αξεσουάρ που είναι χειροποίητα, μοναδικά και προσαρμοσμένα στο δικό σας γούστο για πολλές ξεχωριστές εμφανίσεις. </p>

New perk for the whole family!Get ready for warm Christmas nights with matching slippers for all your family!



New perk!You and Mini-You <3Plektronio needs you to grow!
To do so, we need your contribution to make personalized knits for everybody. With each knit you are getting, you are helping us come closer to our goal.
Το plektronio σας χρειάζεται για να μεγαλώσει!
Για να το καταφέρουμε, χρειαζόμαστε τη συμβολή σας για να φτιάξουμε ξεχωριστά πλεκτά για όλους! Με κάθε πλεκτό που αποκτάτε, μας βοηθάτε να φτάσουμε πιο κοντά στο στόχο μας.

We need you to help us to…
Stash our high quality yarns
All our knits are made using pure merino, alpaca and 100% cotton yarns. We need to be able to order lots and lots of our selected high quality yarns and accessories in bulk so that we stock them in competitive prices.
Establish our production workflow and inventory platform
Our proposed business model that allows you to fully customize your garments (mass customization) requires a flexible yet clean-cut organized inventory platform and a production workflow that will allows us to knit-on-time℠ your unique garments without compromising the handmade quality of our products. For us it is really important to manage delivering your orders on time, so that you can wear and enjoy it for the whole season ahead!
Build a new online home for plektronio

We need to design and develop an online platform for plektronio that goes beyond a simple eshop. More than that, we want to design a platform that will enable you to fully customize your garments, taking part in the making process while we knit-for-you℠. This way, you can be creative by having full control over the final product by selecting its size, color combinations and matching accessories, while we do the knitting for you. In plektronio, we wish to make as unique garments as you are!
Fine-tune our business model
Making unique personalized items for everybody is not an easy task - this is why large companies avoid it.  It is actually a business and logistic nightmare. We would like to change this by developing an innovative yet robust and scalable model that can be sustainable throughout the lifecycle of our products. Our goal is to establish and benchmark our new services knit-on-time℠ and knit-for-you℠ while this campaign runs. This way we can accurately monitor your needs and preferences while under-the-hood we perform all the adjustments to assure the sustainability of our business.
Enhance our collection with clothing and special garments
We are piling up new knitting and crochet patterns that are waiting to be transformed into precious handmade apparels. As making unique garments involves unique designs we would like to engage designers around the globe that will make exclusive patterns for plektronio. We are so much looking forward to show you our future collections of heirloom lacy cardigans or hip hooded sweaters, perky dresses and pants as well as gloves, mittens, arm- and legwarmers and many (really many!) more!

Plektronio's little tale
Contrary to the knitting tradition of many Greek families, I never sat next to my grandma to learn how to knit. But as I really love handmade garments, I started to experiment making my own. 
During that time, one of my best friends was expecting her baby girl, Elli, and I was her impatient promised-to-be godmother. Looking for a unique and warm present for her upcoming birth, I knitted her first pair of crispy white Mary Janes with cute little wooden buttons. I simply fell for the handcrafting experience!
It was amazing how it became viral. I couldn't believe how much joy a pair of knitted shoes could bring. Very soon I realized that I could do this for all of my friends trying different designs, colors and embellishments matching their babies' personality. 
And this is how my first collection of knitted baby shoes started.

I spent the next year designing carefully my knitting campaign, ordering tons of patterns, stashing colorful yarns and mastering my knitting and crochet techniques. I started making various combinations of colors, embellishments and accessories rendering one single pattern into multiple unique items. Transforming this home-based hobby to an actual small business, came as a natural next step. 
Now it is time to knit BIG!
Getting the encouragement and support from all our plektronio friends who have loved our baby hand-knitted shoes, we decided that time has come to grow and knit also for you, your kids and your grown-up beloved ones.
And there is much more than that: We want to use our handcrafting skills to make unique and custom knitwear for every member of your family and friends letting you choose the design, the colors, the combinations and the matching accessories of your taste. 
There is so much more in a handmade knit than the way it looks: there is warmth, love, tenderness and also effort for the person who has made it or selected it as a special gift for a special someone. Although unapologetically simple, wooly garments are carrying a beautiful heritage - and this is what makes them indefinitely valuable!
And this is what we truly value! To knit handmade, unique and fully personalized garments which will match your taste and last for many unique plektronio outfits. 
You get to choose the design, the colors, the combinations and the matching accessories of your taste. What more can you get?

You get to choose in return any of our offered perks!
All our perks are offered in discount prices as long as our campaign last. Plus you get free shipping for all orders to Greece! Be sure to order on time to get all your Christmas & New Year's Eve presents from plektronio.
A pair of our newly introduced series of booties made exclusively with organic yarn
Our popular booties in toddlers and kids sizes!
Heads up! Our hats can be customized for boys or girls
A snuggly and versatile cowl for toddlers & kids
Yes, you and your older loved ones can have our knitted slippers too!
Handmade buttons or fluffy pom poms, you can embellish your hat any way you like!
Wrap yourself in our chic and warm cowls!

Steps for becoming a plektronio supporter:


take a look at our designs. (for more, check our gallery)


we would kindly ask you to add 5€ if ordering outside Greece


would you like to order more of our knits? even better! just fill in the sum of your order (or repeat the process)

Χρειαζόμαστε τη βοήθειά σας για να…
Προμηθευτούμε τις πρώτες ύλες για τα πλεκτά μας
Για τα πλεκτά μας χρησιμοποιούμε μόνο νήματα εξαιρετικής ποιότητας από μαλλί μερινό, αλπάκα και 100% βαμβάκι. Για να προμηθευτούμε τα υλικά αυτής της ποιότητας στην καλύτερη δυνατή τιμή, χρειάζεται να προχωρήσουμε σε παραγγελία χονδρικής και να εξασφαλίσουμε το συνδυασμό ποιότητας και κόστους.
Φτιάξουμε ένα καινούριο σπίτι για το plektronio

Φιλοδοξούμε να σχεδιάσουμε μια πρωτότυπη διαδικτυακή πλατφόρμα, ειδικά για το plektronio που δεν θα είναι απλά ένα ακόμα eshop. Στόχος μας είναι να αναπτύξουμε μια πλατφόρμα που θα σας επιτρέπει να σχεδιάσετε και να παραγγείλετε το πλεκτό σας ακριβώς όπως εσείς θέλετε, επιλέγοντας το μέγεθος, τους χρωματικούς συνδυασμούς και τα αξεσουάρ του. Με αυτόν τον τρόπο, θα δημιουργήσετε εσείς οι ίδιοι το δικό σας, μοναδικό πλεκτό, ενώ εμείς θα το ετοιμάζουμε για εσάς. Στο plektronio, θέλουμε να φτιάξουμε πλεκτά τόσο μοναδικά όσο εσείς!
Αναπτύξουμε το επιχειρηματικό μας μοντέλο
Η φιλοσοφία του επιχειρηματικού μας μοντέλου έχει στόχο να σας επιτρέπει να επιλέγετε εσείς οι ίδιοι όλες τις παραμέτρους που αφορούν τα πλεκτά σας. Για να μπορέσουμε να διαχειριστούμε τις παραγγελίες μας, συνδυάζοντας τη μοναδικότητα και ιδιαιτερότητα του χειροποίητου με την έγκαιρη παράδοση της παραγγελίας σας, χρειαζόμαστε το σχεδιασμό μιας εξειδικευμένης και ευέλικτης γραμμής παραγωγής. Είναι πολύ σημαντικό για εμάς να βελτιστοποιήσουμε την παραγγελία σας με τέτοιο τρόπο ώστε να είμαστε σε θέση να σας παραδώσουμε την παραγγελία σας εγκαίρως, ώστε να μπορείτε να φοράτε και να χαίρεστε τα πλεκτά σας για όλη τη σεζόν!
Εμπλουτίσουμε τη συλλογή μας με ρούχα και πλεκτά αντικείμενα
Στο εργαστήριό μας υπάρχουν δεκάδες καινούρια πατρόν που περιμένουν να μεταμορφωθούν σε υπέροχες πλεκτές δημιουργίες. Επειδή πιστεύουμε ότι τα ξεχωριστά πλεκτά ρούχα απαιτούν και ξεχωριστά σχέδια, θέλουμε να εμπλέξουμε σχεδιαστές από όλο τον κόσμο για να εμπνευστούν νέα σχέδια ειδικά για το plektronio. Ανυπομονούμε να σας δείξουμε τις επόμενες συλλογές μας με φορέματα, ζακέτες, γάντια, γκέτες και πολλά πολλά ακόμα!

Η μικρή ιστορία του plektronio
Παρόλα τα άπειρα πλεκτά της γιαγιάς μου που έχω φορέσει ως παιδί, ποτέ δεν κάθισα δίπλα της για να μάθω να πλέκω. Έχοντας, όμως, μια ιδιαίτερη αγάπη για τα χειροποίητα ρούχα, ξεκίνησα να πειραματίζομαι φτιάχνοντας τα δικά μου. 
Εκείνη την περίοδο, περίμενα να γεννηθεί η μικρή μου βαφτιστήρα, Έλλη, και σαν ανυπόμονη νονά, ήθελα να της ετοιμάσω ένα ξεχωριστό δώρο. Έτσι της έπλεξα τα πρώτα της λευκά πλεκτά παπουτσάκια διακοσμημένα με μικρά ξύλινα κουμπιά. Ήταν πραγματικά μια ξεχωριστή εμπειρία!
Και αυτή ήταν μόνο η αρχή! Δεν μπορούσα να πιστέψω πόσα χαμόγελα μπορούσε να φέρει ένα ζευγάρι από μικρά πλεκτά παπουτσάκια. Σύντομα συνειδητοποίησα ότι μπορούσα να πλέκω για τα παιδιά ολοένα και περισσότερων φίλων μου, δοκιμάζοντας διαφορετικά σχέδια, χρώματα, αξεσουάρ που ταίριαζαν στο γούστο και στην προσωπικότητά τους. 
Κάπως έτσι ξεκίνησε η πρώτη μου σειρά από πλεκτά βρεφικά παπουτσάκια.

Πέρασα τον επόμενο χρόνο σχεδιάζοντας με προσοχή την παρουσίαση των πλεκτών μου, παραγγέλλοντας άπειρα πατρόν και πολύχρωμα νήματα και τελειοποιώντας τις τεχνικές μου στο πλέξιμο. Μετά  από λίγο καιρό, η έναρξη της μικρής μου επιχείρησης ήρθε σαν το επόμενο φυσικό βήμα. 
Τώρα ήρθε η ώρα για να μεγαλώσουμε!
Με την ενθάρρυνση και υποστήριξη από όλους τους φίλους του plektronio οι οποίοι αγάπησαν τα χειροποίητα πλεκτά παπουτσάκια της συλλογής μας, αποφασίσαμε ότι έφτασε η ώρα να μεγαλώσουμε την επιχείρησή μας και να πλέξουμε και για εσάς, τα παιδιά σας και τους μεγαλύτερους αγαπημένους σας!
Και δεν σταματάμε εδώ: Θέλουμε να χρησιμοποιήσουμε όλη μας την τέχνη στο πλέξιμο και να φτιάξουμε μοναδικά πλεκτά για εσάς, τα παιδιά και το σύντροφό σας, σχεδιασμένα και πλεγμένα όχι μόνο στα μέτρα σας αλλά και σύμφωνα με το σχέδιο, το χρώμα, τους συνδυασμούς και τα αξεσουάρ που εσείς θα διαλέξετε. 
Αυτό έχει αξία για εμάς! Να πλέξουμε ρούχα και αξεσουάρ που είναι χειροποίητα, μοναδικά και προσαρμοσμένα στο δικό σας γούστο για πολλές ξεχωριστές εμφανίσεις. 

Μπορείτε να επιλέξετε ένα (ή και περισσότερα!) από τα πλεκτά μας!
Όλα τα πλεκτά προσφέρονται σε ειδικές τιμές για όλη τη διάρκεια της καμπάνιας μας. Ως ένα επιπλέον “ευχαριστώ”,αναλαμβάνουμε τα έξοδα αποστολής σας σε όλη την Ελλάδα! Συνεισφέρετε εγκαίρως για να παραλάβετε πριν από τις χριστουγεννιάτικες γιορτές όλα τα δώρα για τους αγαπημένους σας από το plektronio.

</div></div>","Click. Vintage Television Remotes. 
My
name is Patricia Harrison. My best friend in the world, Troy DeVolld, is a television producer for shows like Dancing With the Stars and dozens of others.  He loves making television and has spent
many many years collecting vintage television remotes just because he appreciated them for their unusual beauty.

Eventually
I decided that I wanted to take pictures of them ... for fun. I thought they
were cool, too. 
People were immediately intrigued! Many said, ""I grew up with
one of these remotes in my house!"" You may have, too.   
Troy
and I are really excited to publish and sell these books! We've also been asked
to do calendars, greeting cards, and art prints. 
We
found the expense of printing pretty surprising. It's not overwhelming. We
truly believe that ""you can not get what you don't ask for.""  We
need help.  
The
money will be going to printing costs, wholesale packaging, marketing, and
shipping costs.  When we have enough product, we plan to do art fairs
and will be selling on line. We have already started our inquiry letters
to retailers large and small.
It's
been our dream for many years to publish a coffee table book, but we never
found a subject that we dug equally. These are way cool, really beautiful and
-- sometimes -- just weird. 
We're seeking.. 
It's
very simple. We need a minimum of $15,000 to build inventory. 
We
need to hire finishing professionals to make sure that the products are done
correctly. From graphics to printing.  We are positive we will reach and
exceed our goal. However, If we do not reach our goal, the funds will be used
to print as many books as we can. We will wait to print calendars.
What YOU get! 
Your contribution
will be greatly appreciated!! BUT! since its better to give than receive ... We
want to give you gifts for helping out! These gifts will range from a set of
greeting cards to a 2015 calendar -- and for lots of lucky people, they will
get the finished coffee table book in a large size! 
Challenges.. yeah ok.. 
We
know that digital media is taking over. We understand that  maybe this
isn't a product that fills a techie's heart, but for those of you, like us, who
still love a book store, who still love to give a card, it's us that this
project is for.

Ways You Can Help!!

I am Cecil Norwood, jewelry artist extraordinaire and Firefly series fan. (Other fans might recognize the lingo in this campaign) I moved to Nashville to start my life over several years ago and have slowly rebuilt my shop.

<p>We all love our dogs, but let’s face it; we all dread the pickup
process during walks. Your dog conducts his/her business, people are watching,
judging, making sure you’re a responsible dog owner. You've had horrible
instances, experienced utter embarrassment and want to walk away whistling, but
know deep down inside you must be brave, put that hand in that little bag, and
go in for the scoop … Gross! Let the dry heaving begin. The frustrations kick
in and the sanitary questions begin to churn. Good news … I’ve invented a
solution!!</p>
<p>But before continuing, please allow me the opportunity to ask a
few questions to see if the Scoopette is for you, or someone you know, who’s
used the “hand in the bag technique”:</p>
<p><b><i>Have you experienced a “horror
story” or worried about bacterial intrusion (holes in the bag)?</i></b></p>

now slide them over the open blades and center the dispenser. Position the top
elastic in the provided grooves and under the attachment band and the bottom
elastic around the middle portion of the inside wall. This could be done with
or without the bags in the dispenser.  Unlike other dispenser's on the
market, our's acts like a “pouch,” is collapsible and expandable to fit an

ours!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/348575/files/20140204100419-Bag_Attachment_Sequence.jpg?1391537059"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Here is a quick tutorial

<p>I plan to add a couple more features to the Scoopette. One
addition is to include QR code's on the Attachment Bands that will link to a
“How to Use” tutorial video and my website. I also plan to add an additional
feature on the inside wall to accommodate the bottom elastic band of the
dispenser. I will also fix the logo a to be ""stand alone "" as well as
raise and silk screen printed, because I feel a colorful and well etched logo
is important.</p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>How’d you get the product this far?</b></h3>
<p>Trial and error is always a blessing in disguise. After building
the first prototype's, looking it over with fellow dog walkers and receiving
end user feedback, I saw there was more to the big picture then originally imagined. I began to see the ""frustrations"" with the process as a whole. These of course included
the sensation and bacterial intrusion elimination, but to my surprise tall
grass, concrete, loose stool, tiny hands, forgetting bags, convenient devise as
well as roll and unsanitary bag transport were at the top of the list. Until now,
there have been no products to alleviate these pain points and that is why it's
been great developing a device incorporating ""frustration""
eliminating features without overbearing additional steps.</p>
<p>I took the final prototypes to local dog parks, a couple
consumer trade shows and to Mom &amp; Pop shops to get their opinions and to
generate interest. I was overwhelmed with the amount of dog owners who loved it and encouraged me to continue with the efforts to bring it to market! Only then, did I know it
was a real winner!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/348680/files/20140204110346-Journey.jpg?1391540626"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>Early Concept's</b></h3>

I've designed and obsessed over every nuance of the device.

We all love our dogs, but let’s face it; we all dread the pickup
process during walks. Your dog conducts his/her business, people are watching,
judging, making sure you’re a responsible dog owner. You've had horrible
instances, experienced utter embarrassment and want to walk away whistling, but
know deep down inside you must be brave, put that hand in that little bag, and
go in for the scoop … Gross! Let the dry heaving begin. The frustrations kick
in and the sanitary questions begin to churn. Good news … I’ve invented a
solution!!
But before continuing, please allow me the opportunity to ask a
few questions to see if the Scoopette is for you, or someone you know, who’s
used the “hand in the bag technique”:
Have you experienced a “horror
story” or worried about bacterial intrusion (holes in the bag)?
Is your hand too small for a
one scoop and you find yourself “double dipping?” 
Do you refuse to walk your dog
with a back yard pooper scooper? 
Have you had issues with tall
grass or concrete?
Do you forget bags frequently?
Are you an expert in the
""swinging bag technique” walking to the trash?
Are
you frustrated when you see other’s ignoring the pickup process
all together?
If you've answered “YES” to one
or more of these questions, then the Scoopette is for you! The Patent Pending
Scoopette is designed specifically for the squeamish, the frustrated and the
already responsible! 
The Scoopette facilitates the
“hand in the bag technique” by:
Eliminating the overall
sensation as well as bacterial intrusion – Fantastic!
Potentially increasing the
length, width and depth of the human hand - No more ""double dipping!""
Instills confidence in you– No
more dry heaving or embarrassment!
Leash fastening capabilities -
Not “another thing” you're carrying!
Blade gaps when squeezed for
grass pull through – Ingenious!
Flush blade closure to assist
with messy concrete pick up – Finally!
An expandable dispenser (pouch)
for rolls so you’re not forgetting bags – How convenient!
A molded clip mechanism for
your unsanitary bag – No more “twirling” to the trash!
Share it  with your
friends or strangers who ignore the pick up – No more excuses people!
Use it to pick up a dead bird
or mouse! – Multi-Functional!The Scoopette is the ultimate dog walker’s clean up tool that
incorporates a minimalist design using magnets, friction blocks, hinges,
attachment bands, springs, rods and collapsible blades! The product delivers
satisfaction, cleanliness, ease and the feeling of responsibility everytime!
When collapsed and in the ""Transport"" Position, the
Scoopette shrinks into the size of a cell phone! When in the “Ready” Position,
it can double the size of the human hand!
How does it work?Device Transport The Scoopette is the only scooping device to fasten around a 2
ply leash. It is super light and is not inconvenient in any way. Securement is conducted through magnets and rubber friction blocks working
together. Simply align the leash atop the inside walls and close the
device around it! The Scoopette should remain sanitary and can be transported in a variety of ways in addition to the leash fastening capability, below are a few examples.
Leash TransportIN or ON Pocket (or Purse)Opening the Device
One Handed Technique:

The blades are locked in the ""Open / Ready"" Positions

you’re sliding into your pocket (or purse).Fasten, Clip and Go!
If you’re not
transporting the Scoopette in your pocket or purse, conveniently fasten it
around a 2 ply leash or onto your
pocket or purse! 
Now you still have that gross bag, what to do? Simply tie, hang,
or wedge it under the molded clip mechanism and go on your way hands free of
the creative twirling habits you involuntarily developed over the years! Old
habits die hard! Attaching the Dispenser
We all have some sort of dispenser that holds a roll of 30 bags,
but what about the Scoopette? No problem, I've created our own! Simply position
the dispenser with elastics upside down and wide at the tips of your fingers,
now slide them over the open blades and center the dispenser. Position the top
elastic in the provided grooves and under the attachment band and the bottom
elastic around the middle portion of the inside wall. This could be done with
or without the bags in the dispenser.  Unlike other dispenser's on the
market, our's acts like a “pouch,” is collapsible and expandable to fit an
array of roll sizes! Remember, our bags are pine scented and elongated at the
base (10” W) and will work with the majority of rolls out there, but best with
ours!Here is a quick tutorial

I plan to add a couple more features to the Scoopette. One
addition is to include QR code's on the Attachment Bands that will link to a
“How to Use” tutorial video and my website. I also plan to add an additional
feature on the inside wall to accommodate the bottom elastic band of the
dispenser. I will also fix the logo a to be ""stand alone "" as well as
raise and silk screen printed, because I feel a colorful and well etched logo
is important.

end user feedback, I saw there was more to the big picture then originally imagined. I began to see the ""frustrations"" with the process as a whole. These of course included
the sensation and bacterial intrusion elimination, but to my surprise tall
grass, concrete, loose stool, tiny hands, forgetting bags, convenient devise as
well as roll and unsanitary bag transport were at the top of the list. Until now,
there have been no products to alleviate these pain points and that is why it's
been great developing a device incorporating ""frustration""
eliminating features without overbearing additional steps.
I took the final prototypes to local dog parks, a couple
consumer trade shows and to Mom & Pop shops to get their opinions and to
generate interest. I was overwhelmed with the amount of dog owners who loved it and encouraged me to continue with the efforts to bring it to market! Only then, did I know it
was a real winner!Early Concept's
Our earliest of designs and prototypes left much room for
improvement. Once I understood the focus should be on eliminating the
frustrations rather than the sensation, magic began to happen!The Scoopette's Final DesignI will be using 4 color schemes demonstrated on top of page.Stretch GoalReward Tier Grid
Packaging Thoughts

Here are sketches of what I’m thinking. Please keep in mind the
Grass represents the backdrop or background effect, so try to imagine that
behind the product and accessories.
Estimates:
-Version A – 8”L x 4”W x 1.6”H
-Version B – 6” L x 6”W x 1.6”H
The options are to
package the accessories below or to the side of the device. The background
behind logo on top is TBD, but I’d like to stick with the idea “From the City
to the Prairie.” Perhaps I’ll make it a solid color. Recommendations can be
sent to info@scoopette.com. For the packaging, we’re including
the device, 1 roll of 30 bags (10""W), a dispenser ""pouch"" and a
carabier with elastic for you to enjoy!A)B)TimelineReward Artwork - ""Show Dogs""
In addition to the Scoopette's and Accessories, one of the
higher end rewards is a beautiful 8 x 10 acrylic painting of up to 1 dog on
wrapped canvas! Work directly with the artist to choose your own background!
Shipping Included!Reward Artwork - ""Best in Show""
In addition to the
Scoopette's and Accessories, the highest end
reward is an amazing20x24 ""Realistic""
/ ""Impressionistic"" portrait of up to 2 dogs (Size Incl. Frame)!!
Work directly with the artist who will allow you to use your imagination on
choosing a background! Shipping Included!Risks and challengesMy biggest worry is finding support for the project. Many people (or teams) worry about how to make a product, fulfill it, or design it, and in this case, I have figured out all of those logistics prior to launching.I am working with a terrific factory to generate the best possible Scoopette and accessorize the product to maximize its functionality. I've designed and obsessed over every nuance of the device. We're trying to build something that currently doesn't exist and we're excited, however, we realize that we might run into obstacles along the way. Overall, the Scoopette is a relatively simple product and project to manufacture and we anticipate hurdling obstacles and not project crushing road blocks.Luckily for me (and you) this isn't the factory's first rodeo in Pet Industry Product Production. These people do this sort of thing for a living and were highly recommended to see the Scoopette through fruition. I am confident we will be able to deliver on our promise. I also promise to be fully transparent and provide our supporters with regular updates as I move from concept to production to fulfillment.Mobilizing great fans, is probably my biggest issue and I’m looking for your help. Any great supporting tweets, videos, Facebook posts, they’re all a massive help. I plan on rewarding the biggest Scoopette supporters with significant recognition rewards, so please; your support will not go unnoticed!Thank You
The time, energy and effort building the Scoopette prototypes
has been fun! Between the shows and shops, I've met a lot of creative
and interesting people along the way, all of whom truly love their dogs! I
wish to thank the supporters at Pooch A Palooza, Pet Rock Fest, Attleboro
Animal Shelter, NE Pet Expo and the Portsmouth NH Expo, the supporters at
Stoddard’s Neck Park, the many shops who are willing to take on the
Scoopette, Rustic Hound www.rustichound.com, David Kaye www.kaye-nine.com, PetAge Magazine, Animal Wellness Magazine, Dollar Shave Club,
my friends who listen and provide direct and strategic advice (""The
Meindel's""), and my loving family who continue to support and make
sacrifices so I can chase a dream. This product and
project wouldn't have continued without you and for that, I’m
truly thankful. 
However, now is the moment of truth.
I hope I served you well my friends so … 
Be Good to Your Pet and Buy the Scoopette!

<p><strong>1. A Super Premium, Unisex sunglass made with materials that can brave the slips, falls, and accidents of everyday life</strong>. Made with a durable and flexible plastic frame, and polycarbonate scratch resistant lenses. It's lightweight, and can be carried anywhere. It'll become what your favourite sunglasses should be — long lasting and something that grows with you. <strong>  </strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Designed creatively with inspirations from childhood with a modern sensibility. </strong>Each pair of AEON Attire Sunnies represents a link between two different worlds. The Sunnies connect structure with beauty. Sharp lines and contours. Science and art. Old and young. What is and what is yet to be.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>3. <strong>A comfortable fit for the structure of the face and the sensitive nature of the skin</strong>. Our hypoallergenic frames are made from non toxic materials. They're nickel free, rust proof, and won't corrode/crack from sweat.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Respect for the windows to the soul. Formidable UVA &amp; UVB, and UV 400 protection for the eyes.</strong></p>
<p>5. <strong>Sold Direct and Crowdfunded</strong>. An answer to cheap knockoff frames and over priced brand inflated designer frames. Cheap quality frames aren't even worth spending money on. Premium glasses can cost $200+ in department stores. And that's without the gurantee, the leather case, and the microfiber pouch. We're scrapping the middle men and the ridiculous markups to keep the price low. After the campaign, this whole set will be retailing for $99 so you'll be saving over 60% when you support this project. </p>

<h2>This is where you come in!</h2>
<p>We need your help to go from working prototypes to full-scale production. We have been working with a leading manufacturer in frames and lenses that are hand assembled, polished, and packaged to our exact needs.</p>
<p>The funds raised from this project will be used to produce the AEON Sunnies Eyewear line, which includes 12 different eyewear styles, which utilizes metal for 6 of the designs. It will also help pay for the costs associated with a large scale production run, including the tooling, necessary molds, samples, and the creation of the cases and microfibre pouches. After the campaign is funded, we will quickly proceed to the creation of the Sunnies, quality control, and then mailing out your orders as soon as possible. </p>
<p><img alt=""rewards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/mvSknZO.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>By helping us make the AEON Sunnies, you'll get some Sunnies in return and be the first to wear them! Sunnies, shoutouts, meet and greets, customized dance sequences, hats, accessories... find it all below! </p>
<p>All reward levels over $30 include a limited edition Indiegogo microfiber pouch and hard-shell leather case for each pair of Sunnies + free shipping within Canada. If you are an international friend, please add $7 for shipping. At the end of the campaign, you will receive a survey where you specify the style of glasses you would like.  <br/><br/><img alt=""case"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/guodUGk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

 @AEONAttire!


1. A Super Premium, Unisex sunglass made with materials that can brave the slips, falls, and accidents of everyday life. Made with a durable and flexible plastic frame, and polycarbonate scratch resistant lenses. It's lightweight, and can be carried anywhere. It'll become what your favourite sunglasses should be — long lasting and something that grows with you.   
2. Designed creatively with inspirations from childhood with a modern sensibility. Each pair of AEON Attire Sunnies represents a link between two different worlds. The Sunnies connect structure with beauty. Sharp lines and contours. Science and art. Old and young. What is and what is yet to be.
 3. A comfortable fit for the structure of the face and the sensitive nature of the skin. Our hypoallergenic frames are made from non toxic materials. They're nickel free, rust proof, and won't corrode/crack from sweat.
4. Respect for the windows to the soul. Formidable UVA & UVB, and UV 400 protection for the eyes.
5. Sold Direct and Crowdfunded. An answer to cheap knockoff frames and over priced brand inflated designer frames. Cheap quality frames aren't even worth spending money on. Premium glasses can cost $200+ in department stores. And that's without the gurantee, the leather case, and the microfiber pouch. We're scrapping the middle men and the ridiculous markups to keep the price low. After the campaign, this whole set will be retailing for $99 so you'll be saving over 60% when you support this project. 
 *Conceived for the free thinker, the writer, the artist, the designer, the entrepreneur, the traveler, the student & the teacher, the old and the young. The passionate and the creative.






 

Go ahead, bend them. Modelled after the resilient and flexible nature of our youthful essence. Take life in stride.

The AEON Sunnies are inspired by the meeting of two worlds-- structure with beauty. Sharp lines and contours. Science and art. Old and young. What is and what is yet to be.

 You'll look amazing and feel safe. Crafted with UVA, UVB and UV400 protection. 

Sharp lines meet sweeping contours on the frame of the ""Neko"" style. 

Custom AEON Attire insignia can be found on every pair. Timeless and subtle.

Comes in it's very own house. Your choice of a smooth white leather (black or brown) case and an on-the-go microfibre pouch with a lens cloth. For the explorer and the collector. 
 

This is where you come in!
We need your help to go from working prototypes to full-scale production. We have been working with a leading manufacturer in frames and lenses that are hand assembled, polished, and packaged to our exact needs.
The funds raised from this project will be used to produce the AEON Sunnies Eyewear line, which includes 12 different eyewear styles, which utilizes metal for 6 of the designs. It will also help pay for the costs associated with a large scale production run, including the tooling, necessary molds, samples, and the creation of the cases and microfibre pouches. After the campaign is funded, we will quickly proceed to the creation of the Sunnies, quality control, and then mailing out your orders as soon as possible. 

By helping us make the AEON Sunnies, you'll get some Sunnies in return and be the first to wear them! Sunnies, shoutouts, meet and greets, customized dance sequences, hats, accessories... find it all below! 
All reward levels over $30 include a limited edition Indiegogo microfiber pouch and hard-shell leather case for each pair of Sunnies + free shipping within Canada. If you are an international friend, please add $7 for shipping. At the end of the campaign, you will receive a survey where you specify the style of glasses you would like.  
As a major thanks to everyone, all pledges above $35 gets you a complimentary thank you, a PERSONAL shout out to you, AND 3 customized dances by all members to a song of your CHOICE (YES ANY SONG). This will be posted on all our social media for your support as well as our campaign. Feel free to share our dedicated dance with all your friends, you're famous! 

(Luckily no singing)


$5: Shout Outs! A huge thank you, a follow on facebook, and an honorable mention. Every dollar makes a difference!


$20: Dance for your love! A fun way to support. You pick 3 songs and we dance to them. No questions asked. We'll be giving you a personal credit, thank you, and an honorable mention, and then the video will be uploaded onto our campaign & all our social media! Where you will become famous.

Make your pledge, receive fun and valuable rewards, share the story, and experience top-notch design and superior value. If we meet our goal, the collection comes to life!
-Wei, Wei & Patrick (AEON Attire)
 

The main challenge is awareness. We need to get the word out and build a buzz. We have asked friends, family, and bloggers worldwide to help us spread the word! If the campaign goes through, it's a huge step in helping break the sunglass market monopoly. 
Once the funding is in place, our next challenge will be to produce a large quantity of sunglasses at the quality and standard that we are looking for. We have a manufacturer with 20 years of sunglass experience, and we'll be working with them to produce the eyewear and get it into your hands.

Free your wrist! This pendant is lightweight and designed to lay flat when worn around your neck. We love how the 18K plating and stud accents brighten up your face for an instant glow. And when you hit your goal and the lights flash, it won't be your imagination that you're emitting a glow from within! The necklace is 20 inches long (shown on-figure in the photo above) and comes with a 4 inch extender for those who want a longer option. Note that the correct chain is the thinner style that is shown on the silver pendant. It's super light and comfortable at 0.9 ounces. This style is made in the USA.

<h4><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h4>
We are seeking $20,000 to fund tooling and rounds of samples for our Fitbit Flex accessories assortment. We've placed an initial order for many of these styles, so our first customers will receive their product in April! 
Almost all our styles feature windows that align with your tracker, so you can see the progress lights when you tap on the piece. Fun, right?! We've also designed these pieces so that your Fitbit Flex tracker will sit securely within the jewelry but be easy to insert and remove. And don't worry, you will feel and hear the rewarding buzz through our jewelry when you've hit your daily step goal!
Please note that the Fitbit Flex is NOT included in any of the styles. You can purchase the Flex separately.
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p>We have been very pleased with the quality of our samples but need to ensure quality is maintained for a larger production run. In particular, we want to ensure doors for the tracker open easily and that the tracker stays inside when we produce on a larger scale.</p>
<p>The other risk is how our jewelry wears over time. We have worked with the factory on a plating thickness that will hold up to our active customer's lifestyle, but we will continue to monitor as time goes on. We have been wearing our samples non-stop for the past month, and they are looking great so far!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We recommend that you wear Bezels &amp; Bytes styles for fashion and not intense physical activity (though we have tested them under such conditions and they hold up great!).</p>
<p>Don't forget! Our jewelry does NOT include the Fitbit Flex tracker. You can purchase the Flex separately <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Wireless-Activity-Sleep-Wristband/dp/B00BGO0Q9O"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>

<p>By funding this campaign (thank you!), you will not only launch our assortment for the Fitbit Flex, but also launch the Bezels &amp; Bytes brand. As women on the go, we need technology at our fingertips to get things checked off our lists and to multi-task. Our vision is to create tech-friendly fashion and accessories, so you can stay connected while looking polished and put together.</p>

<p>Melissa was a marketer at Gap, and Sarah was a buyer at Bloomingdale's. We live and breathe retail and fashion. We left big companies with dreams to build a fashion brand and realized we need to update the way we dress to accommodate our modern, tech-enhanced lives. We would love to have you join us on this journey!</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><b>What is your return policy?</b></p>
<p>We want you to be absolutely delighted with the product you receive and be rewarded for taking a chance on our new company. If you are not satisfied within 10 days of receiving the product, simply email us and we will find a solution.</p>
<p><b>Where is your jewelry manufactured?</b></p>
<p>We are testing factories and currently working with two in the USA and one in Asia.</p>
<p><b>Will my tracker be accurate in the jewelry?</b></p>
<p>We have worn trackers in our jewelry alongside trackers in the rubber bracelet, and the results are almost identical. Just like when wearing the Fitbit tracker, steps vary person to person and with various activities. Note that for the necklace, we designed it to lay flat when walking; If you are active to the point your necklace is jumping up and down, accuracy will likely be compromised.</p>

Includes free US shipping. 





The stud double wrap bracelet is an eye-catcher. We think you'll love how this bracelet, with its 12K gold studs, black leather band, and your Fitbit inside, will make every step just a bit bolder!  The leather band wraps twice around your wrist and has a double snap closure to make it extra comfortable.  The interior circumference is 13.5"" long with 2 snaps closed or 14.25"" long with 1 snap closed.  It's lightweight at 1.4 ounces.





Basketweave Single Wrap Bracelet, $78  


Includes free US shipping.


We love the combination of the classic basketweave next to the modern black leather band and 12K gold plating, making this style feel fresh and polished. The leather band wraps around once for those who like a slim profile, and it's comfortable to wear with its double snap closure. (Please note that some photos show a double wrap leather bracelet, but the final product will be a single wrap leather bracelet.)  The interior circumference is 7.4"" long with 2 snaps closed or 7.8"" long with 1 snap closed. It's lightweight at 1.2 ounces.



Stud Pendant Necklace in Gold or Silver, $88


Includes free US shipping.




Free your wrist! This pendant is lightweight and designed to lay flat when worn around your neck. We love how the 18K plating and stud accents brighten up your face for an instant glow. And when you hit your goal and the lights flash, it won't be your imagination that you're emitting a glow from within! The necklace is 20 inches long (shown on-figure in the photo above) and comes with a 4 inch extender for those who want a longer option. Note that the correct chain is the thinner style that is shown on the silver pendant. It's super light and comfortable at 0.9 ounces. This style is made in the USA.





New Style! Single stud earring, $25

Includes free US shipping.


Pull your entire look together with a single pyramid earring.  This goes perfectly with all our pieces and is a wonderful update to the basic stud earring.  It's made of brass and plated in 12K gold.

Triple Stud Earring, $25

Includes free US shipping.



This piece goes with all our jewelry and will pull your look together. We love this earring because it's basic enough for everyday, but the studs add just the right amount of edge. The earrings are imported and plated in 12K gold.


Other newly added perks:
1) Can't decide between two styles or want to give Bezels & Bytes for Valentine's Day or Mother's Day?  Save $10 by purchasing the specific ""Add On"" perk after your first bracelet or necklace purchase. 
2) Add any of our earrings for $10 (regularly $25).  Purchase the ""Add On: Earring"" perk. We will confirm your Single or Triple Stud choice at the end of the campaign.

What We Need & What You Get
We are seeking $20,000 to fund tooling and rounds of samples for our Fitbit Flex accessories assortment. We've placed an initial order for many of these styles, so our first customers will receive their product in April! 
Almost all our styles feature windows that align with your tracker, so you can see the progress lights when you tap on the piece. Fun, right?! We've also designed these pieces so that your Fitbit Flex tracker will sit securely within the jewelry but be easy to insert and remove. And don't worry, you will feel and hear the rewarding buzz through our jewelry when you've hit your daily step goal!
Please note that the Fitbit Flex is NOT included in any of the styles. You can purchase the Flex separately.

Risks & Challenges

We have been very pleased with the quality of our samples but need to ensure quality is maintained for a larger production run. In particular, we want to ensure doors for the tracker open easily and that the tracker stays inside when we produce on a larger scale.
The other risk is how our jewelry wears over time. We have worked with the factory on a plating thickness that will hold up to our active customer's lifestyle, but we will continue to monitor as time goes on. We have been wearing our samples non-stop for the past month, and they are looking great so far!

We recommend that you wear Bezels & Bytes styles for fashion and not intense physical activity (though we have tested them under such conditions and they hold up great!).
Don't forget! Our jewelry does NOT include the Fitbit Flex tracker. You can purchase the Flex separately here. 

Our brand: Bezels & Bytes






By funding this campaign (thank you!), you will not only launch our assortment for the Fitbit Flex, but also launch the Bezels & Bytes brand. As women on the go, we need technology at our fingertips to get things checked off our lists and to multi-task. Our vision is to create tech-friendly fashion and accessories, so you can stay connected while looking polished and put together.


Melissa was a marketer at Gap, and Sarah was a buyer at Bloomingdale's. We live and breathe retail and fashion. We left big companies with dreams to build a fashion brand and realized we need to update the way we dress to accommodate our modern, tech-enhanced lives. We would love to have you join us on this journey!
FAQ
What is your return policy?
We want you to be absolutely delighted with the product you receive and be rewarded for taking a chance on our new company. If you are not satisfied within 10 days of receiving the product, simply email us and we will find a solution.
Where is your jewelry manufactured?
We are testing factories and currently working with two in the USA and one in Asia.
Will my tracker be accurate in the jewelry?
We have worn trackers in our jewelry alongside trackers in the rubber bracelet, and the results are almost identical. Just like when wearing the Fitbit tracker, steps vary person to person and with various activities. Note that for the necklace, we designed it to lay flat when walking; If you are active to the point your necklace is jumping up and down, accuracy will likely be compromised.

<p>DormMate is an inventive bag unlike any other on the shelves these days. It is a roll-up toiletry bag that holds everything from your toothbrush to your shaving gel. <strong>Simply put, it is your personal countertop.</strong></p>
<p>DormMate is designed to protect germ-fearing students from the millions of bacteria on a dorm bathroom countertop. When rolled out DormMate fits perfectly between sinks (we tested it on the smallest of spaces). Once rolled up, <strong>DormMate has space efficiency written all over it</strong>. The handle fits on any doorknob, while it is small enough to be stored on a shelf or under a bed.</p>
<p>We are past the prototyping phase and are into production but here is where we need you.</p>
<p><strong>So here's the plan.</strong></p>
<p>With the money raised on indiegogo, we will do three things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place an order for 1,000 DormMates</li>
<li>Market DormMate at college campuses. </li>
<li>Plant some trees!</li>
</ul><p>After proving sales in big college markets this fall, DormMate will be ready to go to distributors like Bed Bath and Beyond and Target who are the biggest players in a college market estimated to be worth 4 billion dollars. </p>
<p>We will run T.V informercials by next summer and target other markets that we missed in the 2012 school year. </p>

<h1>Is DormMate just for students?</h1>
<p>No way! It is the perfect bag for travelers, painters, bikers, outdoor enthusiasts  and just about everyone else. We originally designed DormMate for students but found that the majority of people wanted to use it for more than just their dorm. </p>
<h1><strong>The future of DormMate.</strong></h1>
<p>Once we establish the DormMate name on campuses around the United States, we plan to do three things. </p>
<p><strong>-Tap into the growing international college market.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Set up an online store, to optimize the traffic that our website         (<a href=""http://www.dormmate.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dormmate.co</a>) would otherwise waste selling one dorm accessory. </strong></p>
<p>-<strong>Invent more dorm products</strong></p>
<p>These actions will boost our sales into the millions and further establish DormMate as a household name, or should we say dormhold name.</p>
<h1>Can I buy a DormMate right now?</h1>
<p>Yes. We placed a small order of 100 that will be shipping in early August. If your school starts earlier than most, or you just can't wait to get your hands on a DormMate shoot us an email at dormmate@gmail.com</p>
<h1>Who are we? </h1>
<p><strong>In short:</strong> We are a couple of college students starting a company with good morale values that hopes to give back to the earth. </p>
<p><strong>In detail: </strong> We are the inventors of DormMate. If you've ever been in a college dorm bathroom, you know why we invented this product. DormMate is a roll-up toiletry bag that becomes a pallet for your toothbrush, razor, hairbrush etc. that we invented for ourselves.</p>
<p>Connor Clarry and I (Michael Thomas) will be attending Cal Poly and The University of British Columbia respectively in the fall. We realized that there are a whole lot of ""hoodies"" running the world these days. What I mean by this is that <strong>you no longer have to be 50 years old and balding to start the next greatest company. </strong></p>
<p>By contributing to DormMate, you are not only helping us. You are helping the world. We don't mean the occasional student you may save from bacteria. DormMate is a company that hopes to give more than we take from the beautiful Earth we live on. </p>
<p>We'll admit, we've hugged a tree or two in our lives. It's hard not to look at the world we live in and feel a complex emotion of love and hate. Love, for the beautiful products we use everyday. But hate, for the destruction these products cause. </p>
<p>This is our mission to be one of the world's businesses of tomorrow. We hope to lead by example and show our generation just how easy it is to give a little back to Mother Nature.

<p><strong>Sounds like you’ve got it together, why do you need Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>Pulling together all the elements for a first season launch costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time from talented people. This especially applies to denim, which is highly specialized and needs the loving care of long established factories and wash-houses (for that owned-it-a-million-years look), which are available to us in LA. All of the R+D is done in the Toronto studio, we’re damn good, but there is only so far we can take our home-grown samples without this serious and essential machinery.</p>
<p>We need that final set of top-notch samples for when we start the process of getting shop orders and building a stockist list. That means taking the product on the road in January to Capsule Trade Show in NYC, where we can meet and show the product to store buyers. When we do this we need to have great looking promotional materials, a ballin’ website and a whole ‘lotta logistics sorted out! </p>
<p>In a nutshell, your Indiegogo donation will go towards: </p>
<ul>
<li>Developing and making the “Golden Seal” samples of each style in our Denim line-up, one for sales and one for press. <em>(Golden Seal is industry terminology for the final, perfect sample that we will present to buyers, and on which production is based). </em>For each style our developer in Los Angeles has to go through 3 edits, with changes on the fabric composition, the cut and the wash. This is by far the biggest cost, but once we nail down the fits on our 6 styles, we can use those fits as a base season after season. It is a key investment to the longevity of the brand. <strong>Cost: $14, 506</strong>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Developing and making the golden seal samples for our printed shirting range. This includes the weighty cost of digitally printing short yardages of fabric (later when we print for production the cost goes down dramatically), excellent patternmaking, and craftsmanship in the home of tailoring – the United Kingdom. <strong>Cost: $4076</strong>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Developing and making the golden seal samples for our premium sweatshirts. Everything to do with the sweatshirts happens at home in Toronto, where local talent make the final pieces. <strong>Cost:</strong> <strong>$2313</strong>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Registering for trade shows, and then getting the product there. This includes the show fee, flights, shipping, the cheapest food and accommodation we can find, and the <em>really</em> exciting stuff like order forms and sales books (harhar). There are great shows in Europe and all over the world, but for this first season we are aiming a little closer to home, Capsule Trade Show in NYC, January 2013. <strong>Cost: $4550</strong>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Studio Rent. <strong>Cost:</strong> <strong>$3000</strong>
</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>This is a relatively condensed explanation of our budget. If you are interested in investing and are curious about a more detailed breakdown, we’d love to hear from you, and can send you some further information.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Right, I get it, pretty cool! So if I donate I get prizes right?</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever! The seductive prize breakdown looks can be seen to the side, and we will be updating with pics so you can see exactly what you are getting!<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m pretty convinced and threw down $300. When do I actually get my jeans?</strong></p>
<p>We are aiming for June delivery. If we can get the product out to you earlier we certainly will! That’s fashion though folks, she takes bloody ages.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Last thing: I looked into wash houses and they can be pretty notorious for polluting/water use, what’s the deal?</strong></p>
<p>We looked into that too, and as a result we are using reduced water consumption methods, and more modern, less damaging techniques. BAZZUL might not be branded as ‘green’ but sustainability is at our bottom line, and all the processes we use are always the most eco-responsible option. For example, we are eliminating unnecessary packaging material, tags and cards, opting to print any vital information directly to the garment.</p>

(Golden Seal is industry terminology for the final, perfect sample that we will present to buyers, and on which production is based). For each style our developer in Los Angeles has to go through 3 edits, with changes on the fabric composition, the cut and the wash. This is by far the biggest cost, but once we nail down the fits on our 6 styles, we can use those fits as a base season after season. It is a key investment to the longevity of the brand. Cost: $14, 506


Developing and making the golden seal samples for our printed shirting range. This includes the weighty cost of digitally printing short yardages of fabric (later when we print for production the cost goes down dramatically), excellent patternmaking, and craftsmanship in the home of tailoring – the United Kingdom. Cost: $4076


Developing and making the golden seal samples for our premium sweatshirts. Everything to do with the sweatshirts happens at home in Toronto, where local talent make the final pieces. Cost: $2313


Registering for trade shows, and then getting the product there. This includes the show fee, flights, shipping, the cheapest food and accommodation we can find, and the really exciting stuff like order forms and sales books (harhar). There are great shows in Europe and all over the world, but for this first season we are aiming a little closer to home, Capsule Trade Show in NYC, January 2013. Cost: $4550


Studio Rent. Cost: $3000

 
This is a relatively condensed explanation of our budget. If you are interested in investing and are curious about a more detailed breakdown, we’d love to hear from you, and can send you some further information. 
Right, I get it, pretty cool! So if I donate I get prizes right?
Do you ever! The seductive prize breakdown looks can be seen to the side, and we will be updating with pics so you can see exactly what you are getting! 
I’m pretty convinced and threw down $300. When do I actually get my jeans?
We are aiming for June delivery. If we can get the product out to you earlier we certainly will! That’s fashion though folks, she takes bloody ages. 
Last thing: I looked into wash houses and they can be pretty notorious for polluting/water use, what’s the deal?
We looked into that too, and as a result we are using reduced water consumption methods, and more modern, less damaging techniques. BAZZUL might not be branded as ‘green’ but sustainability is at our bottom line, and all the processes we use are always the most eco-responsible option. For example, we are eliminating unnecessary packaging material, tags and cards, opting to print any vital information directly to the garment.

<div>Hi Indiegogo funders, I am Jase King and I've been photographing the world and its diverse cultures and peculiarities across over 79 countries and almost 200 cities. Over a period of 10 years, I have captured over 250,000 images of the world we all call home. I carefully select and manipulate the photographed image, to create one of a kind prints and fabrics used for the production of clothes, accessories and home wares.The unique statement pieces form this Visionary Clothing and lifestyle brand named, VIAGGI BY JASE KING.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">""Viaggi"" is Italian for ""Travels"". The beautiful sound of this language is translated into the phonetics of the word, evoking elegance and sophistication. It is by no coincidence that the images are imagined while galavanting the globe. A unique collaboration between wanderlust and fashion. </span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>Inspired and created on a voyage of exploration.</i> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Viaggi by Jase King's expert craftsmanship bridges the gap between sharp tailoring, fashion innovation and the love of the world. </span>
</div>
<div><i><b>Selection Of Premium Fabrics...</b></i></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Wear us on a flight or pack us into your suitcase. Each piece is well thought out from conception to the tailoring of the final garments. We first begin by selecting tested fabrics that are travel ready ( we even took the samples on a spin ourselves wearing our jackets and pants while flying). They are items you can wear, pack and remove out of your luggage with minimum fuss without the worry of an ironing board at the hotel. We believe in luxurious fabrics and attention to detail. There is absolutely no reason why dressing fashion forward can't be comfortable. </span></div>

<i style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Immortalizing That Moment Into Wearable Art...</b></i><br/>
</div>
<div>Here is an image I photographed while traveling across the wilderness of Tibet from Kathmandu to Lhasa.  Altitude sickness of the brain hit me shortly after this was captured. I won't get your pledges for that, but I hope you believe in my vision. There is a story behind every image. An emotion that ignites from within. The magical spark of that instant, that could be lost with a blink of an eye. This brand is the translation of that precise moment into wearable garments. All the photographs are captured by me, therefore when you wear one of the signature pieces, you know you are wearing something that can't be bought just anywhere. It's unique. It's an experience. It's art. It's an emotion. A slice of originality. Visionary clothing. </div>
<div>

<p></p>
<p><i><b>The Design And Making Of...</b></i></p>
<p>After we marry the chosen imagery and material choice, we begin the printing process where our designs are constructed from. One of our statement pieces, The Tibetan Flag Jacket is the unlikely pairing of the tuxedo jacket, known for its strict dress code with the merging of the vivacious print of the Tibetan flags. You will make a lasting impression no matter the occasion. </p>

</div>
<div>I don't wish the finality of my work to be just a book of photographs of the world. That has already been done. Should I do it in the future, it has to portray how I have used my photography to create and innovate. It must give back to the world, which has inspired me to the core of my being. While photographing these images, I've encountered the less fortunate. As I take a portrait of them, I ask them about their lives and I always wonder, what I can do to help? How can I help them through what I love to do? Then it came to me through an old man, with an answer that I've heard so many times before but only became clear to me right there. He said "" You can help me by buying my bracelets. I support my family through what I make and sell"". So it's important to me Viaggi takes flight. We can support their livelihood by buying what they make, through a dedicated category on Viaggi's online retail website where more people can purchase them. </div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">VIAGGIBYJASEKING is the continuation of creation and exploration, combining Photography and Fashion in a fresh and unexpected way while giving back to the source of the Inspiration. </span>
</div>
<div>The final product of each piece comes from an immeasurable amount of time and money capturing the photos around world. My images are fashioned into the birthing of the fabric prints and the garment are then thoughtfully designed into wearable art, statement pieces. It's a long process that encompasses the final product that you will wear. This campaign has been created to raise funds so I can start producing these clothes and home wares to be sold online at <a href=""http://www.viaggibyjaseking.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.viaggibyjaseking.com</a>. I aspire to get the accessories and home wares into shops everywhere and to open its own signature boutique with like minded investors.

<h4><b>I LOVE IT! CAN GIRLS WEAR IT?!</b></h4>
</div>
<div>A most affirmative astounding YES! We are excited to strive in creating a brand that appeals and caters to both men and women alike. Fashion shouldn't be exclusive or specific to gender types. Everyone should have the freedom to wear whatever they choose. We don't discriminate! You can wear any of these items and pair it up with heels and rock it! In fact through our focus groups conducted, ALL the girls said they would want to own them. The cut of clothes and shoulder pads of the jackets makes them feel empowered. In time we will also design and create edgy prints for dresses. </div>

</div></div>","Hi Indiegogo funders, I am Jase King and I've been photographing the world and its diverse cultures and peculiarities across over 79 countries and almost 200 cities. Over a period of 10 years, I have captured over 250,000 images of the world we all call home. I carefully select and manipulate the photographed image, to create one of a kind prints and fabrics used for the production of clothes, accessories and home wares.The unique statement pieces form this Visionary Clothing and lifestyle brand named, VIAGGI BY JASE KING.
""Viaggi"" is Italian for ""Travels"". The beautiful sound of this language is translated into the phonetics of the word, evoking elegance and sophistication. It is by no coincidence that the images are imagined while galavanting the globe. A unique collaboration between wanderlust and fashion. 

Inspired and created on a voyage of exploration. Viaggi by Jase King's expert craftsmanship bridges the gap between sharp tailoring, fashion innovation and the love of the world. 

Selection Of Premium Fabrics...
Wear us on a flight or pack us into your suitcase. Each piece is well thought out from conception to the tailoring of the final garments. We first begin by selecting tested fabrics that are travel ready ( we even took the samples on a spin ourselves wearing our jackets and pants while flying). They are items you can wear, pack and remove out of your luggage with minimum fuss without the worry of an ironing board at the hotel. We believe in luxurious fabrics and attention to detail. There is absolutely no reason why dressing fashion forward can't be comfortable. 


Immortalizing That Moment Into Wearable Art...

Here is an image I photographed while traveling across the wilderness of Tibet from Kathmandu to Lhasa.  Altitude sickness of the brain hit me shortly after this was captured. I won't get your pledges for that, but I hope you believe in my vision. There is a story behind every image. An emotion that ignites from within. The magical spark of that instant, that could be lost with a blink of an eye. This brand is the translation of that precise moment into wearable garments. All the photographs are captured by me, therefore when you wear one of the signature pieces, you know you are wearing something that can't be bought just anywhere. It's unique. It's an experience. It's art. It's an emotion. A slice of originality. Visionary clothing. 



The Design And Making Of...
After we marry the chosen imagery and material choice, we begin the printing process where our designs are constructed from. One of our statement pieces, The Tibetan Flag Jacket is the unlikely pairing of the tuxedo jacket, known for its strict dress code with the merging of the vivacious print of the Tibetan flags. You will make a lasting impression no matter the occasion. 
We understand the importance of fit and tailoring as every individual is unique. We customize the jackets, shirts and pants to your measurements. Let's celebrate all body types!
Each of our garments are designed to be ""WOW"" pieces. That is our signature. No one else in the market is creating garments this way and we plan to be the first with your help and pledges. 


WHAT IS THIS CAMPAIGN AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. WHY DONT YOU PUBLISH A COFFEE TABLE BOOK AND CALL IT A DAY?

I don't wish the finality of my work to be just a book of photographs of the world. That has already been done. Should I do it in the future, it has to portray how I have used my photography to create and innovate. It must give back to the world, which has inspired me to the core of my being. While photographing these images, I've encountered the less fortunate. As I take a portrait of them, I ask them about their lives and I always wonder, what I can do to help? How can I help them through what I love to do? Then it came to me through an old man, with an answer that I've heard so many times before but only became clear to me right there. He said "" You can help me by buying my bracelets. I support my family through what I make and sell"". So it's important to me Viaggi takes flight. We can support their livelihood by buying what they make, through a dedicated category on Viaggi's online retail website where more people can purchase them. 

VIAGGIBYJASEKING is the continuation of creation and exploration, combining Photography and Fashion in a fresh and unexpected way while giving back to the source of the Inspiration. 

The final product of each piece comes from an immeasurable amount of time and money capturing the photos around world. My images are fashioned into the birthing of the fabric prints and the garment are then thoughtfully designed into wearable art, statement pieces. It's a long process that encompasses the final product that you will wear. This campaign has been created to raise funds so I can start producing these clothes and home wares to be sold online at www.viaggibyjaseking.com. I aspire to get the accessories and home wares into shops everywhere and to open its own signature boutique with like minded investors. Every dollar you pledge matters! 
Here are other wearable art pieces.  


Made from 100% linen in matching jacket and shorts. It's comfortable and chic. Can you tell where this is? 


Custom made featuring The Howl Series. Velvet Jacket, Waistcoat and Untied bow tie. 


ARE THESE ORIGINAL IMAGES THAT YOU ARE USING? 
Yes of course. My work has been exhibited, featured in 2 page spreads in magazines and newspapers around the world. Some of my repertoire of images can be found at

www.JaseKing.com 



Before ViaggiByJaseKing was founded, I've blogged several years as a photographer and contains a significant amount of photos.

I LOVE IT! CAN GIRLS WEAR IT?!

A most affirmative astounding YES! We are excited to strive in creating a brand that appeals and caters to both men and women alike. Fashion shouldn't be exclusive or specific to gender types. Everyone should have the freedom to wear whatever they choose. We don't discriminate! You can wear any of these items and pair it up with heels and rock it! In fact through our focus groups conducted, ALL the girls said they would want to own them. The cut of clothes and shoulder pads of the jackets makes them feel empowered. In time we will also design and create edgy prints for dresses. 
Posted on Instagram, look what the fashion editor of Shanghai's prominent fashion and lifestyle magazine ""That's It"", is wearing!                                                

DO YOU ONLY MAKE PRINTED GARMENTS AND HOME WARES?

We produce other garments that can be worn with the signature pieces. While they look immaculate accompanying the prints, each of them are fashionable in their own right. There always has to be something special about each piece. Some of the pieces are featured at the perks section. 





We believe in bringing people together, in line with our vision at Viaggi By Jase King. Our online store, that ships worldwide, we will have a page titled BAZAAR, where we support local artisans from the world and their livelihood by giving them a platform to sell their wares. This will be an on going commitment where you will be able to buy unique pieces from around the globe on our site. One of the items that is available as a perk, is the Anchor Rope Bracelet, handmade by a grandfather and his grandson in the fishing town of Alacati on the coast of Turkey. 








 We need to reach our minimum target of $30,000 in order to produce all our clothes and merchandize on Viaggi By Jase King website. We want to start sending you all the perks along with the launch of the website. Your pledges will go to all aspects of this brand. The chart demonstrates where the funds will be spread out across all the different components. The more funds we have, the more items we can roll out. Almost 2/3 of the costs go into the selection of premium fabrics, printing and tailoring.

Regardless of the risks & challenges that we may face, we are committed to those who support our vision and make our brand a reality. Therefore, we vow a reciprocal pledge of complete transparency and communication with our backers. If we don't reach our entire goal, we will go launch it on a smaller scale with less products and include more items over time. 
As we have many items to produce, every pledge gets us collectively closer to revolutionizing the fashion industry. No donation is too small! We want to thank you sincerely from the bottom of our hearts, so we are releasing some of items as perks for you to own, before it's officially released!

Since there has been an overwhelming response to our first two products, we need some capital to make this venture run as smoothly and to reach as many people as possible.  We need to pay our artists, build up an inventory, and put ourselves into a position where we are not soley relying on ""preorders"" to make this happen.So we are asking those who support us to help us in some way. This relationship will be mutually beneficial as we are offering some great incentives for your support. Finally, when you consider supporting us, remember that you are investing in and promoting quality art. We are not making cheesy Christian parody shirts. We believe that we can better serve this culture by producing great apparel that points people to the Redeemer.  Thanks for your support! Soli Deo Gloria!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Like the agents it's designed for, the Stealth Sock can go anywhere and do anything.

</div></div>","Rough day at work.Scramble for a looming deadline. Presentation to a surly manager. Gunfire from villainous henchmen. One of those days.Your body sweats to keep you cool in tense situations. In fact, your feet have one of the highest concentrations of sweat glands on your body, and are confined in stifling boxes called shoes most of the day. This is not a recipe for feeling (or smelling) like success. 
 

Inspired by the archetypal super-spy, we’ve created the perfect sock to keep you looking and feeling effortlessly cool, whether stress means spreadsheets or shootouts. Through the design process, we’ve tested every product on the market and made dozens of prototypes to reach the perfect blend of features and capabilities. Like an ejection-seat-equipped sports car, the Stealth Sock’s stylishly unassuming exterior conceals the incredible technology and features that make it so awesome. 


The secret weapon behind the Stealth Sock is its unique one-two punch of fabric technologies. The first of its kind, bacteriostatic silver and activated carbon infused fibers work synergistically to keep you cool and odorless. Paired with its advanced construction methods and features, there’s no better sock on the market. 
Like the agents it's designed for, the Stealth Sock can go anywhere and do anything. Sleek and svelte, it's thin enough to fit perfectly under a handcrafted leather dress shoe, yet its ample cushioning and performance features make it equally at home under boots on the trail or sneakers and jeans off-duty.
New to the Stealth Sock family are the Recon & Zero. These sock types provide the technological punch of the Stealth Sock in more casual or beach-appropriate cuts.
 
 
True to its name, the Stealth Sock features an unmatched ability to remain undetectably fresh, even after multiple wears and heavy use. How is that possible? Well:

Stealth Sock silver fabric works by keeping bacteria, the real odor culprits, in check at healthy skin levels; without it, they grow uncontrollably leading to that locker-room smell. 

So go ahead, wear 'em again if the situation calls for it. Pack a little lighter for that trip. We won't tell - and nobody else can. 
Like your favorite gym gear, Stealth Socks fight rising temps by transporting moisture away from your skin while improving air circulation and breathability. 

To prove the Stealth Sock’s performance, we had samples tested at a 3rd party laboratory certified by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists. 


In addition to keeping feet dry and breathable, the Stealth Sock features strategically placed cushioning and a seamless toe for maximum comfort and wearability. 


Stylish clothes are worthless without proper fit, and state-of-the-art socks are useless if you spend half your time pulling at and adjusting them. By pairing our unique fiber blend with top of the line fit features, you can be confident that your Stealth Socks will always stay in place and never let you down. Self-adjusting cuff conforms to your calf
 
The Stealth Sock's unique fiber blend give it a higher degree of stretch and adaptability than most other products. As a result, it fits comfortably on feet from US Men’s 5/Women’s 6 to Men’s 14/Women’s 15. Lengthwise stretch


Some brands have caught criticism for allowing silver to leach out of their clothes and onto their wearers. Unlike cheaper, coated threads, the Stealth Sock utilizes a polymeric matrix design to encapsulate the silver in its fibers. This means the odor-fighting ability is proven to stay in the sock and off your skin, all while ensuring antimicrobial effectiveness even after 100+ washes. 

 
When we were testing other socks on the market, nothing irritated us more than spending $30 on a pair with some cool technology, only for it to pill to shreds and disintegrate after only a few wears. We vowed never to make that mistake. Besides using a naturally more wear-resistant fabric, we added:

And it’s easy to clean which is handy since you’ll probably take it on a fair few adventures.</li>

<p>The
connected car is vital in road communication. Consider the ability of cars

and V2V technology represents the next great advance in saving lives""</i> - U.S. Transportation Secretary
Anthony Foxx</p>
<p>According
to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA),
preliminary estimates of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication safety benefits
state that just with two of the multiple safety applications up to 592,000
crashes would be prevented and save 1,083 lives per year. Put another way, V2V
technology could help drivers avoid more than half of these types of crashes
that would otherwise occur by providing advance warning.</p>
<p>V2V
technology has the potential to be fused with the Blackhawk RES to further
improve the effectiveness of many crash avoidance safety systems currently
being developed and serve as a building block for a driverless vehicle.
Vehicles equipped with V2V technology could also enable the development of a
wide range of mobility and environmental benefits based on
vehicle-to-infrastructure applications and other V2V applications that can
enhance traffic flow in many ways.</p>

<p>We use an industry
standard 4 band GSM module; it can be used anywhere in the world that has GSM
network and it covers all bands of the GSM network.  For example, if one
band signal is insufficient, it will change to another band.  With a total
of 4 bands, ostensibly superior to singular band or dual band GSM modules, that
can be searched and activated, the Blackhawk RES system is robust enough for
consistent signal reception.</p>

my first car
I don’t know about you, but
as a kid I was obsessed with the ‘80’s television show, “Knight Rider.”  The Blackhawk Smartwatch Remote Engine
Starter (RES) is an attempt to make Knight Rider a reality for the everyday
driver.  
All-in-all, the patented
Blackhawk RES is an outward expression of auto enthusiasts' passion for their
vehicles.
Many have tried, but the
market is still yearning for an incredibly practical, yet user friendly
application for the smartwatch.  The Blackhawk Smartwatch RES is such a
system.  The smartwatch is fashion forward and turbocharged with
technology, poised to introduce the system to the masses.  Welcome to the
preeminent connected car experience.  
“I have spent 15 years
of my life selling mobile electronics so I am very experienced with Remote
Starts. Your technology is awesome!”
- Michael B. -- The Man Cave Colorado
“Props to you and your
team for making such a fascinating product!” - Nick Y. -- ICON Automotive Customs, LLC
“I dig your product and
look forward to working with you guys in future.” – Michael B. -- Elevation Auto Spa


The
Specialty Equipment Marketing Association (SEMA) designated the Blackhawk
Smartwatch RES as one of the Top Ten most innovative products of 2014!  This smartwatch has Caller ID, Anti-Cell
phone loss alarm, and can Un/Lock your car doors, Pop your trunk or Start your
vehicle from anywhere – Unlimited range.

Connected
Cars & Vehicle-to-Vehicle Technology
The
connected car is vital in road communication. Consider the ability of cars
closest to a blocked tunnel entrance, to relay the information back to those
cars that have time to make alternate driving routes. It also could amplify the
quality of information needed by EMS responders in regards to the severity and
specifics of accidents.

Visual Representation of V2V Communication - Source: NHTSA""Safety is our top priority,
and V2V technology represents the next great advance in saving lives"" - U.S. Transportation Secretary
Anthony Foxx
According
to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA),
preliminary estimates of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication safety benefits
state that just with two of the multiple safety applications up to 592,000
crashes would be prevented and save 1,083 lives per year. Put another way, V2V
technology could help drivers avoid more than half of these types of crashes
that would otherwise occur by providing advance warning.
V2V
technology has the potential to be fused with the Blackhawk RES to further
improve the effectiveness of many crash avoidance safety systems currently
being developed and serve as a building block for a driverless vehicle.
Vehicles equipped with V2V technology could also enable the development of a
wide range of mobility and environmental benefits based on
vehicle-to-infrastructure applications and other V2V applications that can
enhance traffic flow in many ways.

White BHK 530 & Stainless Steel BHK 818
In addition
to convenience features, the Blackhawk RES platform will be a means where
drivers can conveniently upgrade their vehicles in order to come into
compliance with upcoming regulatory measures to bring forward a
vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication environment.
""By
warning drivers of imminent danger, V2V technology has the potential to
dramatically improve highway safety,"" - NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman.

Blackhawk
RES 
The
Blackhawk RES represents the marriage of form and function.  Convenience
without compromise.  Cool core features and high quality components.
The
Blackhawk RES bridges design, form factor and convenience features that
consumers demand while providing a gateway  governments and municipalities
need for fulfilling safer and more environmentally friendly driving experiences.

T-RedZ: Our Product. Our Vision.
T-redZ is a product birthed from the frustration my husband and I had from the sheer volume of school shoes our children go through each term. It's simple!!! Shoes are not made the way they used to be made and unfortunately the shoes out there typically suffer from at least one of the following problems...
1)    OVERLY CHEAP, meaning you'll have to spend a fortune on repeated purchases multiple times within a term as they get worn-out. Most shoes today compromise on comfort, build-quality and durability in order to fit within a supermarket 'bargain bin', not to mention the compromise on ethical manufacturing standards.
2)    OVERPRICED . Times are tough and the demands of children and family life don't get any easier. Not every parent is in a position to pay Saville Row prices for a decent quality pair of shoes.
3)    INAPPROPRIATE. Many shoes for children are 'all about the bling' and flashy in design. While they may capture the attention of the child, they are considered unsuitable for the majority of school uniform policies. Yet those that are deemed acceptable are normally the polar-opposite; boring, bland and old-fashioned. There's no winning! (parents of teenagers will know what i'm talking about!).
 Sharing the same frustration as you...we decided to make a ""shoe for all""... Something trendy enough for the kids,still acceptable for schools (from whom we have received feedback from our pre prototype survey) but most importantly robust and BUILT TO LAST!!
 

What makes T-RedZ special?
T-redZ (pronounced 'treads') will be made available in two distinct styles, One for boys, and one for girls. As this is initially a product for school children it will be available in sizes covering pre-school to high-school and will retail at a RRP of £49.
T-RedZ will be constructed from a strong ETHICALLY-sourced leather. We are so confident of the durability of these shoes that we assure that under normal usage (and yes kids being kids at playtime---is normal!)the only time you will probably be replacing these shoes is when your child outgrows them. We believe that the quality of a shoe should extend beyond the upper, and we have a number of unique features/design innovations and health benefits that we are unable to disclose at this stage due to protection of intellectual property.
There is nothing else like this shoe on the market, this CAN be the next big thing and we aim to have a BRAND to stay. It is thereby essential that we get this right first time and this is where you come in!...
 

How you can help T-RedZ?
We have done all we can financially (every last scrape) to start up the company, website, and design of our prototype. However for our company to be able to deliver this shoe to our consumers all the way from our friends in China we need to physically build the prototype based on our designs and produce the first wave of orders in four styles (boys and girls / junior boys and girls) and in BULK to make it cost effective for all parties concerned, and position ourselves to be able to sell this product both online and through leading UK retailers.

Things have been progressing positively thus far, and we are well on our way  but need that final push from you guys... We hope you'll support our vision and assist in achieving our goals. This product has every chance of being the next big thing.. and you could be part of it!

<p><b>Hi, thank you for taking the time to visit our campaign.</b></p>
<p>We live in the north east of Italy, closed to Venice. Our
son Nicholas is only 7 years old but he has always been in love with motorsport and especially in kart
races. He always repeat he want become a Formula 1 pilot!<br/>
After years of insistence, last spring I decided to bring him to drive (you can see a picture here below of his first driving time with a rented kart), and in
the wonder of all, he has proven to be much much better than his peers.<br/></p>

Next fall he will be allowed to join his first kart championship and -frankly

We live in the north east of Italy, closed to Venice. Our
son Nicholas is only 7 years old but he has always been in love with motorsport and especially in kart
races. He always repeat he want become a Formula 1 pilot!
After years of insistence, last spring I decided to bring him to drive (you can see a picture here below of his first driving time with a rented kart), and in
the wonder of all, he has proven to be much much better than his peers.


He has won almost all the unofficial races he has joined - and he only used rented karts.
Next fall he will be allowed to join his first kart championship and -frankly
speaking- I do not dare to destroy his deepest dream.
I have invested all the money I could to buy him a good kart (the one in the first picture) and a small white van to bring him at the circuits but the money
needed to participate in the championship are much more than I could afford.Now he is having a lot of practice as he wants to be perfectly prepared for next year season....Please, help me to make his dream come true.

By producing these amazing quality sunglasses independently, we can cut the middle man and markups that makes most of the designer sunglasses out there extremely overpriced. We can save everyone a lot of money while providing a beautiful styled eyewear piece and make it the most comfortable sunglasses out there! Additional funds raised in addition to our goal will go to developing more frames styles for you to choose from.

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Dr. Sol Regwan and I'm a practicing Eye Doctor for the past 13 years.  I have worked extremely hard to build my practice and consider myself to be the people's doctor. 



 By carefully listening to my patients and gaining feedback about what is important to them when it comes to their eyewear, I knew Rejwan Eyewear had to be born.                          

Rejwan Eyewear is not just a campaign to raise funds for Sunglasses, it goes way beyond that.  Rejwan was born to revolutionize the way the eyewear industry has been operating over the last few decades.  I believe that the eyewear industry is being monopolized by a single entity dictating over 70% of our market with overly priced eyewear.     

Rejwan also has a special place in its heart to support and help ""Prevent Research for Blindness."" That's why we decided that we are giving a portion of our proceeds to help support this great cause.
                        
This campaign is so important to us because we want to come up with the best quality polarized sunglasses that are fun to wear, comfortable and also quite affordable. In addition to making an amazing product together, we are also helping Research to Prevent Blindness by donating a portion of every sunglass we create in hopes of helping the cause create better technology to combat blindness. Being in the eyewear field for over 13 years, we know exactly what works and what doesn't. By bringing these new prototypes to life, we can create what other sunglass lines lack. Simply, we are creating the best polarized protection with the most comfortable technologically designed frames!!
With your help we can make a significant change in the marketplace, by creating high quality frames and lenses for a cost that's affordable to us all.             

 Your support in any way shape or form will go a long way to make these prototypes come to life.  
What We Need & What You GetBy developing our own manufacturing technologies such as mold production for the frames and creating an amazing polarization process, we need your support to launch this campaign. Our goal is $9,000 and your backing will help bring these prototypes to life and get them out to the public. By producing these amazing quality sunglasses independently, we can cut the middle man and markups that makes most of the designer sunglasses out there extremely overpriced. We can save everyone a lot of money while providing a beautiful styled eyewear piece and make it the most comfortable sunglasses out there! Additional funds raised in addition to our goal will go to developing more frames styles for you to choose from. The more we raise, the larger the contribution we will provide to Research to Prevent Blindness!!By supporting and backing us, we are offering lots of perks, especially the ReJwan sunglass line!! We are also offering many more perks.

<p>The Simble is a paradigm shift to the Smartwatch world. As a perfect hybrid of elegance in design and smart technology, it is here to offer you a better quality of life. You’ll enjoy the little details like it’s expertly hidden cutting-edge technology built under the minimalist design. Or the fact that it helps you get the most out of the little amount of time in your day while also being able to complete any outfit with finesse. The classic watch-face means there are no bright or oversized LED screens, loud notifications or need to charge it before going out.

<p>The Simble is designed to look, be, and act elegant. It is a natural extension of your style, class, and character. The stainless steel body &amp; traditional watch face show a different you to the world, while the tech inside shows you everything else.</p>
<p> The Simble’s design hides a number of smartwatch features inside the tasteful body of a classic watch, and tells you everything you’d want to know without informing everyone around you. With a simple, elegant face, it’s beautiful to look at as it draws upon the honored tradition of its ancestors; the uncountable, timeless wristwatches of ages past.</p>

<p>The Simble watch face is covered and protected by a sapphire glass cover, which is highly resistant to scratches and abrasion. It’s so strong that it is 15 times stronger than regular glass. We modeled our protection after Swiss watch brands, such as Rolex, Tissot, and Jean Perret who all use the same Sapphire glass coating to protect their watch faces.</p>

<p>Express yourself with your Simble. Whether you prefer a classic leather, rugged NATO or the fashionable Milanese band, don’t miss out on the opportunity to demonstrate your style and class.

<p>The Simple watch lets you choose who or what is allowed to interrupt you. Allow the right people to reach you with a gentle vibration.

<p>Simble is all about creating a smartwatch with modern functionality under a traditional watch design. Thought of and built by Haslip. We formed in January of 2016, originally specializing in healthcare and big data, but our aim was to provide the best services based on personal data. With this in mind we’ve now expanded into integrating personal motion and physical data (PMPD) into an intelligent terminal, creating the Simble smartwatch and the D-MAP mobile app. Our early prototypes were met with healthy excitement and success and we managed to find our initial funding from Chinese backers to create our first prototypes and iron out the design flaws. Now, with an perfected Simble smartwatch, we are hoping to start shipping globally and provide a smartwatch which perfectly blends high functionality into a timeless look.</p>

With a simple, elegant face, it’s beautiful to look at as it draws upon the honored tradition of its ancestors; the uncountable, timeless wristwatches of ages past.
 
MADE WITH SAPPHIRE GLASS

The Simble watch face is covered and protected by a sapphire glass cover, which is highly resistant to scratches and abrasion. It’s so strong that it is 15 times stronger than regular glass. We modeled our protection after Swiss watch brands, such as Rolex, Tissot, and Jean Perret who all use the same Sapphire glass coating to protect their watch faces.
 
QUALITY BANDS FOR A QUALITY WATCH


Express yourself with your Simble. Whether you prefer a classic leather, rugged NATO or the fashionable Milanese band, don’t miss out on the opportunity to demonstrate your style and class. There are 3 different bands, with the three different Milanese Mesh bands, so you can choose the one says “you”.
 
STANDS THE TEST OF TIME


Carrying the build of traditional watchmaking, the Simble is a mechanical watch made to last a lifetime. The tiny intricate gears, springs, and sprockets are protected by a stainless steel body which is guaranteed to put up with the same daily stress you do.
 
WATERPROOF - UP TO 50 METERS

The Simble smartwatch can stand up to the pressure. Like the pressure 50 meters of water has.  
 
THE RIGHT TIME ALL THE TIME

No matter where in the world you go the Simble keeps up with you. It automatically adjusts to your time zone, so you’ll never be late for a flight or miss a siesta ever again!
 
FITNESS, SLEEP, AND HEART TRACKING

Get moving with Simble’s fully loaded activity tracker. Keeping an eye on everything from step-counting, distance, to monitoring your heart-rate. It even works when you don't. The advanced sleep monitor tracks your sleep pattern, learns when you sleep and when you wake up and works to give you a more restful night.
 
CUTTING-EDGE BLUETOOTH TECH

The Simble smartwatch is powered by the newest Bluetooth 5.0 technology. Giving you double the speed, quadrupled range, and eight times the connectionless data broadcasts.
 
PHONE NOTIFICATIONS

The Simple watch lets you choose who or what is allowed to interrupt you. Allow the right people to reach you with a gentle vibration. The vibration and the indicator of the watch hands tell you what kind of notification you are receiving. No need to keep an eye on your phone. Distractions are costly, so be picky.
 
KEEP UP-TO-DATE WITHOUT EVEN TRYING

 
The D-MAP app seamlessly connects your Simble to your phone, allowing you to see the data in collects in real time, take photos using your Simble, and access and customize all of the functions available. The app also comes with over-the-air updates to give you the latest functions and to keep the Simble running smoothly. Just tap to accept the download and it will begin.
 
CAMERA CONTROLS

The built-in camera control lets you switch places, from always being the person behind the camera to sharing the moment in front of it. Take a picture from your phone by just shaking your Simble back and forth.

HOW SIMBLE COMPARES
 


HOW FAR WE'VE COME
 

 
OUR SIMBLE ROOTS

Simble is all about creating a smartwatch with modern functionality under a traditional watch design. Thought of and built by Haslip. We formed in January of 2016, originally specializing in healthcare and big data, but our aim was to provide the best services based on personal data. With this in mind we’ve now expanded into integrating personal motion and physical data (PMPD) into an intelligent terminal, creating the Simble smartwatch and the D-MAP mobile app. Our early prototypes were met with healthy excitement and success and we managed to find our initial funding from Chinese backers to create our first prototypes and iron out the design flaws. Now, with an perfected Simble smartwatch, we are hoping to start shipping globally and provide a smartwatch which perfectly blends high functionality into a timeless look.

<h3></h3>
<p>I am a Mechanical Engineer and I
recently got a 3D Printer.  I thought that was the end All Be All for
being an Engineer with an active Hobby life.  Strangely enough it
was not.  My Printer uses an Acrylic building plate. Not that uncommon
among the lower priced 3D Printers.  My builds would get stuck to the
build plate or not stick at all and get released before the build was complete.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would have to use
hard tools to remove the projects from my build plate.  As a result, my
build plate very often would get damaged.  I would also lose the part I
was creating as well. Giving me some serious buyer’s remorse - and a full
project Trash Bin.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, I got little
to no help from the manufacturer and I then learned that this is not a unique
problem to my 3D Printer... but a wide variety of 3D Printers with hard build
plates had the same problems.</p>
<p>Taking that as a challenge, I
resolved to find a solution.  I call it 3D EeZ. For the Ease at which ones
build can be removed afterwards.  It is very easy to use and is
reusable.  Watch the video where we remove a build I had never
before been able to build successfully before I came up with 3D EeZ.<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg1w6dXKHGU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg1w6dXKHGU</a>  Then ask yourself, ""Why didn’t the company I
bought my Printer from, not come up with something like this?""</p>
<p>Here is a Video of me applying the 3D EeZ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flBy8lY0U24"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flBy8lY0U24</a><br/></p>

to no help from the manufacturer and I then learned that this is not a unique
problem to my 3D Printer... but a wide variety of 3D Printers with hard build
plates had the same problems.
Taking that as a challenge, I
resolved to find a solution.  I call it 3D EeZ. For the Ease at which ones
build can be removed afterwards.  It is very easy to use and is
reusable.  Watch the video where we remove a build I had never
before been able to build successfully before I came up with 3D EeZ.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg1w6dXKHGU  Then ask yourself, ""Why didn’t the company I
bought my Printer from, not come up with something like this?""
Here is a Video of me applying the 3D EeZ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flBy8lY0U24",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Our Story</h3>The Nakate Project was launched at the end of 2010. Nakate is an initiative working on the ground in a rural area of 
Uganda called the Nakasangola district. Nakasangola is known for its 
poverty, itâ€™s problem with AIDS, malaria and TB, witchcraft, drinking 
problems, polygamy, prostitution, and for its abuse of women and 
children.
<p>Because of itâ€™s rural placement, there is a lack of aid in the 
district, and thus a lack of tourists. So, the women in our district are
 less developed skill-wise than women in more populated areas of the 
country because they havenâ€™t had a market to sell to. At the same time, 
they also have less opportunity business wise, and have been more 
marginalized than women in more developed areas of the Uganda.</p>
<p>We launched Nakate in Nakasangola on purpose, because we felt that these 
women, in particular, needed to be noticed and empowered. So, for a year
 now, weâ€™ve been working to help them grow in their newly acquired skill as jewelry makers. Along the way, weâ€™ve been focusing on helping 
them to re-construct how they view themselves as women. Instead of poor,
 diseased, left behind, we want them to see themselves as artisans, 
designers, business women, and as women that have the power to make 
choices â€“ choices about where they live, about whether they send their 
children to school, about where they want to open a bank account, and 
what theyâ€™d like to do with their money. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>In February, we will be spending two months on the ground working with the women in our project to expand our reach beyond jewelry to shoes and bags. We'll be helping them to understand quality control as they work to fulfill wholesale orders, and helping train them in time and money management. We will also be implementing the work of several local Rwandan immigrants, as we have them teach our artisans to make tightly woven bags, as well as leather sandals and cow horn jewelry. <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Because we are a company that's still at the grassroots level, we're at the point where we're turning women that would like to work for us away because we just don't have the financial means to take them on as artisans yet. We're growing slowly yet surely, but our lack of funding keeps us from buying a huge amount of items on the ground. We've become the most reliable source of income in Kakooge, and there are women waiting to become part of our program. Our goal on the ground in February is to be able to buy more items and expand our reach. Your funding will help us do that as we work to buy bags, shoes and cow horn items from the women we work with. The money you donate will be used for these purposes exclusively, and will not be put towards travel expenses or other overhead costs. <br/></p>

<b>1)</b> <b>A ratchet style belt</b> that adjusts every ¼ inch with 
32 different sizing options. This means no holes and a perfect fit every
 single time. Adjust the belt throughout the day or week as your weight 
fluctuates.<br/><br/><p><b>2) Built to last a decade. </b>The belt is made 
from 100% Italian Genuine Leather and the buckle is constructed from 
Zinc Alloy. The durability and quality far surpasses other adjustable 
belts. See the side by side comparison below for details</p>
<p><b>3) More affordable than other adjustable belts. </b>A
 perfect fitting belt shouldn't cost twice as much as a regular holes 
belt. Our prices are guaranteed to be at least $20 cheaper than other 
adjustable belts.</p>
<p><b>4) Customization and personalization. </b>A 
belt may be a wardrobe accessory but it still should reflect your 
personality and interests. Add your favorite college/sports logo, 
artwork, flag, or anything else to personalize the buckle and belt.</p>
<p><b>5) Interchangeable buckles. </b>All
 ZipBelt buckles use the same ratchet system. Easily swap out a buckle 
for another while keeping the same colored leather belt. ZipBelt is 
taking accessorizing to a new level.</p></span></span></span><p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Traditional belts never have enough size options with only 5 holes or
 5 sizes. The ZipBelt adjusts every ¼ inch with 32 different sizing 
options. In actual waist sizes we can currently offer <b>US Men's sizes 28 - 55 inches</b>. 
 When we showed the ZipBelt to several of our friends, we had the same 
resounding reaction about sizes - ""It's exactly what I needed - a belt 
that fluctuates as my weight fluctuates for a perfect fit every time.""</p>
<p>In the near future, we will have smaller and larger sizes as we continually expand the ZipBelt product line.</p>

<p>The ZipBelt allows customers to customize belt buckles and leather 
belts through personalized images, logos, and text. We currently are the
 ONLY adjustable belt company that offers customization. We've already 
secured a partnership and agreement with the <b>NCAA, NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS, and more </b>to add your favorite sports team logos on the ZipBelt buckles. </p>
<p>Also
 we're partnering with Universities across the USA to allow mascots to 
be placed on the face of the buckle. Create any high resolution artwork,
 send us a vector file of the artwork, and we'll engrave it on the 
buckle or leather belt strap. It's that simple and it's what sets us 
apart from the competition! *(See Disclaimer at the bottom of this page)</p>
<p><b>If you order a customized ZipBelt, we will send you a survey at the end of the Indiegogo to get your info and image and get your customization started.</b><br/></p>

<p>We've already had a couple test runs of the ZipBelt manufactured
 and shipped to us and have had an overwhelming response from the 
community to produce more. Your support will help us to secure the 
minimum order quantity set by the factory as well as to have the items 
shipped to us within 1 week of manufacturing completion. We want to make
 sure that these belts are in all of our Indiegogo supporters' hands before 
Christmas (in the USA only). As already noted, the product has been 
designed, developed, manufactured, and fully tested. Packaging has also 
been completed as well and shipping has been secured through FedEx. 
Customs has also been ironed out as we've received a couple shipments of
 the ZipBelt. </p>
<p>Our factory can produce up to 10,000 belts per month, so 
we believe that we will be more than ready to fulfill all orders on IndieGoGo . The factory will manufacture all of the belts, package 
them, and label them according to size. They will then ship it to us by 
FedEx express shipping to Los Angeles, which will then clear customs and
 be shipped to our headquarters in Utah. As all ZipBelts will be 
packaged in an individual gift box and labeled by size and color, we 
will then ship it directly to YOU, our loyal Indiegogo backer. </p>

<ul>
<li>The belts and buckles are designed. Prototypes were made and tested. Now the belts are ready for the first production run.</li>
<li>A partnership with a reliable manufacturer has been formed. Shipping times and costs have been tested.</li>
<li>The ""engraving"" customization has been tested and perfected.</li>
<li>The ZipBelt website has been setup to take additional direct orders once the Indiegogo is complete. </li>
<li>Negotiations with local and online distributors have begun and will hopefully be solidified during the Indiegogo.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where you come in and how you can help. Your pledges 
will directly go toward expanding the available ZipBelt buckle designs 
and belt colors, help design and manufacture a ZipBelt for women, and 
pay for the the machine that will print customized designs on the face 
of the buckle and on the leather belt. </p>
<p>After the Indiegogo 
campaign, the various styles of ZipBelt will likely retail for $15-25 more

1) A ratchet style belt that adjusts every ¼ inch with 
32 different sizing options. This means no holes and a perfect fit every
 single time. Adjust the belt throughout the day or week as your weight 
fluctuates.2) Built to last a decade. The belt is made 
from 100% Italian Genuine Leather and the buckle is constructed from 
Zinc Alloy. The durability and quality far surpasses other adjustable 
belts. See the side by side comparison below for details
3) More affordable than other adjustable belts. A
 perfect fitting belt shouldn't cost twice as much as a regular holes 
belt. Our prices are guaranteed to be at least $20 cheaper than other 
adjustable belts.
4) Customization and personalization. A 
belt may be a wardrobe accessory but it still should reflect your 
personality and interests. Add your favorite college/sports logo, 
artwork, flag, or anything else to personalize the buckle and belt.
5) Interchangeable buckles. All
 ZipBelt buckles use the same ratchet system. Easily swap out a buckle 
for another while keeping the same colored leather belt. ZipBelt is 
taking accessorizing to a new level.

ZIPBELT IN THE PRESS AND BLOGS


ZIPBELT WILL BE SOLD IN THE MISSIONARY MALL STORES!





The ZipBelt buckle locks firmly into place on each of the 1/4 inch 
grooves on the inside of  the belt for a perfect fit when feeding the 
belt through. It works just like a zip tie, hence the name ZipBelt, 
except it can be loosened when pressing on the lever to release the lock
 and pulling the belt away from you to your right. See the ZipBelt in 
action in the photos below or the video above.




The ZipBelt is now available with 3 different belt buckles and 3 
different colored leather belt straps depicted in the images below. More
 buckle styles and belt colors will be added when we meet our IndieGoGo goal and expand the ZipBelt product line.


Traditional belts never have enough size options with only 5 holes or
 5 sizes. The ZipBelt adjusts every ¼ inch with 32 different sizing 
options. In actual waist sizes we can currently offer US Men's sizes 28 - 55 inches. 
 When we showed the ZipBelt to several of our friends, we had the same 
resounding reaction about sizes - ""It's exactly what I needed - a belt 
that fluctuates as my weight fluctuates for a perfect fit every time.""
In the near future, we will have smaller and larger sizes as we continually expand the ZipBelt product line.



The ZipBelt allows customers to customize belt buckles and leather 
belts through personalized images, logos, and text. We currently are the
 ONLY adjustable belt company that offers customization. We've already 
secured a partnership and agreement with the NCAA, NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS, and more to add your favorite sports team logos on the ZipBelt buckles. 
Also
 we're partnering with Universities across the USA to allow mascots to 
be placed on the face of the buckle. Create any high resolution artwork,
 send us a vector file of the artwork, and we'll engrave it on the 
buckle or leather belt strap. It's that simple and it's what sets us 
apart from the competition! *(See Disclaimer at the bottom of this page)
If you order a customized ZipBelt, we will send you a survey at the end of the Indiegogo to get your info and image and get your customization started.





Sun Choi - As my parents are entrepreneurs, I too started as 
an entrepreneur at the age of 14 detailing cars in my neighborhood. From
 there, I started several different businesses on the side during my 
free time while still learning from the successes and failures of my 
parents' businesses. I recently sold my web design company (one of the 
largest in the State of Utah for small to medium sized businesses) to 
focus on ZipBelt and in 2011 sold a Men's Wedding Bands e-commerce 
company. 
Casey Choi - My Father is my partner for the 
ZipBelt and helps me with the day to day operations along with 
negotiations for securing vendors for the ZipBelt. He is a successful 
entrepreneur and currently owns a multi-million dollar company in the 
restaurant and food services industry.

all product photos. Also Matt manages all marketing efforts for ZipBelt,
 including the Indiegogo, PR, blog articles, and Social Media. 
Nixon Pierre - Owner of BeautahfulCreations.com
 and partner for expanding the product line for ZipBelt in NCAA, NFL, 
MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS, and more! Nixon is a successful entrepreneur and 
owner of multiple companies.

He also wants to note that he looks devilishly handsome in his ZipBelt :). 
Jordan Liau - Jordan is supervising all social media efforts for ZipBelt across Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram. He works with Matt to improve visibility of the ZipBelt and larger viral appeal.












We've already had a couple test runs of the ZipBelt manufactured
 and shipped to us and have had an overwhelming response from the 
community to produce more. Your support will help us to secure the 
minimum order quantity set by the factory as well as to have the items 
shipped to us within 1 week of manufacturing completion. We want to make
 sure that these belts are in all of our Indiegogo supporters' hands before 
Christmas (in the USA only). As already noted, the product has been 
designed, developed, manufactured, and fully tested. Packaging has also 
been completed as well and shipping has been secured through FedEx. 
Customs has also been ironed out as we've received a couple shipments of
 the ZipBelt. 
Our factory can produce up to 10,000 belts per month, so 
we believe that we will be more than ready to fulfill all orders on IndieGoGo . The factory will manufacture all of the belts, package 
them, and label them according to size. They will then ship it to us by 
FedEx express shipping to Los Angeles, which will then clear customs and
 be shipped to our headquarters in Utah. As all ZipBelts will be 
packaged in an individual gift box and labeled by size and color, we 
will then ship it directly to YOU, our loyal Indiegogo backer. 



The belts and buckles are designed. Prototypes were made and tested. Now the belts are ready for the first production run.
A partnership with a reliable manufacturer has been formed. Shipping times and costs have been tested.
The ""engraving"" customization has been tested and perfected.
The ZipBelt website has been setup to take additional direct orders once the Indiegogo is complete. 
Negotiations with local and online distributors have begun and will hopefully be solidified during the Indiegogo.

This is where you come in and how you can help. Your pledges 
will directly go toward expanding the available ZipBelt buckle designs 
and belt colors, help design and manufacture a ZipBelt for women, and 
pay for the the machine that will print customized designs on the face 
of the buckle and on the leather belt. 
After the Indiegogo 
campaign, the various styles of ZipBelt will likely retail for $15-25 more 
than the Indiegogo price. We believe in rewarding loyal supporters by 
giving them a superior product and saving them money.

ZipBelt more than any other belt. If you can't support ZipBelt by purchasing a belt, you can still help us out! Please share the ZipBelt Indiegogo http://igg.me/at/zipbelt/x/5155526 on Facebook and Twitter.

The only EU clothing we saw was uninspired and awful; poorly made advertising t-shirts. During the past year we have worked hard to make a change. We designed a prototype collection for every age, taste and occasion. Sometimes a bold statement, sometimes more subtle. We intend to make the collection even more varied over the coming months. It all depends on the amount of funding we can raise. BUY A VOUCHERBuy a voucher now. We are not yet sure if the collection will be available to the general public after the crowdfunding campaign ends. It all depends on the amount of funding we can raise. The voucher you buy will be valid on the whole collection, available through a web-shop. You choose whatever you like. After a purchase, any remainder of the vouchers value will be usable in a next purchase.To thank you for your early support we like to give you a discount. Check out the different perks to see how much you can save. WHAT WILL THE CLOTHING COST?We will not only make quality and sustainable clothing, we aim to make it affordable as well. That's why we are trying to raise as much crowdfunding as possible. It is logical, if we can produce in large numbers, the costs will go down and we can lower the prices. Join the mission and help us advertise :)Above every picture you will find a realistic target price (all pictures at the bottom of this page). WHEN WILL THE COLLECTION BE AVAILABLE?The designs are ready, we only have to make a deal with the manufacturer based on the success of this campaign and the related amount of clothing we want to have produced. We estimate the clothing will be ready early spring 2018.WHY FASHION WITH THE EU FLAG?We want to reclaim our name. Being European does not mean you are a bureaucrat in Brussels. It is not a political position. It's a sense of togetherness, not based on origin, nationality nor opinion. It's you and it's me. It's a response to the recent hate. Ignore cynicism, we feel European and we are proud of it! WHAT'S THE UNTIMATE GOAL?First let us tell you what is not aiming for. We don't intend to make any money on this project. We just want to bring fashion with the European flag to life. If this crowdfunding campaign proves a success, we might even be able to convince big clothing stores to join us and include the 'EU flag clothing' in their collection. Imagine, fashion with the European flag in stores all over the continent or the globe. Accessible to all. It's our ultimate goal and we are willing to invest all the collected funding to achieve it.HELP US PROMOTE! #euflagfashionWe can't do it without you. Join the mission! Share, tweet, like and talk. On the top of this page you will find the various 'social media buttons'. It's important to not only share the link, but to also write something about it. Apparently not many people click on a link that is not introduced. :)Facebook - Twitter - Instagram Thank you! Let's awaken our European stars...ABOUT THE MAKERSSenne Dehandschutter, a film director from Belgium, is the founder of this project. He feels passionate about Europe's future and wants to wear some stylish clothing with the European flag. After searching the internet and scouring shops he had to admit defeat. The only EU clothing he found was uninspired and awful. He gathered some friends and together they are trying to make a change.

<p><br/>I have two campaigns going on! One is for me to attend September 2012 Brooklyn Fashion Weekend which my deadline to register as a Headline Designer ends in August 31, 2012 as their are only 4 openings left my time is running short. The registration fee is keeping me from achieving this dream which if not registered with 50% deposit I cannot participate.</p>
<p>My second campaign is for D'NALEL DESIGNS Storefront Design Boutique on Wheels which ends in December 2012! Please check out both campaigns as both are two dreams that with your help I can make come true! Thanks for your support &amp; patronage! Below is little bio about me details about fund usage!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inspired by my love for Interior Design, Fabrics, Home Décor,  and all things Victorian, I breathed life into D’nalel Designs. D'nalel Designs is a small independent company founded in 2008 before the birth of my son Leland.  The name D'nalel is Leland spelled backwards. (PRONUNCIATION: D-NA-LEL).</p>
<p>I'm known for my “Retro” style, which includes the 80's, Shabby Chic, Victorian, and Vintage clothing. I integrate a broad style mix of vintage elements with modern and practical recycling, which makes them unique, custom handcrafted home décor elements. My eye for design emerged when I was little, watching my mother often rearrange furniture and re-decorate our home.  While attending Suffolk University New England School of Art &amp; Design I was chosen to design a bedroom on an episode of HGTV Designer Finals. After attending school, I worked in the Interior Design Field, with retail chains like Ethan Allen.</p>
<p>  My love for fabrics led me to create my own pocketbook line named ""Victorian Vintage"" &amp; Cultural Fusions"" which are elegant clutches adorned with home decor fringe trim. ""Victorian Vintage"" has been seen in the hands of a few celebrities, graced fashion blogs and fashion magazines. This campaign is important to me because it will allow me to make two dreams into reality. The funds raised will allow me to be a Headline Designer for Brooklyn Fashion Weekend September 2012, which is an awesome opportunity because my handbag designs will walk the runway and could give me a chance to feature my designs NYC Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week 2013. The registration fee is keeping me from achieving this dream which if not registered by August 30, I cannot participate.  Please keep reading on to see breakdown of funds needed and detailed description of Brooklyn Fashion Weekend.

<p>Cyclists who ride in congested cities are naturally concerned about safety. On most occasions we stay ‘curb side’ to avoid the potential of a head on collision. Gladly, in London TfL have supported this by establishing green or blue cycle lanes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately casualties are still too high with many cyclists deaths caused by lorries turning left. These collisions are not deliberate and many haulage owners try to help by plastering yellow signs on their lorries to warn cyclists against filtering on the inside even though the highway code allows it.</p>

<p>To raise awareness of this issue I’ve decided to create some signage of my own and have designed 3 cool tee shirts.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<div>Hi I'm Joseph. I am an 18 year old student, passionate about bringing cycling casualties to the forefront of people's attention and promoting a mutually safer road environment for users. I am both a cyclist and a driver and understand there are issues on both sides that can contribute towards collisions. However the issue I have is that the government and haulage businesses in particular believe they can solve these issues with very aggressive anti-cyclist signs. These usually sound like: ""CYCLISTS stay back"" or similar. This inspired me to create the Redacted T-Shirt campaign, kicking back at these ridiculous vehicle signs.</div>
<div>   </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The more pledges I can get, the more money goes to charity. Its that simple.

</div></div>","New Perk - Spiro Bikewear Top


After listening to comments I've introduced this performance cycling top. Featuring COOL-DRY moisture wicking fabric to keep skin cool and comfortable. One design only in Aqua/Black with the 'HGV' logo. Men's and women's sizes available.  


                  

   See article                                              See article

Cyclists who ride in congested cities are naturally concerned about safety. On most occasions we stay ‘curb side’ to avoid the potential of a head on collision. Gladly, in London TfL have supported this by establishing green or blue cycle lanes.
Unfortunately casualties are still too high with many cyclists deaths caused by lorries turning left. These collisions are not deliberate and many haulage owners try to help by plastering yellow signs on their lorries to warn cyclists against filtering on the inside even though the highway code allows it.


To raise awareness of this issue I’ve decided to create some signage of my own and have designed 3 cool tee shirts.
                The HGV                                 The Lorry                                The Bus 



The Shirts
I’ve sourced 100 percent cotton tee shirts and produced these three designs. They look great on or off the  bike. I’ve got sizing covered and can offer small to double XL. If I reach my target I will write to every contributor giving more detail about sizing and ask for your choice.

Superior quality, 100% Belcoro yarn cotton for a softer feel and durability.
The Charity

I’ve joined up with a great charity called Roadpeace who support families of road crash victims as well as campaign for safer roads.

Frequent OTA Updates
The Ticwear OS Global Edition has been refined over 5 versions since May 2016, with the continued devotion of our tester community. We are committed to listening to you, our community, and look forward to improving the OS even more with your help.

A watch should look like a watch. We forged Ticwatch 2 in collaboration with world class designers, including award-winning Scandinavian designer, Mika Nenonen. Our relentless dedication toward the perfection of every detail has allowed us to successfully combine both functionality and fashion. Our design reflects the principles that we persist: simplicity, quality, and craftsmanship.

Invisible Tickle
Tickle, inherited from Ticwatch first generation's signature design, co-designed with frog , is the side touch strip that allows users to control screens, slide app menus, zoom in and out, and control volume.
The Ticwatch 2 built on this foundation to further improve material and sensor integration. We are proud to announce the Ticwatch 2 Tickle, invisible, with a smoother touch experience.

<h3><strong>How We Started</strong></h3>
<p>Petpuls is the life’s mission of founder and CEO, Vincent Kim, who became a dog lover at an early age. His first dog, Sunni, was a mixed breed that loved him fiercely and followed him everywhere. </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593140826/ciouuj7xb5fqcnemuals.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Early in his career and while completing his doctoral program at Korean National Maritime and Ocean University, Kim created an online pet care/sitter service that became an instant hit among pet lovers and travelers alike. This success combined with Kim’s love of dogs and technology led him to believe he could create an IoT device with AI-driven data to help dog owners better understand their canine companions through a unique voice recognition system. </p>
<p>Supported by an R&amp;D team at Seoul National University, Kim developed Petpuls to unite all dog lovers and their families and create a safe, fun and playful community. He is currently a dog parent to Dori, a Korean Jindo he’s gotten to know even better through a little miracle device called Petpuls.</p>

LOVE @ First Step, Inc. or L@FS™ is a Delaware company established in 2013. L@FS™ specializes in casual and hip footwear using TYVEK® material making our products comfortable to wear, lightweight, water resistant and eco-friendly.

The Idea
L@FS™ is the brainchild of finance and accounting professional, Jocelyn Pontecore. Nowadays, products sold in the United States use materials made from other countries. Jocelyn initially started with the idea of making a product made from materials manufactured in the USA to support the local economy in her own way. She saw how TYVEK® was being widely used in building houses, packaging materials, etc. because of its durability. Why not use the same material on something we use everyday?

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Michelle and I have graduated from the art institute of Seattle in 2011 with a associates in fashion design. After graduation I was hired by a Japanese media company as part of the international team in charge of the fashion department. During my employment, I traveled to New York, London, Paris and Milan to cover the fashion weeks. At the fashion weeks I was able to go backstage and conduct interviews with the fashion designers. Through this experience I have decided to reach for that goal of showing starting my collection and one day have my own fashion show in NYC.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because it will fund a fashion collection that is trying to spread the word of a beautiful culture.</p>
<p>With your donation, I will be able to create a line of dresses that will be shown in various fashion shows in Seattle by the end of the year. I have already talked to various fashion show organizers, and have received a lot of interest in the collection.</p>
<p>What I Really Need &amp; What You Will Receive in Return</p>
<p>This contribution will go towards the hand dyed bingata fabric. It will take around three months from the time I order it to when it will get here. I have already talked to the people in Okinawa, and they are ready to take my order.  I already have the dresses drafted, and will make the patterns. )I am ordering the rest of the fabric for the dresses after I have placed the order for Okinawa.) Once I have the fabric from Okinawa, I will sew each dress. Right now I have 8 evening gowns planned.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal, I will still see how much fabric I can order. I will make dresses just not as many as I had planned :)</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>I was born and raised on the Island of Okinawa. When I was growing up I was surrounded by the unique culture. I would go to watch the traditional dances where the ladies would wear kimonos made with bingata dyed on silk. I always asked myself “what would it look like if I made a bingata dress? Would people even know that the dress had bingata incorporated in it?” When I left the island I decided to go down a path that would make that thought a reality. I attended the art institute of Seattle part time as I worked full time. It was a lot of hard work but I never gave up. Today I work part time as a barista as I chase my dream of creating a fashion line that has hand dyed bingata incorporated in it. I have the drive, and your contribution will make a difference.

<p>Hi! We're Cindy and Julia - the <a href=""http://www.craftybroads.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crafty Broads</a>. After making our wedding dresses and planning the big event, we realized we'd be great at helping other people do the same, and we launched Crafty Broads. We now specialize in custom garments, alterations, and wedding planning. </p>
<p>We think the fashion industry is using unbelievably misguided notions (and measurements!) when creating the clothing we wear every day, and we are trying to change that, one garment at a time. We want to make clothes that fit and flatter YOUR figure, no matter what size or shape that may be.</p>
<p>When it comes to weddings, we think the only critical parts are picking the right person and following the rules of whatever government and/or religion you want your marriage recognized by. Everything else is up to you, and we will gladly help you make it happen.</p>
<h3>Why are we asking for your money and what will we do with it?</h3>
<p>Over the past two years, we've grown explosively and we saved up <em>just enough</em> money to move the shop out of our guest room and into a storefront. Trouble is, that storefront is empty.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Crafty Broads Studio"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MrjLVgLZ3QU/Ueb9VHXBB1I/AAAAAAAADh8/qgrdRoD77P4/s400/photo.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h2><strong>Your contribution today will help fund our capital expenses so that we can keep our shop open for the long haul.</strong></h2>
<p>We have some basics already, but here's what we'll be spending these funds on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work tables for our sewing machines</li>
<li>Cutting table</li>
<li>Storage Cabinets for our fabrics and notions</li>
<li>Full-length mirrors for our fitting room</li>
<li>Closet system to hang garments in progress and alterations</li>
<li>Boring office stuff, like a computer, printer, filing cabinet, and phone</li>
<li>Seating for our clients and ourselves</li>
<li>Lighting and new paint for the walls</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.craftybroads.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Crafty Broads Website"">Website</a> redesign if we exceed our goal!</li>
</ul><p>If we don't meet our goal, we will prioritize this list and use the money we do raise towards the most crucial items. Having a well-equipped shop will help us to get many more clients into perfectly-fitted clothes! It will also allow us to begin developing a line of custom-fit jeans, the number one trouble garment if anecdotal evidence is accurate. If we exceed our goal, we'd like to work on the number two problem - bras!</p>
<h2>PERKS!</h2>
<p>We have what we think are some great perks for you when you give $25 or more:</p>
<h3>Contribute $25 or more and we'll write a blog post about your biggest clothing pet peeve.</h3>
<p>We want to know - what is the most annoying thing about buying mass-produced clothing? Tell us what drives YOU crazy! We will write it up on our blog, dissect the problem to figure out why it is the way it is, give you some strategies for combatting it when you're shopping, and (of course!) explain how creating a custom garment can eliminate the issue entirely!</p>
<h3>Contribute $50 or more and you'll get 2 hours of event planning consultation to use any way you like.</h3>
<p>You can use this for getting a handle on your wedding ideas and plans, having us research vendors or venues for you, a wedding budget strategy session, or just ask us anything else you want for two whole hours. We can meet in person in Chicago, or through the magical powers of the internet anywhere else, so this perk is available to EVERYONE.</p>
<h3>Contribute $75 or more and we'll handmake you a Crafty Broads tote bag AND we'll invite you to our Launch Party in Chicago this August.</h3>
<p>Your tote bag will be made of durable fabric in our signature colors, teal and brown, with our logo. It's the perfect size for schlepping home a farmers' market haul, carrying all your beach gear, or carrying home a custom garment from us. Shipping is included within the continental United States only; we can ship anywhere else at an additional fee.</p>
<p>The first 25 people to contribute at this level will receive an invitation to the Launch Party for our shop in August. The drinks are on us while you tour the shop and ask us anything.</p>
<h3>Contribute $150 or more and we will make you a custom silk tie, in any color you like; OR you we will make alterations to a garment of your choice.</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt=""Custom Silk Tie"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MNBgi6uFbwo/UeNx69VKWkI/AAAAAAAADiQ/-vkkEudiFzc/s288/Silk-Tie.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A silk tie is a beautiful thing - so lovely that every time we make one, we try to think of occasions on which we might wear one ourselves. You choose the color from a plethora of options. 100% silk dupioni; shipping anywhere included. </p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Bring us a garment that needs some <a href=""http://www.craftybroads.com/clothing/alterations.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Crafty Broads Alterations"">alterations</a>, and we will make it fit like a glove! You must redeem this perk in person at our new Chicago shop. Appointments are required.</p>
<h3>Contribute $500 or more and custom jeans are headed your way.</h3>
<p>We are beginning research and development on a line of custom-fit jeans. This is one of the biggest clothing hassles we hear about from women, and we want to do something about it. We'll measure you, create a pattern, do a trial fitting (or two, or three...) until we get it right, and then stitch up a pair of jeans that fit you just how you like them. You must redeem this perk in person at our new Chicago shop. Appointments are required.</p>
<h3>Contribute $1000 or more and we'll make a custom corset for you OR we'll coordinate your wedding day.</h3>

We will write it up on our blog, dissect the problem to figure out why it is the way it is, give you some strategies for combatting it when you're shopping, and (of course!) explain how creating a custom garment can eliminate the issue entirely!
Contribute $50 or more and you'll get 2 hours of event planning consultation to use any way you like.
You can use this for getting a handle on your wedding ideas and plans, having us research vendors or venues for you, a wedding budget strategy session, or just ask us anything else you want for two whole hours. We can meet in person in Chicago, or through the magical powers of the internet anywhere else, so this perk is available to EVERYONE.
Contribute $75 or more and we'll handmake you a Crafty Broads tote bag AND we'll invite you to our Launch Party in Chicago this August.
Your tote bag will be made of durable fabric in our signature colors, teal and brown, with our logo. It's the perfect size for schlepping home a farmers' market haul, carrying all your beach gear, or carrying home a custom garment from us. Shipping is included within the continental United States only; we can ship anywhere else at an additional fee.
The first 25 people to contribute at this level will receive an invitation to the Launch Party for our shop in August. The drinks are on us while you tour the shop and ask us anything.
Contribute $150 or more and we will make you a custom silk tie, in any color you like; OR you we will make alterations to a garment of your choice.

A silk tie is a beautiful thing - so lovely that every time we make one, we try to think of occasions on which we might wear one ourselves. You choose the color from a plethora of options. 100% silk dupioni; shipping anywhere included. 
OR
Bring us a garment that needs some alterations, and we will make it fit like a glove! You must redeem this perk in person at our new Chicago shop. Appointments are required.
Contribute $500 or more and custom jeans are headed your way.
We are beginning research and development on a line of custom-fit jeans. This is one of the biggest clothing hassles we hear about from women, and we want to do something about it. We'll measure you, create a pattern, do a trial fitting (or two, or three...) until we get it right, and then stitch up a pair of jeans that fit you just how you like them. You must redeem this perk in person at our new Chicago shop. Appointments are required.
Contribute $1000 or more and we'll make a custom corset for you OR we'll coordinate your wedding day.

Wearing a custom corset is like getting a nice hug all day long; everything is supported; you are comfortable; and all the right curves are highlighted. We'll start by talking about what you want, come up with a design you love, complete a trial version to test the fit and style, and finally handmake your corset right in our new shop. If you aren't in Chicago, that's ok - you'll just need a crafty friend to take accurate measurements and help with fittings. This perk includes shipping within the continental United States; shipping to other locations is at your expense.
OR
We'll coordinate your wedding day! Our day-of-coordination service includes two planning meetings, a visit to your venue(s) prior to the wedding, review of all vendor contracts and confirmation of vendor services in the weeks ahead of the big day. We will manage your rehearsal and be available for the entire day of your wedding to coordinate every last detail so you can enjoy it stress-free. Subject to availability; travel fees apply to weddings outside the Chicago metro area.
Contribute $3,000 or more and we will create a custom wedding gown or any other garment for you.

We'll start by talking about what you want, come up with a design you love, complete a trial version to test the fit and style, choose fabrics together, and finally handmake your garment right in our new shop. You must redeem this perk in person at our new Chicago shop. Appointments are required.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>That’s basically the origin of slow.</b>  There was a deep realization within each of us that it was
time to recapture the mindset of <b>slow</b>… since this moment, we have tried
to focus on what’s really important in life and enjoy everything we do. It’s
fair to say that we developed <b>slow</b> for ourselves, but we soon realized
that many had the same feelings. The overwhelming support for this concept
strengthened our conviction that creating a brand which reflects these values
is exactly the right thing at the right time.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The <b>slow</b> watch is a subtle reminder that time is the most precious
thing we have so we should enjoy everything we do and stop chasing every
minute.   In order to be a true symbol of this idea, the <b>slow</b> watch has
only one hand that rotates once every 24 hours. It actually moves at half the
speed of a normal watch, but allows you to see the progress of your entire day
at a glance. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We started the brand last year with our first model.

While we were hanging out at school we were talking about the big step we're about to make (entering college) and how important it was for people to be enterprising and not just to think about cool things and projects, but to make them happen. Why bracelets?Most of all the girls and boys our age wear bracelets all the time, but not always have a bottle opener or a key holder, this is why we want to design custom fashion bracelets with more functions than decorative use only.We want to create a line of fashion plastic and rubber bracelets with original functions and designs.Picture it!If you help us fund this idea, we will create the first line of multifuctional bracelets. There are times when you keep your earphones in your pocket and later when you take them out, they are all entangled , now imagine that you have an earphone saver in your left arm. You take out your amazing bracelet and you transform it in a usefull earphone saver.We already have some ideas for the different uses we can give to the bracelets.1) bottle opener bracelet2) earphones saver bracelet3) cell usb bracelet4) dock cellphone holder bracelet (for the office netflix time)5) key holder bracelet 6) mini post it bracelet (to not forget important ideas)7) ipod nano bracelet 8) car cellphone holder bracelet9) hot or cold bottle holder bracelet10) aux cable bracelet So basically
We want to create a line of fashion plastic and rubber bracelets with original functions and designs.------------------------------------------------------------The #PMFB Team!!Carla E. GaitanFB: https://www.facebook.com/carla.e.gaitan?fref=ts

<h3><span style=""font-size: 2em;"">Passionate about design</span></h3>
<p>We are Stephan, Matyas and Alina and are passionate about design! That is why a short while ago we have opened B1, an international centre for contemporary design in Prague, Czech Republic.</p>
<p>We have lots of ambitions, ranging from international exhibitions to supporting young designers. And the last one is what we actually like best.</p>
<p>We meet many young designers with great potential suffering from lack of attention and support. And we believe that it is a real pity that their individual collections are not being seen by the wider public. There are many reasons for that. Designers, however great, should design. But to create their own brand needs more, a lot more. So we are working out a program to ensure that these collections get seen and bought.</p>
<p>We give them free space for exhibitions, we assist in completing the process: from prototype to production to marketing &amp; sales. We want to be the platform that makes their dreams comes true. <img alt=""B1 - our idea(l)s"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/875726/pictures/full/20130617050224-Principles.jpg?1371470547"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/> </p>

<h1>Tokio - the knitted carpet</h1>
<p>TOKIO is a knitted structured carpet freshly born in Pauline Gorelov's textile research lab. Very light and quickly produced, the carpet is still as dense as the best hand tufted classic rugs. A wise combination of natural wools and technical fibers makes the carpet very soft and resistant at the same time. The delicate color range and the 2/1 traditional tatami proportions pay homage once again to the inspiring craft and design from Japan.</p>
<p><img alt=""20130528105702-tokio-rug-paulinegorelov-01"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/836022/primary_pictures/full/20130528105702-TOKIO-rug-PaulineGorelov-01.jpg?1369763825"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Revolutionary technique - Planet friendly design</h1>
<h2><img alt=""Pauline"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/875780/pictures/full/20130617061005-moi.jpg?1371474608"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></h2>
<p>As Pauline describes it:</p>
<p><em>“ Machine knitting is not being used for carpet production while it has various advantages: it’s much faster than the traditional tufting and weaving techniques and the starting costs are insignificant, which allows the production of small and custom series as well as bigger ones. The specific patterns I created for it give to the structure its thickness with a very small amount of material because it stores a lot of air.”</em></p>
<p>Tokio’s knitted structure ensures that the carpet is significantly lighter than any other rug without loosing it’s density!</p>
<p>Its weight of approximately 1,25 kg per sq.mtr. means that it needs significantly less material in comparison to other carpets. Another side effect of the low weight is lower carbon emissions for transportation. And for you, it makes it easier to move it around your office or home.</p>
<p>It is also a relative fast production process. A carpet of 100 x 200 cm only takes an hour to be knitted. We believe that is a very energy efficient method and we plan to find this out in more detail.</p>
<h1>Sizes, colors, yarns</h1>
<p>Tokio is available in various standard sizes to unlimited length – at this point in time the maximum width is limited to 100 cm.</p>
<p>Together with Pauline we have prepared various standard sizes:</p>
<p>The <strong><em>pixel</em></strong> (40x40cm), <strong><em>pigmy</em></strong> (40x55cm) and <strong><em>kawai</em></strong> (40x70cm) will make your cat or dog very happy. It is also great to put it under your desk or in front of your favorite chair where it will keep you feet stylishly warm.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>small runner</em></strong> (55x105cm) and <strong><em>big runner</em></strong> (70x150cm) great for bed side and in corridors.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>tatami</em></strong> (100x200cm) is the size with which it all started. A perfect size for most living rooms, proving a special touch to your interior.</p>
<p><strong>You want your Tokio carpet even longer?</strong> <br/>We have made it easy for you to find out your custom size price (longer than 200 cm) – standard width 100 cm: <br/>(Width) 1,0 mtr. x Length in mtrs x €250 + transport (EU €40, rest of world €70) = funded price</p>
<p>We use high quality yarns with a mix of 25% wool &amp; angora and 75% acrylic. This combination provides an excellent resistance for rugs while still being soft, thick and airy.</p>

We are Stephan, Matyas and Alina and are passionate about design! That is why a short while ago we have opened B1, an international centre for contemporary design in Prague, Czech Republic.
We have lots of ambitions, ranging from international exhibitions to supporting young designers. And the last one is what we actually like best.
We meet many young designers with great potential suffering from lack of attention and support. And we believe that it is a real pity that their individual collections are not being seen by the wider public. There are many reasons for that. Designers, however great, should design. But to create their own brand needs more, a lot more. So we are working out a program to ensure that these collections get seen and bought.
We give them free space for exhibitions, we assist in completing the process: from prototype to production to marketing & sales. We want to be the platform that makes their dreams comes true.  
 
Tokio - the knitted carpet
TOKIO is a knitted structured carpet freshly born in Pauline Gorelov's textile research lab. Very light and quickly produced, the carpet is still as dense as the best hand tufted classic rugs. A wise combination of natural wools and technical fibers makes the carpet very soft and resistant at the same time. The delicate color range and the 2/1 traditional tatami proportions pay homage once again to the inspiring craft and design from Japan.

Revolutionary technique - Planet friendly design

As Pauline describes it:
“ Machine knitting is not being used for carpet production while it has various advantages: it’s much faster than the traditional tufting and weaving techniques and the starting costs are insignificant, which allows the production of small and custom series as well as bigger ones. The specific patterns I created for it give to the structure its thickness with a very small amount of material because it stores a lot of air.”
Tokio’s knitted structure ensures that the carpet is significantly lighter than any other rug without loosing it’s density!
Its weight of approximately 1,25 kg per sq.mtr. means that it needs significantly less material in comparison to other carpets. Another side effect of the low weight is lower carbon emissions for transportation. And for you, it makes it easier to move it around your office or home.
It is also a relative fast production process. A carpet of 100 x 200 cm only takes an hour to be knitted. We believe that is a very energy efficient method and we plan to find this out in more detail.
Sizes, colors, yarns
Tokio is available in various standard sizes to unlimited length – at this point in time the maximum width is limited to 100 cm.
Together with Pauline we have prepared various standard sizes:
The pixel (40x40cm), pigmy (40x55cm) and kawai (40x70cm) will make your cat or dog very happy. It is also great to put it under your desk or in front of your favorite chair where it will keep you feet stylishly warm.
The small runner (55x105cm) and big runner (70x150cm) great for bed side and in corridors.
The tatami (100x200cm) is the size with which it all started. A perfect size for most living rooms, proving a special touch to your interior.
You want your Tokio carpet even longer? We have made it easy for you to find out your custom size price (longer than 200 cm) – standard width 100 cm: (Width) 1,0 mtr. x Length in mtrs x €250 + transport (EU €40, rest of world €70) = funded price
We use high quality yarns with a mix of 25% wool & angora and 75% acrylic. This combination provides an excellent resistance for rugs while still being soft, thick and airy.

NOTES: 
Regarding the colors: we try to accurately represent the colors available. But the color of products in person may differ slightly from how they appear here.
Tokio is an manufactured product, but it's finished by hand so the mentioned sizes can differ slightly with the final size we will deliver.

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">TUNEfootwear</h1>
<p>My name is Mike Norris and I'm the guy you see in the video.  My story is simple.  I started TUNEfootwear in 2011 because I really believe in order to maintain a healthy body, you need to have healthy feet.  I also believe that minimalist footwear is synonymous with healthy footwear.  I first ran in minimalist footwear in 2009, and I've never looked back.  Once I made the transition to minimalist running shoes, I couldn't help but realize that, on a daily basis, my dress loafers caused more pain, discomfort, and harm to my feet than any other shoes I owned.  They were too narrow and stiff, with too much heel, and not enough feel!  <br/></p>
<p>At the time I worked for a company with a strict business dress code.  Everyday at work I felt like I was banging my head against the wall because I was wearing these shoes that were killing my feet!  With no minimalist dress shoes available at the time, I decided it was time to take action and TUNEfootwear was started!<br/></p>
<p>As a small company our biggest problem is getting our product in front of our target audience.  We had to think outside the box to come up with an affordable and effective way to reach our customers.....so what did we come up with??? </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Dudes in Suits Campaign</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Late last summer I had to wear test our final prototypes for fit, comfort, and structural integrity before giving the green light to start our production run. I thought the best way to conduct a wear test would be to run in the loafers. At first, I thought there's no way I could run in a pair of loafers. Despite my doubts, I set out on a short run.  After about one mile, I not only realized it was possible to run in the loafers, I realized it was comfortable, too! That's because our loafers possess all the characteristics of a minimalist shoe, and they allow your feet to do the work. My mind started racing with ideas, and one of the first things I thought of was racing in TUNE loafers while decked out in a full suit and tie...and so the Dudes in Suits Campaign was born.  </p>
<p>I got to do what I love most, run, while promoting our new brand, TUNEfootwear, at a very low cost.  We participated in 10 races across the nation.  I was able to reach thousands of potential customers because you get a lot of attention racing in a suit and loafers.</p>

<p>The underlying idea behind minimalist footwear is that your feet can cope without the support and cushioning of a traditional shoe.  A minimalist shoe won't impede your stride or posture, which helps promote natural movement and stronger feet.    </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Step in TUNE!</h2>
<p>Step in TUNE is our new campaign to promote healthy feet by getting people in healthy footwear!  This is the same campaign we'll be promoting next year at the trade shows if our Indiegogo project is a success. Healthy footwear allows your feet to FUNCTION naturally.  Here are the underlying principals, and the characteristics that set TUNEfootwear apart from your traditional loafers. </p>
<p><b>FEEL - </b>Our outsole/insole design puts less than 15mm between you and the ground. This allows your foot to feel the ground and will naturally encourage you to pick up your feet instead of exerting extra force in every stride.  It's this extra force that can lead to painful injuries and degenerative arthritis later in life.  Feeling the ground reminds you to LIFT your feet.</p>
<p><b>FLEXIBILITY</b> - Your feet are extremely dynamic and are supposed to rotate through a full range of motion in every stride you take.  Tying a shoe with a stiff outsole to your foot is like putting a splint on your foot. It will prohibit the full range of motion and cause muscles to atrophy.  TUNEfootwear's flexible outsole allows your foot to rotate through its full range of natural motion in every step you take. </p>
<p><b>FLAT </b>- Our flat, or neutral, outsole design has no heel and has a minimal affect on your natural stride and posture.</p>
<p><b>FIT</b> - Our wide fit allows your foot to spread out, as it should, every time it hits the ground.  This wide design can help prevent several major crippling foot disorders.  </p>

Step in TUNE Campaign T


TUNEfootwear
My name is Mike Norris and I'm the guy you see in the video.  My story is simple.  I started TUNEfootwear in 2011 because I really believe in order to maintain a healthy body, you need to have healthy feet.  I also believe that minimalist footwear is synonymous with healthy footwear.  I first ran in minimalist footwear in 2009, and I've never looked back.  Once I made the transition to minimalist running shoes, I couldn't help but realize that, on a daily basis, my dress loafers caused more pain, discomfort, and harm to my feet than any other shoes I owned.  They were too narrow and stiff, with too much heel, and not enough feel!  
At the time I worked for a company with a strict business dress code.  Everyday at work I felt like I was banging my head against the wall because I was wearing these shoes that were killing my feet!  With no minimalist dress shoes available at the time, I decided it was time to take action and TUNEfootwear was started!
As a small company our biggest problem is getting our product in front of our target audience.  We had to think outside the box to come up with an affordable and effective way to reach our customers.....so what did we come up with??? 
Dudes in Suits Campaign

Late last summer I had to wear test our final prototypes for fit, comfort, and structural integrity before giving the green light to start our production run. I thought the best way to conduct a wear test would be to run in the loafers. At first, I thought there's no way I could run in a pair of loafers. Despite my doubts, I set out on a short run.  After about one mile, I not only realized it was possible to run in the loafers, I realized it was comfortable, too! That's because our loafers possess all the characteristics of a minimalist shoe, and they allow your feet to do the work. My mind started racing with ideas, and one of the first things I thought of was racing in TUNE loafers while decked out in a full suit and tie...and so the Dudes in Suits Campaign was born.  
I got to do what I love most, run, while promoting our new brand, TUNEfootwear, at a very low cost.  We participated in 10 races across the nation.  I was able to reach thousands of potential customers because you get a lot of attention racing in a suit and loafers.

The underlying idea behind minimalist footwear is that your feet can cope without the support and cushioning of a traditional shoe.  A minimalist shoe won't impede your stride or posture, which helps promote natural movement and stronger feet.

Und sehr schnell festgestellt, daß nicht nur ihre Kinder Gefährten brauchen, die ihnen das Leben etwas leichter machen. </p>

<p>Aber wir wollen auch noch kleine und große Taschen, kleine Reißverschlußtaschen (für die Windel, die Feuchttücher und den Reserveschnuller für unterwegs zum Beispiel) oder Schultertaschen für den Ausflug entwickeln. Außerdem Lätzchen, Bodies und Wickelunterlagen  und, mit Eurer Hilfe und Euren Anregungen, auch noch viele andere Dinge, die zur Fann-Familie passen und das Leben einfacher und entspannter machen.</p>

<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>We’ve designed the Fanns to be resilient yet cuddly so they can put up with a lot
and go through thick and thin with you. Obviously, you can wash the Fanns when
they get dirty or when they’ve been loved a little too much. Just don’t dry-clean,
tumble-dry or iron them - they’re really not too keen on that.</span></p>

<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The Fanns are made from 65% cotton and 35% linen, a fabric manufactured in
compliance with the OEKO-TEX Standard 100. In other words, the fabric contains
absolutely no harmful substances, so you can play, cuddle and relax with them in
total peace of mind. </p>

Dürfen wir vorstellen: Die Fanns - Kissen mit Charakter!



Molly, Buster, Lester, Fred und Carl sind eine neue Generation von Kissen für Kinder, Erwachsene und alle dazwischen!
Kissen? Nur Kissen? Nein, auch Spielzeug! Und Gefährte! Und Freund! Die Fanns sind immer für Euch da.
Das ist Molly






Molly ist die Kuschelige. Sie gibt Dir Sicherheit, ist ganz beruhigend und kommt überall mit hin. Und sie hält die Fanns-Bande zusammen - denn eine muß es ja machen!
Molly ist ca. 27 cm groß und mit ausgestreckten Armen etwa 30 cm breit.


Das ist Carl

Carl ist der Leidenschaftliche, der Lieb-Haber. Du kannst toll mit ihm streiten oder Deinen Frust an ihm auslassen. Danach gehts Dir wieder besser, weil Carl kann ganz toll trösten.

Carl ist ca. 25 cm groß und mit ausgestreckten Armen etwa 32 cm breit.

Das ist Lester

Lester ist der weltbeste Umarmer, einer, der Dich nie im Stich läßt. Denn mit seinem langen und starken Arm hält er Dich immer fest.

Lester ist ca. 26 cm groß und mit ausgestreckten Armen etwa 28 cm breit.

Das ist Fred

Fred ist die treue Seele der Fanns! Fred erlebt gerne jedes Abenteuer mit Dir und denn er kommt überall mit hin. Bei Fred kannst Du Dich ganz toll ausruhen.


Fred ist ca. 26 cm groß und mit ausgestreckten Armen etwa 34 cm breit.

Das ist Buster

Buster ist der Beschützer der Fanns! Mit seiner breiten Persönlichkeiten kann er alles von Dir ab- und jede Deiner Stimmungen aushalten. Auf ihn kannst Du Dich verlassen.

Buster ist ca. 22 cm groß und mit ausgestreckten Armen etwa 49 cm breit.
Mehr Details zu den Fanns findet Ihr weiter unten.


So haben die Fanns angefangen

Eigentlich gibt es die Fanns schon seit drei Jahren. So alt ist Una, so alt ist Leon, die Tochter von Karsten und Tanja, der Sohn von Laura und Klaus. Beide kamen im Abstand von einer Woche auf die Welt und sind seitdem die besten Freunde. So haben sich auch Laura und Karsten kennengelernt. Und sehr schnell festgestellt, daß nicht nur ihre Kinder Gefährten brauchen, die ihnen das Leben etwas leichter machen. 




Karsten ist Designer, Laura ist Managerin, damit war klar: Das machen wir zusammen! 

So soll es weitergehen

Die erste Auflage der ersten Fanns-Kollektion haben wir bereits produziert. Das Feedback, das wir für die Fanns bekommen haben und vor allem die Reaktionen der Kinder sind phantastisch: ""Endlich mal was anderes!"" ""Geben unsere Kinder gar nicht mehr her!"" Aber auch die Erwachsenen wurden bereits mit Fanns gesichtet - im Flieger, im Anzug und mit Buster an der Schulter bei einer gemütlichen, kleinen Ausruh-Pause.





Wir möchten die Fann-Familie nun in die Welt entlassen und sie weiter ausbauen. Das soll uns u.a. mit Facebook gelingen - und Facebook kostet Geld.  
Aber: Facebook ist für den Aufbau einer Fann-Community das perfekte Medium! Wir wollen die Fann-Familie mit Euch und Eurer Hilfe so groß wie möglich machen und den Spaß mit den Fanns mit allen teilen (und damit auch den Austausch untereinander fördern!)
Über Facebook wollen wir Euch neue Fanns vorstellen, Euer Feedback zu den Fanns hören und vielleicht sogar mit Euch zusammen neue Fanns entwickeln und designen.

Eure Hilfe ist nicht umsonst

Das sind unsere tollen Perks für Eure tolle Unterstützung:
Dankedankedanke! Das ist großartig! Wir werden der Welt verkünden, daß Du ein offizieller Fann-Fan bist! Auf unserer Homepage werden wir einen eigenen Bereich für alle Fann-Fans einrichten - und damit bist Du dabei!
Die Fanns schreiben zurück! Du bist ein besonderer Fann-Fan - denn die Fanns schreiben Dir offiziell und handgeschrieben zurück! Eine individuell beschriebene Postkarte geht direkt an Dich in die Post!
Ein Fann aus der Fann-Familie. Damit bist Du ein offizielles Mitglied der Familie! Du bekommst einen der Fanns aus der Familie versandkostenfrei geschickt - zusammen mit einer individuell beschriebenen Danke-Postkarte! Vergiss nicht uns zu schreiben, welchen Fann Du Dir ausgesucht hast! 
Sei der Erste - ein Early-Bird-Fann. Du gehörst zu den Ersten! Dieser Fann ist so noch nicht zu haben - wir heben ihn uns für später auf. Oder für Dich. Finley ist ein early bird - der erste Fann mit einer kleinen Tasche auf dem Rücken für Schlüssel, Nuckel, Labels oder andere Kleinigkeiten. 


Der exklusive Kampagnen-Fann. Das gibts nur einmal, das kommt nie wieder! Diesen Fann haben wir nur für Euch designt: Die dicke Lucy in lila gibt es nur für diese indiegogo-Kampagne! Und dann nie wieder. Lucy wird also eine echte Seltenheit, sozusagen eine Rarität sein. 
Die ganze Familie. Alle Achtung, gleich die ganze Bande! Aber Du hast ja recht, man sollte sie eigentlich nicht trennen! Die ganze Familie - Molly, Lester, Buster, Carl und Fred kommen versandkostenfrei als ein Paket zu Dir!
Die ganze Familie und Lucy. So sind sie fast alles versammelt: Die ganze Fann-Familie und Lucy, der Kampagnen-Fann - das wird es so nie wieder geben! Diese sechs Fanns werden sich bei Dir häuslich einrichten: Molly, Lester, Buster, Carl, Fred und Lucy! 
Ein individuell designter Fann als Sonderanfertigung. Das ist wahrhaftig ein Einzelstück! Wir designen Dir einen eigenen Fann, ein Unikat, das nur Du hast: Dein ganz eigener Fann!
Ein Fann wird heißen wie Du. Wir benennen einen Fann nach Dir - einen Fann, den wir in zweiter Generation bringen werden. Denn das hast Du Dir auch wahrlich verdient! Dazu erhälst Du, quasi als Einstimmung, natürlich auch die ganze Familie - denn schließlich gehörst Du nun ja dazu! 
Design your own Fann. Wir wissen - Du hast Geschmack und ein wahres Händchen für die Fanns! Du weißt, wie sie ticken und was sie brauchen. Damit kannst Du auch einen eigenen Fann gestalten, den wir dann in der zweiten Generation auflegen werden. Dazu erhältst Du natürlich auch die ganze Familie! 


Ganz wichtig!




Eure Hilfe wird hier bei indiegogo durch paypal abgewickelt. Wenn Ihr keinen eigenen paypal-Account habt - kein Problem! Ihr könnt bei Paypal auch so mit Eurer Kreditkarte bezahlen. Wenn Ihr das auch nicht wollt, könnt Ihr einfach auf unser Konto (Garden Street Management UG, Konto 455 87 104, BLZ 100 100 10 oder IBAN DE 7310 0100 1000 4558 7104, BIC PBNKDEFF (Postbank)) überweisen. Ihr müßt uns nur eine entsprechende Mail dazu schreiben (an karsten@fanns.de), wir lösen dann den von Euch gewählten Perk aus und ordnen alles entsprechend zu.
Bei Fragen oder Anregungen oder Kommentaren oderoderoder schreibt uns einfach an karsten@fanns.de! Wir werden uns dann so schnell wie möglich bei Euch melden!


Wir planen noch mehr


Natürlich planen wir noch weitere Kollektionen mit neuen Fanns! Der early-bird-Fann nur ist ein Beispiel davon - er hat eine kleine Tasche auf dem Rücken für die allerallerwichtigsten Dinge, die man nie verlieren darf. Zum Beispiel Schnuller, zum Beispiel Haustürschlüssel.
Aber wir wollen auch noch kleine und große Taschen, kleine Reißverschlußtaschen (für die Windel, die Feuchttücher und den Reserveschnuller für unterwegs zum Beispiel) oder Schultertaschen für den Ausflug entwickeln. Außerdem Lätzchen, Bodies und Wickelunterlagen  und, mit Eurer Hilfe und Euren Anregungen, auch noch viele andere Dinge, die zur Fann-Familie passen und das Leben einfacher und entspannter machen.



Wir freuen uns auf Eure Ideen!






Sie sind Einzelhändler/Kooperationspartner oder wollen einen eigenen Fann für Ihr Unternehmen?


Natürlich haben wir besondere Konditionen für Einzelhändler! Sprechen Sie uns einfach an!
Sie wollen einen Corporate-Fann für Ihr Unternehmen? Darüber würden wir uns natürlich sehr freuen! Schreiben Sie eine Mail an karsten@fanns.de, wir haben dazu sehr viele Ideen!


Noch ein Wort zu den Fanns


Wir haben die Fanns robust und trotzdem kuschelig designt, damit die Fanns auch tatsächlich allem standhalten und überall mit hin können. Wenn sie dreckig werden oder zu doll geliebt werden, könnt Ihr die Fanns natürlich auch waschen. Nur - bitte nicht chemisch reinigen lassen oder in den Trockner oder bügeln, das mögen sie nicht so gern.







Die Fanns sind aus 65% Baumwolle und 35% Leinen, einem Stoff, der nach dem Öko-Tex-Standard 100 produziert wurde. Das bedeutet, daß nichts im Stoff enthalten ist, was irgendwie schädlich sein könnte. Und das heißt - entspanntes Spielen, Kuscheln und Ausruhen nach Lust und Laune.


Da ist noch etwas:
Besucht uns auf http://www.facebook.com/diefanns ... schenkt uns ein Like, teilt unsere Seite, folgt uns ... wir freuen uns über jeden Besuch!



Molly, Carl, Fred, Buster, Lester und wir sagen Danke!
Wir freuen uns sehr über Eure Unterstützung und sind Euch sehr, sehr dankbar. Wir sind sehr gespannt und hoffen, daß Euch die Fanns genauso viel Spaß machen wie uns!

The Fanns write back! You are truly are special Fann-Fan! Because the Fanns are writing back offically and handwritten! A handwritten postcard is in the mail for you.


A Fann from the Fann-Family. You are an official member of the family! You will get one of the Fanns - together with a handwritten thank you postcard. Please don´t forget to write which Fann you have decided for.

Be the first - a Early-Bird-Fann. You are one of the first! This Fann will come later - but not for you! Finley is a early bird - the first Fann with a little pocket on his back for keys, pacifiers or other little things.


The exclusive campaign-Fann. This Fann is designed only for you and only for this indiegogo-campaign: Big Lucy in purple will be a real rarity! 


The whole family. Ok, everybody. But you are right, they should not be separated. 
The whole family and Lucy - it will never be like this again: Molly, Lester, Buster, Carl, Fred und Lucy! 
A customized Fann as a special model. There can be only one! We design and produce your own Fann and for you only. And he will be the only one of its kind.
We will name a Fann after you. A Fann of the next generation will carry your name. And you deserve it! Of course you will also get the whole family. After all you are a part of us now!
Design your own Fann. We know - you love them. You know them. So you will  design the next Fann which will be part of the official second generation. And of course you will also get the whole family. 
Important!







You don’t have your own paypal account? Not a problem! You can pay with your
credit card via paypal, too. If you don’t like that option, either, you can simply
transfer the money into our account  (Garden Street Management UG, Konto 455 87 104, BLZ 100 100 10 oder IBAN DE 7310 0100 1000 4558 7104, BIC PBNKDEFF (Postbank)). 








All you have to do is send us a corresponding email (to karsten@fanns.de), so we can match all
the information and get your requested perk on its way to you.








For any questions, ideas or comments, just drop us a line at karsten@fanns.de and
we’ll be in touch as soon as possible! 





We´ve got more in store






Of course we’re planning more collections with new Fanns, such as the Early Bird
Fann, who comes with a little backpack for those essential things that you simply
cannot afford to lose. Like your kid’s pacifier or your keys, for example.

Moreover, we are also planning to design and produce small and big bags, zipped
pouches (for a nappy, wet wipes and the spare pacifier for when you’re out and
about) or shoulder bags for that day out, bibs, onesies and nappy changing mats.
And with your help, we are sure we’ll come up with even more additions to the Fann
Family to make life easier and more relaxed. 






We are looking forward to your ideas!
 
Are you a retail/cooperation partner or would you like your own corporate Fann?






Of course we offer special rates for retailers, so simply contact us for a
quote!

Would you like your company’s very own Fann? We would be delighted to show
you our exciting ideas - just send us an email at karsten@fanns.de! 





Just another few words about the Fanns







We’ve designed the Fanns to be resilient yet cuddly so they can put up with a lot
and go through thick and thin with you. Obviously, you can wash the Fanns when
they get dirty or when they’ve been loved a little too much. Just don’t dry-clean,
tumble-dry or iron them - they’re really not too keen on that.










The Fanns are made from 65% cotton and 35% linen, a fabric manufactured in
compliance with the OEKO-TEX Standard 100. In other words, the fabric contains
absolutely no harmful substances, so you can play, cuddle and relax with them in
total peace of mind. 




One more thing:
Visit us on http://www.facebook.com/diefanns ... like us, share, follow us ... any help, any visit is appreciated!
Molly, Carl, Fred, Buster, Lester and all of us say Thank you!







We are very looking forward to your support and are immensely grateful to you.
Let’s hope you will enjoy the Fanns just as much as we do!",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Shopping for jeans is a necessary evil.  You try on dozens of pairs before you finally find the perfect fit - you know, the pair that hugs you in all the right places and feels like a second skin? You wear them all the time, they make your butt look <b>amazing</b>, you fall in love, it's like they <i>know</i> you.  Then one day, you put a foot through a distressed area, or blow a hole in the knee.  Devastated.  The only feeling that could describe your future without your favorite pair of jeans.  The only thing worse is imagining the hunt for a pair that might even come close to replacing them.  </p>
<p>I'm Jennifer Fagan, and I have been a life long lover and wearer of denim . If you are anything like me, you have a beloved graveyard of booty fabulous jeans and jean skirts that you
just <b><i>can't bear</i></b> to get rid of. You dream of the day some fashionable
solution will appear to restore them to their previous state of fabulosity (that won't make you look like a hobo).</p>
<p>One morning I was putting on my beloved $200 Hudson
distressed jeans when I put my toe through one of the
distressed holes and ripped them for the last time. After swearing up a storm, I thought, ""<i>This is
ridiculous! There must be a way to repair this and make them look
distressed.</i>"" So, i went to work on solving that problem...and what journey it has
been! Initially I had a manufacturer distress yards and yards of denim, until I
realized that destroying something to make something else doesn't sit well with me. </p>
<p>I began looking  into
various ways to create the look of distressed threads, and even <i>built myself a
loom</i> out of PVC pipes.  I was on a quest to find the best way to produce what has now
become Tatter Patch - the first ever iron-on designer threaded inner-patch that
you can use to repair, revive or restyle your favorite denim, giving them a vintage
distressed look in under 5 minutes. </p>

It’s made for those who are comfortable keeping things elegantly simple.Perfect for carrying everyday essentials including your laptop, camera and other items without compromising style.It features adjustable padded shoulder straps for extra comfort, dedicated zip compartment to hold a 15-inch laptop, two quick access zip pockets on both sides, an internal deep zip pocket that fits an iPad , top and side leather handles.Not All Backpacks Are Created Equal!Backpacks can be bulky, heavy, packed with unnecessary features or simply have no style or elegance.A common misconception amongst backpack makers that adding more features is better! The truth is that with more features, quality and style is principally tolerated!Surely we get excited about features but soon this excitement fades! Trend Fades, Style is Forever!Functionality is not about adding more features, it’s about removing unnecessary ones!Simplicity is way of life for people who believe that less is more! The Designer Backpack is merely a reflection of that thought and lifestyle.We focus on quality of materials, shape and style, functionality and handcraft excellence, and that we believe makes us different! The Designer Backpack - Master Edition * Free Delivery on all perks except of the Leather Laptop Sleeve.* All our products include a 1-Year warranty.Traditional Retail MarkupsThe price you pay in traditional retail stores is marked up several times!How? Between the cost of production and what comes out of your pocket generally pays for the following:Brand’s retail and distribution costs, excessive marketing expenses, licensing fees, reseller markups, margin and taxes and a little extra more for the brand name. We save you 70%We distribute our products directly to you from our partner manufacturer. We have no inflated marketing expenses, no middlemen, no retail costs and no markups.Realizing The Dream!Since my graduation back in 2001 as UIUX designer, i’ve always had this deep urge to create meaningful products that i can touch and feel with my own hands, but my professional life was always pulling me way from making this dream come true.A couple of years back while being in Istanbul for a short term project, i decided to start my own brand, where i can create beautifully designed, useful and authentic products and so i started otenteko.I set out to create a modern and comfortable leather backpack for everyday creative lifestyle, a backpack that looks great anytime, anywhere!Finding great leather from a reliable source was a challenge, luckily i was in Turkey, well known for producing the world’s finest natural leather with a heritage of craftsmanship that goes back to the 12th century.After months of research, i found a great leather producer and a bag manufacturer, the same manufacturer who makes leather goods for high-end brands. Our relationship has developed into friendship, they believed in our mission as much as we believed in their commitment to excellence from inception to delivery.There was a significant meaningfulness and pleasure felt at each stage of the production process, starting from concept design to sourcing leather, materials and hardware up until the final stages of delivering the first prototypes.Named to celebrate creativity and creatives around the world.

We appreciate every level of support, whether you are pre-subscribing for the limited-edition print, or simply want to help us preserve and sustain our fine-press studio.

We're very pleased to present our first limited edition print of our Sustaining Campaign, a stunning calligraphic tour de force from Julian Waters. Julian is world-renowned for his work, both commercial lettering, type design, and calligraphic fine-art. He continues the lineage of late German master calligrapher and type designer, Hermann Zapf. See  Wikipedia and Julian's Biography at Adobe.

The final design is now shown here, with Julian's elegant uncial script in red as counterpoint to the powerful fraktur. The quote ""Letters are Symbols which turn Matter into Spirit"" is one which resonates powerfully with all letter people! Calligraphers, type designers, typographers, printers and beyond!

We need your support to publish this fine edition, and to keep Slow Print/Driftless Book Arts going! 
Julian has generously provided this work in support of Driftless Letterpress and Book Arts Coop, and the funds raised (after production expenses) from this and future projects will be used to sustain the studio, improve the facilities, and retire outstanding obligations. We are planning a continuing series of similar collaborations from other extraordinary artists and designers.The edition is a gorgeous two-color design using Julian's personal ""fraktur"" script, which is rooted in his historical studies of the writing of the 16th century German writing master Johann Neudörffer. Limited to 150 total, of which 100 will be available to supporters, and the remainder will go to the artist and printer.  The Fraktur form is perhaps the epitome of the calligraphic form, with enormous vitality exhibiting the essential nature of the 'chisel-edge' pen written letter.

The Driftless Letterpress and Book Arts Cooperative was conceived to preserve the facilities, and provide access to qualified practitioners and students in the future. At this time, we are not yet incorporated, nor are we not-for-profit. Ongoing costs of the cooperative will be shared by the members, who will be encouraged to produce their own works in the facility.Funds may also be used to retire obligations to current shareholders.

There’s nothing worse than a scratched watch glass. Well, apart from a broken one! Which is why we’ve used the best quality sapphire crystal we could find. Second only to diamond in hardness, our crystals are clear and tough, giving you the best view of the dial and hands.It’s those tiny details that matter, which is why we made the decision that our watches would have not one, but two coatings of anti-glare on our wonderful crystals.

Both movements are gold plated, the Argo’s 7 series has 5 jewels and the Eclipse’s 1 series has 6.Jewels are used in place of bearings in the movement, not only to look great but to enhance the lifetime of the movement. Jewelled movements last longer and are more accurate than other, cheaper movements.Changing your watch battery every 6 months is a pain that you should not have to put up with. Our watches take either a Sony 321 or 364, providing each watch with 3 years worth of charge.Once we decided on stainless steel for our watch cases, the choice of 316L was simple.

The quality you would expect to see on a luxury watch.We’ve taken delivery of more than 80 different prototypes since those first versions landed on our desks in November 2017.In our quest for perfection, we wanted to be sure that every part was fit for the purpose it was designed for, and wouldn’t fail.We chose our manufacturing partners because of their experience in creating watches for some of the world’s most respected watch brands. We count on their experience, while the quality of their standards and attention to detail match our own.And the results are watches that we are extremely proud to put our name to.Our watches are crafted with an attention to detail bordering on obsessive. We did spend 18 months getting them from concept to prototype after all! And this attention to detail, coupled with our belief in simply doing things right, is at the heart of what we do.  Get the latest news, special offers and unique content on your favourite everyday watch on our social media channels.",60.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are working with local painters and carvers in India to bring to life six of the little known heroes from Hindu mythology before they get lost to time, including their amazing backstories. We worked to bring their looks up to date in modern toys, bringing the emotional impact of Western design to the intricate detail of Indian craftsmen. The result is that they are adorably lethal!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The toys are all made from local, sustainable materials by people who have their skilled craft going back for generations. The materials we use create museum quality pieces that can hold up to a child's rough play. We worked with the artisans to create designs that truly capture the heroes and add a new twist to them. These characters are so little known that even experts will likely learn something new about how the mythology all comes together.</p>

</div><div>
<p>We want to make these characters a reality, but as each toy is handmade, it costs a lot of money up front. That's where we need your help. Each toy is being fully handmade in a limited edition of 30, including the packaging and a card detailing the character's story.We are blind boxing each of the toys, which means we can keep the cost low and you get a surprise when you open it, just like your birthday! One out of every 5 toys is a special edition with extra vibrant colors and designs. You can also buy packs of blind boxes if you want a variety or to increase your odds. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you really have your eye set on one of the characters, we have the option to buy that as well, or the complete set (which your room or desk at work is really not complete without). There is also an extremely limited run of 10 sets of fully hand-carved versions of the characters that are truly stunning pieces of art. There are a few more variations you can get, leading up to a completely customized toy of you made by us. Find the ones that speak to you and we will make sure to put them aside for you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here are some samples of the toys themselves. These are just prototypes. The final versions will have the heads and bodies connected by magnets (so you can mix and match!) and some will have crowns connected by a little spring, so they wobble around.</p>

We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan, but sometimes forecasts don’t always hit the mark. Should we miss projections, we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible.
Supply Chain Risk
Component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we’ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></span></div></div>","Jars come in varying heights but spoons mostly come in the standard avg. 7 inch height. This makes it hard to leave a spoon in a jar to reuse. After scooping contents from a jar, we are forced to either discard the disposable spoon or wash the metal spoon each time. We wanted to rethink this and create a simple solution that could save resources.




What if there was a convenient way to use a single spoon for any jar? And that's how OneSpoon was born. OneSpoon is a BPA free food safe, dishwasher, microwave and freezer safe, one-size-fits-all spoon designed for reuse.


Over 30 Billion plastic utensils are used just in the US each year. This only grows many-fold across the world. Each OneSpoon could save on avg. 15-30 disposable spoons per jar or spoon washes respectively. Imagine what a million spoons could do! 
















Patent pending curve design avoids inadvertent breaking during regular use.











Each OneSpoon can save 15-30 disposable spoons or spoon washes depending on the size of the jar. Can you imagine how many resources a million OneSpoons can save?

We are raising these funds to invest in dual cavity molds, procure materials and most importantly to prove the interest in the concept. 
We're very excited for you to try OneSpoon and share it with your friends and family.

Because of its unique shape, it didn’t fit well in any of his bags. I asked if he’d like to go shopping for a new bag, but he replied: “No, I want the bag that Papa designs!” And so began the journey to make the perfect bag to carry the Switch around town.We designed a minimal bag with a focus on protection, accessibility, and quality materials that was just the right size to carry your Switch and a few daily essentials. The removable center divide not only protects your screen but it also holds 12 games. And because it’s removable it means your bag will have a life beyond the Switch, opening up the possibility to carry a variety of things -- even a mirrorless camera and a spare lens.We wanted to make sure this bag will be useful beyond the life of the Switch. What do you carry in your Switch Bag?An example of a fully loaded Switch Bag ready for travel. Contents: mobile phone, wallet, keys, USB type-c charger, passport and boarding pass, Nintendo Switch, and removable center divide with 12 Switch game cartridges!When you are not carrying the switch you can use your Switch Bag for a mirrorless camera and an extra lens. Many DSLR cameras also fit with a pancake lens and a spare normal prime lens. See our FAQ for more info!Deluxe / Pro / Standard — Express your style with a Séfu Switch Bag! Click this button or the one at the top of the page. Then choose your reward level. After the campaign you will choose your color and have the opportunity to purchase additional bags at the Early Bird rate!       The Standard Switch Bag and the Pro Switch Bag share these remarkable features:
Vegan friendly
Durable water resistant fabrics
Removable shoulder straps with 38mm webbing
Matte gunmetal hardware: including a custom tri-glide with an engraved Séfu logo

Protective foam
Extra strappy things: attach your bag to your belt or bike handles!
A photo of our custom matte gunmetal hardware that will ship with the Pro and Standard Switch Bags. They’re pretty similar to each other, so let’s break down the differences.*note, photo of pre-production unit. Final production uses matte gunmetal hardware, not shiny silver or shiny gold.Our Pro Switch Bag is made with 500D Cordura Brand Nylon 66 fabric, available in Black and Space Grey. The Pro bag also includes a layer of of Poron XRD Extreme Impact Foam along the sides and bottom. It is a no compromises bag that uses the best materials we could find.  The lid on the Pro Switch Bag uses two 25mm magnetic snap buckles. It’s a one-of-a-kind technology combining the advantages of strong magnets to make them easy to close and secure snap functionality to ensure a high locking force. Every version of the Switch Bag is easy to access, but the magnetic buckles on the Pro Switch Bag provide an extra level of security. The lid on the Standard Switch Bag uses simple magnets for closure. It’s the fastest solution for opening and closing your bag, and strong enough to keep your valuables inside. The 600D Polyester fabric and is available in fun color options. It uses standard EVA foam instead of Poron XRD. Both the Standard and the Pro Switch Bags include two strips of 38mm webbing with velcro on the back of the bag. Like the rug in The Big Lebowski, it just kinda ties the room together — but it’s not without its functionality!Take the velcro and attach it to your bicycle, or thread your belt through the loops and wear it as a fanny pack. Maybe attach some carabiners and hang it from your backpack? It’s up to you!Our Deluxe bag is made from a cowhide exterior and a lambskin interior. Each bag is hand-cut, hand-sewn, and hand-finished by skilled artisans. It features brass alloy hardware with a classic brass finish. At launch the bag will be available in three limited colorways. This is the perfect bag for the fashion conscious gamer. It's the kind of thing that will look better as it ages and with proper care can last a lifetime. Because it is hand-made our rate of production is limited, and so our reward tiers will be limited as well.Each bag is hand-cut, hand-sewn, and hand-finished by skilled artisans.

 Jakob has re-imagined the Native which is inspired by Copenhagen and the unpretentiousness of the Danish way of life.The re-modeled Native comes with invisible minute marks, because in Copenhagen, we don’t count the minutes, we enjoy quality time. We also bring you the Native Lille, a smaller 32 mm version for the female audience, in addition to the existing 36mm and 40mm watch faces. The new models will be available with white, blue and black dials, as well as a new gold and gunmetal case option, adding to the current silver and rose gold case colors.With every watch you are able to swap your straps out with a different one, allowing you to define how your express yourself and your outfits. Simply detach the straps on your watch, and you are ready to change to any style you are in the mood for.  


We are determined to contribute to sustainable change in the world. When you choose a watch, you are choosing one of three sustainable causes. Use the serial number on the back of your watch and the unique identification code from the Certificate of Authenticity to choose a cause and track the results on our website.
 
 Jakob Wagner is an award-winning designer with over 25 years of experience, working with the likes of Bang & Olufsen, Hay and Muuto. Nordgreen’s sustainable approach was one of the core reasons he chose to work with us: “What has become really important to me is to work solely on something… on conscious projects; ones that mean sustainability is a given. To make something that has intrinsic value and that we want to keep for a long time.”   Nordgreen Team In Copenhagen

Showcasing 7 brand new designs by cutting edge artists worldwide, the Micro Wallet is our slimmest, strongest design yet. Not only that, a portion of every pledge will go to support the artists collaborating with us. Join us in our mission to put beautiful art in every pocket.
 
 Micro Wallet is as small as a card when closed, yet fits up to 8 of them easily. A simple yet intuitive clam-style opening allows you to store and access your cards on-the-go with a flick of the wrist.
 
 We know you carry around some bills as well, so we designed an all-new cash compartment. And yes, it fits all kinds of bills.
 
 Micro Wallet starts out at just 0.3mm thicker than a standard credit card. We challenge you to find a slimmer wallet. 
 
 Micro wallet is made from one continuous piece of Tyvek® smart material with RFID seamlessly integrated into the fold which makes it virtually unrippable and highly resistant to wear & tear all while keeping your private electronic information safe from theft. Apart from being super-durable, the Tyvek® we use for Micro-Wallet is also water-resistant, so rain or shine, you know you’re protected. 
 Don’t worry about loading up your Micro Wallet with cash, cards, receipts, notes, or whatever else you fancy. It’s paper thin, but still expands over time while remaining beautiful and never compromising durability.
 
 When closed, Micro Wallet keeps your private data safe from electronic theft. The 360-degree RFID protection is built in so you won’t even notice it. Where did we fit it all in? Well, that’s our secret.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>    Frankie and Sue was started by two best friends who moved from the concrete streets of NY to the ocean side of LA. It is the product of two girls with a clear vision and desire to create a stylish, trendy and inventive clothing line for young girls. The name Frankie &amp; Sue derives from the combination of the owner’s middle names and is also a representation of two very strong personalities. Carol “Frankie” was the epitome of a tomboy with her blonde bowl cut and brother’s hand-me-downs. She liked to be comfortable and edgy, tough and trendy. Alicia “Sue” was the definition of a girly girl. Always in dresses, from her brown ringlets to her shiny bow shoes. She was head to toe “pretty and polished”. Frankie &amp; Sue prides itself on being sewn here not flown here having everything designed and constructed right here in the U.S. </p>
<p>    The money we raise here is going toward our showroom fee for our Spring 2013 Collection, Spring 2013 samples, &amp; Spring 2013 production. With the money we are able to contribute ourselves and the money we raise with all your help, we will be able to put together a wonderful 2nd season collection to really get Frankie &amp; Sue off the ground. This clothing company has been a dream of ours for the past 5 years and we are forever grateful for the love &amp; support to make this dream a reality. </p>
<p>     We are continually humbled by the overwhelming support we have received and cannot express how much this means to us. Frankie &amp; Sue is something that we both have poured our whole heart into and look forward to what the future holds.</p>
<p>    </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>    The amount that we need to raise here to really enable us to go forward with a well put together and professional collection is $8000. $$800-1000 of the goes toward the cost of renting a showroom in downtown LA fashion district for market week beginning the first week of August. By putting ourselves around all the top children’s brands it gives us the opportunity to be picked up by all the major high end boutiques here in LA and southern CA. $2000 is going toward the cost of our Spring 2013 Sample set. This money is divided up by patterning, cutting, grading, sewing, 1st sample, &amp; 2nd showroom sample costing. The other $5,000 goes toward what it costs us to produce these garments once the orders have been made to our factory in LA based on orders and commission. The process itself costs around 14-16,000.</p>
<p>    We have come up with some wonderful perks to those of you that are able to donate towards our clothing line. We are so appreciative of all your help that we are happy to be able to send your some wonderful Frankie &amp; Sue goodies. These perks include stickers, website shout outs, and items from our Fall 2012 collection.</p>
<p>    If we are unable to reach our final goal we will be putting the majority of the money into the sample sets for Spring &amp; Production. It is so very important that our samples fit properly, look professional, &amp; are exactly what we as the designers sought out to achieve aesthetically. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>    We completely understand that not everyone has the means to financially support right now. There are so many other ways that you could help spread the Frankie &amp; Sue love just by word of mouth. Tell your friends... your families.. coworkers... teammates.

<p><em><strong>FIRST:</strong></em>  Thank you for your interest in this project which I am very dedicated to.  I studied fashion at the UCLA Extension Program and with the love of travel and fashion of the 40's and 50's I started RetroWhere?.  With the direction and help from SCORE (Service Core of Retired Executives) I started the prototype/manufacturing process. My current buyers have told me that their customers who have already purchased my current designs are asking for more!

<p><em><strong>MY CURRENT BUYERS</strong></em> are all over California and Hawaii, including the Hyatt Regency Maui.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE STORY:</em></strong>  The inspiration for these handbags was my father's old suitcase with travel destination stickers on it.  When I was little that suitcase inspired me to see the world and experience other cultures.  I hope my line will do the same for others.  So being a creative person it popped into my head one day that that would be a great idea for a handbag because I know if I saw one, <em>I'd </em>want it!  So I started with a European version which, of course, is the<strong><em>""European Vacation""</em> </strong>design<strong> </strong>(destinations include: Rome, Paris, Great Britain, Venice, Suisse Air, Greece and Deutschland) and thought a tropical version would be great so I designed <strong><em>""Tropical Getaway""</em> </strong>(destinations include: Fiji, Hawaii, Tahiti with a brass logo tag and plumeria flower charm shown below).  I created a prototype and walked around with it to test it out. I am stopped all the time and asked ""I love your bag, where did you get it?""  </p>

</div></div>","FIRST:  Thank you for your interest in this project which I am very dedicated to.  I studied fashion at the UCLA Extension Program and with the love of travel and fashion of the 40's and 50's I started RetroWhere?.  With the direction and help from SCORE (Service Core of Retired Executives) I started the prototype/manufacturing process. My current buyers have told me that their customers who have already purchased my current designs are asking for more! More designs are on the sketch pad and I'm very excited to get them out as soon as possible. Quality, excellent service and professionalism for my buyers is paramount.
MY CURRENT BUYERS are all over California and Hawaii, including the Hyatt Regency Maui.

<span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">The current world is truly a melting pot of all cultures whose history and story we have yet to fully explore.  Similarly,  fashion is seen as just a trend or style, but it encompasses many cultural and historical aspects that the general public is not aware of. LeSueur LLC has developed the brand TLeSueur as a women's luxury clothing brand that fuses the elements of  historical dress  within various cultures and their art, and hsitory.  Our goal is to inspire you to learn, to unleash your imagination and to create a new experience; so, embrace your creative beauty, you inner explorer and let us help you become the work of art that you are.  </span><br/><br/> In 2011 TLeSueur created its first capsule collection and since then the company has continued to refine its brand and define niche within the fashion industry.  The brand strives to envision what luxury would look like if for example, the unique cultural dress of an Inuit tribe and a Mayan tribe were brought together; better yet lets add in a dash of darkness from the Spanish artist Goya.  What do we get?  Innovation.  The ideas above may seem incompatible, but that is the discovery of it all.  The brand not only seeks to innovate but to bring an element of social education to its consumers by motivating them to learn more about the ""fused"" inspiration behind what they are wearing.  Likewise, as a brand we are intent on helping other designers to achieve their dreams by providing design opportunities and creating a community in which they are able to network and find educational resources.<br/></span>

<p>Our passion for handmade wood furniture gave us the idea to incorporate 
wood into our favorite accessories like watches, sunglasses and wallets.
 The first products were a pair of bamboo sunglasses, bamboo wallet and a
 watch made entirely from wood. As a company we sought to create a brand
 that would set itself apart from the rest. Our designs are fashion 
forward pieces made to last while providing you with an exceptional look
 and feel. We spent the last 18 months working on designs, sourcing 
movements and making all the adjustments on final prototypes before we 
start our first production run. In order to turn these products into 
reality and send it into production, we need your support. It's your 
opportunity to get the first round of products at a remarkable discount.
 We need as many people as we can to raise their hand and tell the world
 about these amazing products. It's a great opportunity to be the first 
to own one of our trendsetting unique products. Show your support! Help 
us reach our goal...and look good doing it.<br/></p>
