<p>The game design of Vokabulantis is guided by a novel dogma we call Emotional Mechanics.</p>
<p>Everything in the game is designed to make you feel, what the characters feel. You are not being told what they feel, but you feel, what they feel, because of the game design. </p>
<p>Under that dogma rhythm based levels with a pumping beat spark irresistible joy as the protagonists just survived a life threatening mission. </p>
<p>Or your sudden ability to float kindles the feeling of relief having found each other again, when you thought all hope was lost.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>So happy you could fly? We are prototyping levels, that make you feel like anything is possible. The level designs are really there for you, they want you to succeed. It's gonna feel like bubbly joy!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other places the world opens itself up as you journey through it effortlessly, and you feel so confident, that you start to believe everything turns out the way you want it.</p>
<p>You can also experience much darker emotions, where each character is trapped alone in illogical split screens mirroring the insanity of your inability to connect with someone.</p>

We've been fortunate to have had some significant coverage and mentions of Vokabulantis already, so here's a small selection. 
 

Engadget article
GameRant article
GameSpot Article
Elijah Wood tweet
Patton Oswalt tweet 

 
Here's a mini doc where team members gets into what it's like working on Vokabulantis:
 


 



 
 
""I didn't take any formal education, but just build my own studio. So everything has always been possible to me in a sense. But this is really taking it to a new level. My field of art is literally evolving through this project. Never have stop motion been this dynamic and interactive. To be able to bring this to stop motion makes me so proud."" 
- Johan Oettinger - Stop Motion & Game Director

Vokabulantis is a love-driven co-op platformer adventure. The game is inspired by games like Inside, Unravel and Little Nightmares, yet it's made by hand. 
 

GAMEPLAY - Karla lends Kurt a hand
 
You enter Vokabulantis just as Kurt and Karla are about to say, what they feel for one another.
Actually they've just found themselves stuck in that moment unable to get a word out, and then suddenly they are thrown into Vokabulantis.
 

 
In Vokabulantis the kids must embark on an epic quest to save the world of language. If they fail, they will be stuck in that moment forever.
They may never get to say, what they want to say to each other.
 

Karla falls after she has just pulled the lever, that completes the tower top level
 
The game can be played as a single player or as a local co-op. It is expected for all major platforms, but thus far we can guarantee you a PC release, since it's a bit early to promise the whole thing. 
 

 
Full story playthrough of 6-8 hours of gameplay and an additional 2-4 hours if you hunt for all the hidden quirks and achievements of Vokabulantis.
 

 
Join Kurt and Karla in their struggle to restore peace to Vokabulantis - and to express their feelings for each other after their words have been taken away. 
And please join us one of these places or all of them!
 




 
 
 
 
 

 
The game design of Vokabulantis is guided by a novel dogma we call Emotional Mechanics.
Everything in the game is designed to make you feel, what the characters feel. You are not being told what they feel, but you feel, what they feel, because of the game design. 
Under that dogma rhythm based levels with a pumping beat spark irresistible joy as the protagonists just survived a life threatening mission. 
Or your sudden ability to float kindles the feeling of relief having found each other again, when you thought all hope was lost.

So happy you could fly? We are prototyping levels, that make you feel like anything is possible. The level designs are really there for you, they want you to succeed. It's gonna feel like bubbly joy!
 
Other places the world opens itself up as you journey through it effortlessly, and you feel so confident, that you start to believe everything turns out the way you want it.
You can also experience much darker emotions, where each character is trapped alone in illogical split screens mirroring the insanity of your inability to connect with someone.
 

Feeling alone? One of the Emotional Mechanics we are currently prototyping is a splitscreen mechanic, where you are isolated with each character, but you can try to manipulate the split screens to see, if you may find a way through the insanity. 
 
You also get to tap into the bond forming between the kids and their literal distance will start influencing the level.

Being aware of when you need closeness and when to give space are keys to any loving relationship. In Vokabulantis that becomes an actual game mechanic, where the actual distance between the players is part of the level design.
These emotional mechanics and many more are currently in development and we love to get to a place, where we can start showing them off to you for real! 
 

Within the emotional mechanic dogma, you'll also experience plenty relatable and recognizable ""classical"" platforming throughout the game - Kurt raises the rope Karla hangs on to by activating a word power zone
 

 
 
""You should get scared, laugh, cry, concentrate and be entertained out of your mind with Vokabulantis. Nobody thrives on a constant diet of sugar coated pop games. Your game intake has to be varied and mixed up, and I'm here to mix it up for you!""  
- Esben Kjær Ravn - Game Designer

We always start out by being a bit too dark, but these tests still came out nice enough for you all to see them. As you see below it's not all that sinister and dark.
 
Before we go deeper into the world of Vokabulantis Morten Søndergaard needs and introduktion. He is first and foremost an acclaimed poet and conceptual artist in his own right, but luckily he is also the story world writer and the poetic pillar of Vokabulantis. It's in his mind the deep dive into the language happens. It's from his writing we excavate the colorful creatures, story elements and environments of Vokabulantis.

""I've been exploring these poetic and complex language-philosophical questions for decades now. It's really dear to me and making it an emotionally riveting love story is something I didn't even know I dreamed of. And it's interactive - playable - magic on top!""
- Morten Søndergaard - Storyworld Writer & Poet

 
 
And now put on your earphones and listen to the sketches for the music of Vokabulantis by our wonderful multitalented Nicolas Vetterli, who is both doing audio and music for Vokabulantis.
That way you will enjoy the concept art below and get a better sense of how it will be to visit Vokabulantis.
 

CONCEPT ART: To save the Verbe Carbs Kurt and Karla must travel across vokabulantis. When they finally reach the lake of the Verbe-Carbs things are not what they seem.
 
 

CONCEPT ART: In Vokabulantis the most precious material is Word Crystal. Although the vast word-crystal mines are beautiful and bountiful, their ressources have been restricted since they became controlled by the Word Führer.​
 
 

CONCEPT ART: The City of Noun is a storage facility bigger than any city in our world. Here everything that has a name has a container in the container towers. The Kustodian of the city is an eccentric old robot with a few loose fuses.
 
 

CONCEPT ART: Deep in the old tunnels and caves of the Word Crystal mines Numeralia hides. She is the powerful Witch of Numbers - a fiery old femmes fatales or treacherously innocent child of all ages, but Kurt and Karla need her help.
 
 

CONCEPT ART: The Word Crystal refineries uses vast amounts of Wordpower. They corrupt and pollute Vokabulantis, but the Word Furher wants the refined Word Gasses and Word Oil to power his ambitions.
 

CONCEPT ART: The enormous and beautiful Verbe Carbs bring life and movement to everything in Vokabulantis. They are a vital part of the world or rather have been before. They are now cut off. The Word Führer’s waist has them cornered and out of influence.
 
 

CONCEPT ART: Traversing the Sea Of Time with the Verb Carps
 
 
CONCEPT ART: The Trailer Park Castle of the Color Prince - a character inspired equally by Axl Rose, David Bowie and adjectives
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
You get seamlessly in and out of cutscenes in Vokabulantis. This approach draws you close to the characters and their story.
 

An in game shift between gameplay and cutscene
 
It also ensures you see the stop motion up close and powers the game experience with the fact, that you are actually playing inside a real physical world. 
The hand crafted experience brings real life to the gaming and gaming to real life.

Handcrafted assets shown side by side with it's scanned and processed digital result.
 
There are two main focuses of the art development handcrafting/handanimation and digitization. Here's a brief introduktion to the various processes and crafts, that goes into making Vokabulantis.
 

Karla is being worked on
 
 
""When I build puppets I put so much time and love into them, and it's hard to let them go when handing them over to the animators. But here I'm able to ""animate"" them myself in a sense, when I play. It feels like I breath life into my puppets. And I simply love that.""​ 
- Ida Asferg Jakobsen - Head Of Workshop

 
 
 

This is photogrammetry in action. Photogrammetry is the technique we use to 3D scan handcrafted models.
 

In the studio we shoot each frame in the stop motion animation several times with different lightings. See why in the gif below...
 

With the extended process, when doing the stop motion photography described above, we are able to light our characters dynamically in the game engine, making them blend seamlessly in the environments of the game.
 

Cutscene that has been assembled and lit digitally from handcrafted set elements and stop motion animations.
 
Here follows a 5 step visualization of the process we have developed to maintain the crucial ability to change, tweak and improve the gameplay as far into the development as possible. 
We do this to be able to user test and iterate on the gameplay as in any purely digital game development.
This is core to us in Vokabulantis and good game design in general.
It has been a requirement for us, that handcrafted sets, puppets and animations go hand in hand with our ability to user test, tweak and improve in all steps of the production cycle.
 




 
 
 
 

  


 
Vokabulantis is made by a team of the most talented and experienced people from game development and stop motion animation. 
They work within the game development studio Kong Orange and the stop motion animation studio Wired Fly - the production company duo, that undertakes the development of Vokabulantis with poet and artist Morten Søndergaard as the third pillar in the production.
We work with top shelf stop motion talent, who are veterans of Aardman, Laika and Lego stop motion productions.
The development team has also launched several game titles between them, most notably Felix The Reaper for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, Mac and iOS.

Between these factors, and their ability to survive, the highlanders have forged their name in our memory. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622634969/lgv13ewyxfhgnca3jdtb.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622634991/sp9kchglgvpwplwzqhsb.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The Highlander Pack - <i>Exclusive Claymore Skin</i>, <i>plus all cosmetics from </i><i>the lower tiers. </i></p><p><u><strong>Followers of Woden</strong></u><br/>An elusive group of people not known by many, often seen bearing amphibious creatures on their shields and helms.

Players begin with nothing, gather resources, build a kingdom and fight to survive in the hopes of becoming renowned across the land. At its core, Renown is a first-person medieval fighting game, with a strong emphasis on competitive skill-based combat. Renown takes the most enjoyable and popular aspects from contemporary open-world survival games which include Building, Progression and Social Politics. These are then combined with close quarters, skill-based combat to create an immersive and engaging multiplayer experience. 
Fast-paced medieval survival with a strong emphasis on melee combat. 
From building humble farms to huge fortresses, the choice is with the player. 
A focus on horses, carts, and cavalry warfare. 
Group systems for making Claims, taking titles, giving ranks and more.
Server Progression and Wipe systems, for an engaging and vastly replayable experience. 
Tools for Community Hosts to help tailor their servers. Future plans for extensive moddability.
Functioning Combat Alpha waiting for players.
  The three main gameplay features which act as the pillars of Renown are:Whether you are new or experienced to the genre, we have designed the combat system with the player in mind.  This allows new players to easily learn the basics, while keeping much of the nuances from the games which inspired Renown. 

 
 Develop your skills as the game evolves and prove you’ve got what it takes to be a knight of Renown.We’re aiming for that close shave feeling in-game, including dragging, matrixing and all your favourite fighting features. We want players to look good and feel good. Armour in-game doesn’t just help when getting hit in melee but also deflects arrows and other throwables.  We plan on expanding and evolving horse movement, riding, and combat. A steady mount will help with many things from exploration, to logistics. The building system uses an easy-to-understand and deploy method. This allows for greater depth when creating both small and large castle or village-type structures. From a small house with only a door, players expand into fully customized castles, creating structures truly unique to the person's ability and experience.The building system uses a hybrid system of segmented and prefabricated placeable buildings. This allows players both build unique structures, while saving time on repeatable builds. From Farm to Fortress the choice is yours. We’re seeking to redefine how players build in a survival game. Not only will you need a safe place to horde all that loot you’ll be getting, but a strong and high wall is a weapon in its own right. Players will have access to industry buildings which aim to help increase the quality of life, by reducing the need for excessive UI clicking and Dragging actions. The raiding system represents the pivotal activity that all types of players can undertake in-game. What’s the point in building a great castle if you can’t level someone else's to the ground?In a way the players are always in an “Arms Race” to see who can build the strongest, smartest, and most awe-inspiring structures. We want to provide you with just as awe-inspiring weapons, siege engines and all the utilities required for an ongoing medieval war. We want to provide a range of options for “forcefully dismantling” the enemies defenses. From mighty engines of war, inspired by history’s great sieges, to simpler tools for the more subtle raider. We hope to provide the ultimate player vs player medieval siege experience.When combining the key features detailed above, with a wild world of social chaos, innovation and adaptation is key. Players will be required to create and employ increasing levels of tactics, collaboration, and skill, to stay ahead. We hope the create a truly unique experience with our raiding system. We are seeking to combine a new world of survival raiding, with the far older one told to us in the stories of history. There are several major elements of renown that are supported by the main game pillars. These systems help to shape the world into a desirable and fun experience. The following systems are not as visible to the player but are vital for core gameplay.We plan to have an extensive group/clan system to allow mighty empires to form. At the same time, we want smaller groups to survive and thrive. In the world of renown, resources are limited. It's not always the biggest and strongest who come out ahead. Another important element in Renown is the progression system. This system enables players to progress through four tiers of technology. These are aimed at being fun, not historically accurate, that said we take care to ensure as many elements of the game feel just right. Renown takes place in a fully immersive world. When a player logs off, they leave behind a sleeping character. The same is true for resources and gear. The game also uses a traditional system of regular server wipes to ensure fresh gameplay. What use are the spoils of war, if there’s no one left to fight? The cycle system ensures near-unlimited re-playability. Our primary goal here is to provide as much support to community server hosts. A survival game is made or broken by its community, and the tireless hosts who make it happen. We wish to provide the tools and options to make community servers feel unique and distinguished from each other. Our team are also huge fans of the modding community and we hope to give as much support as possible to aid modders with their creations. As avid fans of this genre, we asked ourselves, how can we fund the game while delivering something that players will enjoy? During our testing of the combat alpha, we discovered something. Our game is actually really fun, even without the bells and whistles of survival. So we decided on a modular approach. We've split our roadmap into 3 distinct sections. It should be noted, no matter how much funding success we can achieve, we're dedicated to the completion of this project.The first road map covers our $40,000 goal;From here we hope to open our Closed Combat Alpha. Donators who purchase Loyal Supporter will receive entry at this stage, due to helping fund the campaign right now.Any funds raised over our $40,000 goal will be utilized in the following roadmap. Our estimates suggest we'll need to raise roughly $180,000 to complete the next stage;From here we enter the final stage of development. This roadmap covers the major sections which govern the survival factors of the game. As such we've separated and dedicated this section to ensure we get it right.At this stage, our Steadfast Backers will be given access. It's possible we'll also be required to open the beta for later purchase, to help fund the next roadmap. Steadfast Backers can be assured that the price for donating now will be lower than at the later date.Our estimates suggest from the previous roadmap, we'll require roughly $360,000 to complete our final roadmap;Donators should understand that no matter our funding success, we'll be continuing progress on this game. That said any success over our goal line will greatly speed up and increase the quality of our work. Likewise, it'll allow our current team to better dedicate themselves as full-time developers. Disclaimer: These figures are our best estimates. It's possible that we may require further funding.The idea behind Modular development is double-sided. On the one hand, we're able to separate the major elements of the game and develop each with care and skill. Much more importantly for the testers, we hope to make it fun. Each module comes with its own game modes and maps to ensure the testing process is as enjoyable as possible. This will allow us to not only provide a fun game to play, but also a very clinical and sterile environment to run tests, and perfect each module before moving on. With your help we hope to use this approach to balance on the line, to provide not only a fun testing environment but also a quality game with key feedback and dedication.The combat in-game feels very fun at the moment. However, there’s still a long way to go. Likewise, it's missing all the polish such as gore and dismemberment, quality sound effects, and more importantly, it's using placeholder animations. The dueling module currently starts as a simple FFA server, which we've already created. Players will then be able to interface with another dualist to start a 1v1 fight locked from other players. It is absolutely crucial that Renown has a balanced and stable combat system. We hope to provide some fun duels and free for all fights for our players while they provide us with the highly important testing we need.Given that renown is to be a survival game, we’ll want to perfect how it feels to fight in groups. This module will feature a deathmatch mode, as 2 teams fight to the death. With the inclusion of our amour systems, and new weapons being added we think this should be pretty fun alone. That said it's also helping us replicate open-world fights between two groups both indoors and outdoors. This will allow us to “stress test” player counts, and work on balance when larger groups of players are involved. The raiding module is much like it sounds. Initially, we plan on building several “Base” replication maps. With these, we’ll run an epic simulation of what it could be like to raid in renown. This game mode will be round based, 2 teams will start in two opposing identical prebuilt castles, Inside each base, will be a limited amount of weapons, armour and siege equipment. The objective of this mode is to capture the enemy's banner deep inside their castle. This mode has a wide range of functions to test, and will likely be the longest overall phase of development. When you think about a survival game, there is a very clear progression. You start with nothing; you then farm items to create gear and a base. Then you fight others and you either survive or lose. We reckon this could be an extremely fun experience. More importantly its testing the most important area of the game, the main survival experience. Once we have settled on the intricacies of how our raiding system will work, we will begin introducing the rest of the survival features. The beauty of this raiding module is that we can effectively test the entire game play loop of the full game of renown in a short game mode. As previously mentioned, the raiding modules allow us to test the vast majority of renown’s gameplay loop in a contained and re-creatable environment. Once the building system is added, this opens a whole new area of testing. The system is also highly important for overall gameplay, so we want to get it right. This game mode will allow players to create whatever their heart desires without the need of farming resources or fighting. Depending on how well both the raiding and building modules function, the option for allowing players to build their own castles in the leeway period of the raiding mode could be introduced.  There are many tales told of the island. The one we know best is that of The Founding Few. Who were these great people? We know not anymore. All we have is their names, likeness and the story lore has left to us. Of which I shall now tell you. The Founder It is said, The Founder came first. No one knows, be it by day or night, or in what age they arrived. All we know, is they lit a beacon that brought a new age of prosperity. The Founder is titled double as such. Not only did they create a mighty empire here, but they literally founded the long passage to the island. Lost then and now again. Exclusive Founder Crowned Helm & Royal Gown plus all cosmetics from the lower tiers. Largest Customized Statue in the in game monument is dedicated to you, Personal Engraving The Founding CouncilThat said The Founder was not alone in their journey. With their being, came mighty companions. Those who would be remembered as the original Founding Council. We know not what roles they fulfilled, but we do know that their governance and advice lead to a time of great happiness for our people. However, as is it now, it was then. Times are not always happy and grand, our founders had it no different. Exclusive Councilor Crown & Royal Gown plus all cosmetics from the lower tiers. Medium Customized Statue in the In Game Monument, Personal EngravingChampions of the GuardThe Founding Guard were said to be, not only warriors of martial prowess but also diplomats, and skilled leaders in their own right. From this mighty number arose, The Champions of the Guard. We know these few, by their distinctive helm and crest, artefacts of which survive to this day. It's said the Champions of the Guard were sent as the personal representatives of the council and founder:- Be it to stand strong and inspire those around them in battle, or to calm civil unrest with their pure gravitas alone. The champions' renown is still felt to this day.Exclusive GrandHelm Skin, Exclusive Warhammer Skin, Customized Statue plus all cosmetics the lower tiers. The Founding Guard In the face of this darkness stood the fearsome Founding Guard. Again, beyond bold names and graven likeness, we know little of these brave warriors' exploits or martial prowess. We do know however that their grandeur and bravery endured the worst the island could throw at them, and they returned to tell us the tale. For they in turn had a mighty charge, to be a shield to the many heroes and fallen ancestors from this greater age. Exclusive Guard Bastard Sword plus all cosmetics the lower tiers. Small Customized Statue in the In Game Monument, Personal EngravingHeroes of the WallLet us speak of that number, some Heroes remembered on the wall. All were brave travelers with a grave to mark their toil. For these hardy folks, much was endured. And from such hardship came an empire which to this day lies in ruins. We do not forget their names, even if their stories and beings are but dust in the rain. Exclusive Heros Short Sword plus all cosmetics from the lower tiers. ,Customized Plaque on In game monumentFallen FounderThe many graves around our shrine, are the last we know of those who once lived here. Their stories forgotten in our time, but still, we ensure those graves shine.  Even though we don't know the tales of those brave travellers, their graves alone are testament to a shining soul. Fallen Founder Tier - Exclusive Cloak plus all cosmetics from the lower tiers. Exclusive Sword Skin - To be created, Customized Gravestone at In game MonumentThe LandsknechtsIt is said that the name of these folk travelled with them across the sea. One of the stories mentions the Servants of the Land, mighty warriors who fought with great 2 handed blades. It is said they were the original keepers of the law, this being a traditional role. We also have stories of their prowess, and a closeness with the Merchant Guilds of Old. It is thought they acted as their own independent Mercenary guilds, fighting any battle given enough glory and gold. Be it as civil law keepers or blades for hire, one shudders to think of facing such warriors.The Landsknecht Pack - Exclusive Zweihander Skin plus all cosmetics from the lower tiers. HighlanderWe know even less about the people we now call the “Highlanders”. A name which has stuck in our people's minds when so much else is forgotten. We know they split from the colony just after the Great Foundation. Given the brutality of the island, one might consider their fate grim. However stories suggest these brave few not only survived, but thrived. We know their nobles often traveled for discussion and trade with The Founder, Council and Colony. We also know that times were not always good, and more than one war was fought. Between these factors, and their ability to survive, the highlanders have forged their name in our memory. The Highlander Pack - Exclusive Claymore Skin, plus all cosmetics from the lower tiers. Followers of WodenAn elusive group of people not known by many, often seen bearing amphibious creatures on their shields and helms. It is said that on the dies mercurii their shrieks can be heard throughout the woods.Follwers of Woden Pack - Exclusive Frogmouth Helm Skin plus Frog Crest. The MerchantWe know it's due to the colony's Merchant class, that we, the people, owe our current industrial abilities.

The Nintendo Switch MagGo travel bag gives gamers an easier way to carry their console on-the-go, and spend more time playing it, too. Designed for your Nintendo Switch. Made for gamers.
 

 
Why do you need MagGo?
Technology and video games are rapidly evolving, game consoles are constantly changing, and upgrades are always occurring. Your bag should also be upgraded, too. Get the power of evolving tech, upgraded gaming, and stunning travel features in ONE bag.
Possibly the greatest thing about the Nintendo Switch is just how portable it is. We designed the invisible magnetic drop-down game station built into the MagGo™ to maximize the portability of your Nintendo Switch.
 

 
Take your gaming to-go with MagGo. You can safely bring your console with you to keep you busy wherever you go.
 

Bring your A-game everywhere with MagGo.

<h3>Welcome to Eerie Pines!</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Daimee! I’m a recent graduate of Fitchburg State University who majored in Game Design and minored in Computer Science! It’s always been a dream of mine to entertain people, and I hope to achieve that dream with Worldstrider Studios, starting with this very game!</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Allie, I do art. I also majored in game design for a while. Anyone who knows me personally has known that this game has been a long time coming because I came up with the idea years ago, and now I’m the game’s creative lead. Wowza isn’t that neato.</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Matt! I majored in Game Design in college. I’ve been writing ideas for games in the backs of my school notebooks since I was in Kindergarten, and I’m psyched to be able to finally put some of those ideas to work!</p>
<p>And together, we’re Worldstrider! We’re each passionate game designers and developers, and we want nothing more than to put our minds and skills to work making fun, interesting games for all the world to experience!</p>
<p>For this particular game, we aim to create a 6-8 hour experience for each of the five different cryptids present in the game, as well as a multitude of interesting interactions and storylines which connect the otherwise disparate stories, including a story surrounding the mysterious Agent Manatti...</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our budget can be broken down into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development Tools and Distribution</li>
<li>Voice Acting and Composition</li>
<li>Business Founding and Consultation</li>
<li>QA Testing</li>
<li>Personnel Bonuses (for ourselves, in lieu of payment during development, as well as for other contracted personnel who performed services for us prior to the project being funded)</li>
<li>Safety funds for unforeseen expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don’t reach our full goal, the first thing to go is the core dev team’s personnel bonuses, and after that it will have to start to eat into safety funds and QA. While much of our budget is ideal -- that is to say, we can theoretically produce the game without it -- there are some things, such as payment for independent contractors and costs for business founding and distribution, without which we will not be able to develop the game, so we ask you to please aim to make this game fully funded!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenges we face relate to the founding of our new business, as none of us have founded our own business before. There is much that needs to be done before our business is officially recognized, and even more to take care of after that. However, we have numerous resources at our disposal, including close friends and family with experience which we will leverage to their fullest extents.</p>
<p>As for the challenges of game development, this is actually a very low-risk project. It is a fairly simple project from a technological standpoint, with the bulk of the burden lying on writing and art, both of which can certainly be completed given enough time. Additionally, the game’s core systems have already been programmed, complete with a functional node-based dialogue editor to ensure that you’ll have the game you helped pay for as soon as humanly possible!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If this project looks fun to you but you don’t have the money to spare, don’t worry! If you can share the campaign to your social media feeds, or even just discuss the game with your friends in person, that’s an excellent way to support us as well! After all, the more people who know about the game, the more likely we are to reach our funding goals!</p>

         It’s a Solarpunk world! In this time, solar power technology has become so advanced that it is now the world's primary energy source. The architecture and people's lifestyle are well blended with natural elements, where futuristic structures blend smoothly with trees, gardens, water and the natural landscape. Cities are built with the intention to evoke a sense of natural beauty and renewal​ Radiant Bay - The Arts & Culture DistrictRadient Bay is known throughout for it's high fashion and the luxurious lifestyles of its residents. Facing the beautiful Pacific coast, this region was one of the earliest adopters and benefactors of the solar tech revolution in 2120. Durbin - The Solar ShantiesNot all cities have benefited from the solar revolution of 2120. Durbin was once a prosperous and booming town due to its seemingly limitless supply of fossil fuels. However, after 2120 humankind as a whole became immediately less dependent on these fuels, and so Durbin's fortunes dried up. A town unprepared for the revolution, its citizens now find themselves challenged by poverty and a life of difficulty. Eldinburgh - The Hidden CityA city founded by those who wish not to be found, Eldinburgh is known for its stunning architecture and seamless integration of the solarpunk motif. The city is hidden beneath a canopy of forest and trees continues to be an place of mystery for all but those who reside in it. Grand Soleil - A Modern MetropolisThe largest metropolis of the Radia, Grand Soleil is a sight to behold. With an incredible population of over 50 million, it is known throughout as the city where dreams are made...or crushed.   DeLTA is helpful, friendly, determined, rational, and very fact-based. She possesses an incredible ability to reason and problem solve. She was created by Dr. Noor Shelton to be a rational being; governed by reason, free of bias, prejudice, or emotionally-clouded judgment. Her purpose is to demonstrate to the world the promise of AI and what it can bring to humankind.It’s been one year since DeLTA was created and, despite all her promise, she has yet to gain widespread acceptance from society. Decades of overhyped tech reveals about the ""next great AI '' failing to deliver on their lofty expectations have left Radian society jaded and skeptical of DeLTA’s potential. But she is determined to prove her worth and show the world that she's more than just another droid. Humorous, light-hearted, yet comfortable with telling it how it is, Dr. Noor Shelton is an optimist. She is a world renowned roboticist, advanced AI expert, and the creator of DeLTA. She's hopeful for what the future of AI can do for humankind.Dr. Shelton created DeLTA to be a rational being -  free of bias or prejudice - that will show humanity the promise of AI. She believes that droids can be more than just tools, possessing the boundless potential to inspire and benefit humanity. Dr. Shelton's hope is that, one day, through DeLTA's example, humanity would reach its highest potential of reasoning, justice, and equality. Fierce, fast, and confident, Ann Marie Dorado (or ""AnnDROID"", as she prefers to be called) enjoys the thrill of a challenge. Oh, and she’s also deadly.Dr. Dorado scanned her own mind to create this protodroid using her “Digital Mind-Mapping” technique. A byproduct of the scan is that the scanned mind's emotional capacity is carried over. So AnnDROID can experience true human emotion -- likes, dislikes, excitement, disappointment, etc. However, much like a child to a parent, AnnDROID's mind is unique. AnnDROID was created to eliminate drone gangs swiftly. More often than not, she resorts to taking their lives to both end the threat quickly and send a message. For AnnDROID, her means are justified because “It is better to save the many at the cost of the few. It is a simple calculus.” Dr. Dorado is the world's leading roboticist and AI specialist. She is somewhat somber due to her deep concern with the well-being of humanity. She is from southern Radia (modern day Mexico) and is Dr. Shelton former graduate school research advisor.Dr. Dorado believes that our greatest human trait is our emotional capacity. As such, she specializes in recreating emotion in AI. Using her revolutionary ""Digital Mind-Mapping"" technique, she mapped her own mind to create the protodroid with emotion, Ann Marie Dorado. Due to this inheritance, Dr. Dorado considers AnnDROID to be her daughter. Dr. Dorado’s deep concern for humanity is what fuels her desire to end the drone-gang threat at all costs. So she has concluded that can only be done by taking their lives swiftly. She asks, ""how many more families must we let them tear apart before we’ve decided that enough is enough?"" Dr. V is an entrepreneur and CEO of the world's leading drone design and manufacturing company. Calculating, charismatic yet impatient with under-performance, he was a top graduate of the robotics university where he and Dr. Shelton were classmates. Over time, their shared passion for robotics brought them together. But their clashing visions for the potential of protodroids drove them apart.His belief is that all robots are simply tools. And that any endeavor to develop human-like AI is a fool’s errand. Instead, he focuses on weapons; to him, the results are measurable and instantly valuable.

It features a unique mix of third person exploration along with side scrolling combat with a heavy emphasis on timing attacks and blocking.A god in Into the Eternal is a being capable of creating worlds and setting events in motion. Once they ascend from that world they can no longer control it, and must trust that man will do right by their creation. After many worlds fell into ruin due to man's passion for war, the gods came up with a solution.They created a monster called the Great Exiler, which would rise from the ocean every 900 years - and if man didn't work together to destroy it, then the huge beast would destroy everything. Man would have to start over.As Into The Eternal begins, the Great Exiler has been spotted in the northeast, and the world is in a panic trying to figure out what to do. As legend has it, you'll need to seek out eight great temples, defeat their guardians, and secure the eight gems in order to gain access to The Eternal - an ancient palace containing a weapon that can destroy the Great Exiler.The journey will not be easy, however, as you'll not only need to find the temples, but also the key which opens them. These are typically held by ancient families seeking out a warrior that can be trusted with such a dangerous task.And while many will help you, there are others that will try to impede you. You'll be thrown into the middle of a conflict between warring kingdoms - each hoping the Great Exiler can be used to destroy their rival.You play as Arus - a monster hunter that just arrived on the shores of Southwood and find yourself immediately thrown into the middle of conflict. The game is unique in how the overworld and combat mix together. When exploring, monsters will pull you into arena battles where the view will shift from over the shoulder 3D to a classic 2.5D metroidvania style of combat.

If the player opts into an aggressive playstyle, the Vampire can build a hyper-efficient deck or bring both players' life totals down extremely quickly. Against faster classes where the Vampire's life total is precious, the player can take advantage of the class' powerful attrition tools. By filling the opponent's deck with Leeches and converting the opponent's cards into an army of Servants, the Vampire can bleed the opponent dry of resources.<br/><br/><strong>The Merchant</strong> is unique among classes. Instead of trying to acquire bigger and better weapons, the Merchant focuses on winning through his economy. The Merchant is fantastic at getting very rich, very quickly. He gathers currencies from all corners of the world, mines an endless stream of gems, and upgrades his coins and equipment along the way. He always gets the better end of a trade- but not through honest means. The Merchant can bury his opponents in an avalanche of useless counterfeit coins and tariffs. Mercenaries are the main offensive tool in his arsenal, but they don't come cheap. Once the Merchant has built his wealth, he can pay for an army to wipe out the competition, or end the game through his alternate win condition- building a massive and extravagant deck of cards.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523304730/p5orsl4dnucnzyiygzjn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The Bazaar is neither Pay to Win nor Pay to Play.

We are a married couple and have been collaborating on digital projects for almost 18 years. We’re probably best known for the videogames that we have made with <a href=""http://tale-of-tales.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Tale of Tales</strong></a>. Games like <i>The Graveyard</i>, <i>The Path</i>, <i>Bientôt l’été</i>, <i>Luxuria Superbia</i> and <i>Sunset</i>. But it all started 10 years ago with the release of our first game <a href=""http://Tale-of-Tales.com/TheEndlessForest"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The Endless Forest</i></a>.</p><p>Every indie game developer starts with the dream of making a <strong>massively multiplayer game</strong>. Only to find out that those are incredibly big and complicated and not something that a smart creator starts their career with. But <strong>we did</strong>. We just began small and expanded the game in phases.</p><p>The Endless Forest being our <strong>first release</strong>, it was created with <strong>more enthusiasm than experience</strong>. And with technology that has not aged very well. Despite of that it became <strong>very popular</strong> and remains so to this day. But several years ago we had to admit to ourselves that<strong> the technology behind the game just couldn’t handle further expansion</strong>, or even our very special <strong>live events</strong> the popularity of which simply caused every player’s computer to <strong>lag or crash</strong>.</p><p>The Endless Forest has been our <strong>creative cornerstone</strong> and we want to take it further. We don’t want to hide it anymore out of fear that the technology wouldn’t be able to handle an increased amount of players. And we want to add<strong> all the ideas that we have come up with together with the players</strong> over the years.</p><p>To be able to do that, we want to <strong>recreate the game faithfully with modern technology</strong>. That is the primary goal of this campaign: to collect the funding necessary for the <strong>time</strong>, <strong>manpower</strong> and <strong>equipment </strong>that remaking The Endless Forest requires. Once that is done, we can finally <strong>expand the game</strong> further and <strong>invite everyone</strong> to join the wonderful community that has formed around it.</p><p><strong>We are here at IndieGogo to ask you to help make that happen.</strong></p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477677006/yagv6eme4ji6fmlymkzk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h2><p>The Endless Forest in its current state has cost about <strong>100,000 Euros</strong> to develop. But since the creative design work is already done and all of the assets have already been made, we can remake the game with less than half that budget. Still 40,000 Euros because the <strong>complexity </strong>of the game and the need for <strong>optimization </strong>(the entire point of this exercise) will take a <strong>serious amount of work</strong>. Additionally, many assets will need to be found, converted, tweaked or even remade to suit the new engine.</p><p>Most of the money goes towards <strong>keeping Tale of Tales running</strong> and paying our wages. Making games is our <strong>full time occupation</strong>. And The Endless Forest is a <strong>free game</strong>. We get some income from sales of other games, patronage, donations, teaching and lectures. But that is only about a quarter of what we need to survive. For the remaining three quarters <strong>we need your help</strong>.</p><p>Reaching the 40,000 Euro goal, complemented by our own contributions, will allow us to <strong>work for 9 months</strong>, pay for <strong>extra hardware and software</strong> and hire <strong>consultants</strong> to advise on the more complicated programming issues. Since we also have other projects running, development will be spread out over the next 12 to 18 months.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>If we would <strong>not </strong>reach the goal, we will do our best with what we have, maybe start over with a modest first phase and let the current game run alongside it.

And the remake will also allow <strong>Mac </strong>and<strong> Linux</strong> users to join. So your contribution will help <strong>other people</strong> to enjoy this game as well as <strong>yourself</strong>. And any player who supports the remake will get an <strong>exclusive deer costume</strong> especially designed for the <strong>ten year anniversary</strong> of the game.

And it has influenced all the games that followed (and some by other developers, most notably <a href=""http://thatgamecompany.com/games/journey/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Journey </i></a>by our sister studio Thatgamecompany). Originally, in response to a commission for the Luxembourg Museum of Modern Art in 2003, we had designed <strong>a full-featured if somewhat surreal multiplayer online game</strong>. But when, after releasing a first phase of the game with a much smaller environment and far fewer features, we noticed how many players were <strong>extremely creative</strong> with inventing ways of playing in this very minimal game, we abandoned most of our ideas in favor of <strong>developing the game further in collaboration with the players</strong>. Not only did their activity in the Forest inspire all sorts of ideas but many players also actively designed things, some of which are currently implemented and enjoyed by all. We intend to continue that creative method.</p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477677113/txbhzsiq25jw4zyhryei.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><p>While The Endless Forest offers a <strong>very relaxing and whimsical experience</strong> -we can’t help but feel happy and laugh hard when we’re playing- its design was, and still is, nothing short of <strong>radical</strong>. There is <strong>no formal gameplay</strong> in The Endless Forest: <strong>no quests</strong>, <strong>no tasks</strong>, <strong>no puzzles</strong>. There is <strong>no story</strong> in the game either -although there are many things in the forest that inspire imagining tales (shared by the players on the game’s very active <a href=""http://endlessforest.org/community"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">community website</a>). Apart from the configuration menus, there is also <strong>no language</strong>. We wanted to avoid text-based communication in order to prevent the verbal abuse that is all too common in online games. The deer avatars don’t even have names. Instead players, if they choose to register (which is not necessary to play!), select a unique <strong>pictogram </strong>to identify their avatar. Because of the game’s success, there have already been four generations of these pictograms, which adds to the history of the Forest. Even <strong>character customization</strong>, a staple of online games, has been designed as a <strong>playful social feature</strong>. In The Endless Forest you can only change the appearance of other players, by casting magic that can be acquired by having your deer avatar brush against trees, eat mushrooms, keep a sleeping deer company or sleep in a mushroom circle. The latter is a remainder of the game’s origins as a <strong>screensaver</strong>: when your computer would go to sleep, it would log into the Forest and appear as a sleeping deer.</p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477677132/rfexfcu8hwt560qlilnq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h2><p>The design of The Endless Forest is a prime example of<strong> favoring playing over gaming</strong>. This is a new form of entertainment made possible by the networked computer. It allows <strong>people from different parts of the world, different ages, different cultural backgrounds, genders and social groups</strong> to interact with each other in a completely egalitarian manner. In a sense, The Endless Forest is a <strong>realized utopia</strong>, or at least the fantasy of one (which we think is very important for the human imagination). There is <strong>no war</strong> in The Endless Forest, <strong>no violence</strong>, <strong>no famine</strong>, <strong>no stress</strong>. Only <strong>beauty and joy</strong>. Every action, even if they would be intended as malicious (which is kind of silly in the context) can always be interpreted as <strong>friendly and playful</strong>. The deer in The Endless Forest are simply incapable of causing harm. The emotional effect of this is tremendous and stimulates all sorts of <strong>fun social activities</strong> among players.</p><p>Next to the fun that players invent for themselves we, the creators, Auriea and Michaël, with our ancient deer avatars, have reserved<strong> special powers</strong> for ourselves in the Forest. When the mood strikes, we open up our <strong>magical toolbox</strong> and make it rain, make giant flowers explode, change everyone into frogs, make statues float and so on. We call this <a href=""http://tale-of-tales.com/TheEndlessForest/abiogenesis.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Abiogenesis</strong> </a>(=life emerging from inorganic matter). We often do this spontaneously but also organize <strong>festivals </strong>to celebrate certain events throughout the year. There is <strong>no simulation of day and night cycle, weather or seasons</strong> in The Endless Forest. When it snows in the night you know that we have visited the Forest and made it so. This is not just an ironic reference to the divine powers of software creators but also, and more importantly, creates an <strong>active bond between the players and the makers</strong>. The Endless Forest is not just a consumer product for your entertainment. It is <strong>a living work of art</strong>, a sort of ongoing digital theater, that every player plays an active role in.</p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477677542/vmm7wfpaiag6zpxjswrv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477677206/hwirdje2k2retxz10c6x.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h2><p>We feel that this sort of game is so<strong> rare and important</strong> that we cannot bring ourselves to abandon it to inevitable changes in technology. We believe that<strong> it should exist</strong>. Not just for the players who get great joy out of it.

We need to continue this project! <i>It’s important.</i></p><p>The Endless Forest was the first game we released. It was created in an engine called <i>Quest3D</i>. We have also created our most famous game, <a href=""http://thepath-game.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The Path</i></a>, in this engine. A recent update of the <i>Windows 10</i> operating system, however has considerably damaged the performance of The Path. And we worry that the same might happen to The Endless Forest.

She was in New York, he was in Belgium. Immediately there was a connection and less than half a year later they lived together in Belgium. But it wasn’t just love and kisses! We were serious about our collaboration, even exclusive! At first we made websites together.

In the beginning of the millennium the web changed drastically and we switched to making <strong>videogames </strong>instead. But our <strong>love for the internet</strong> was clearly still present when we made The Endless Forest. As <strong>outsiders </strong>to games our approach caused <strong>a few frowns</strong> here and there along the way. But we fought hard for recognition and title after title we showed the game community another facet of the endless amount of things you can do in this medium. We even founded a platform to support development of videogames outside of the usual formal conventions, called <strong>notgames</strong>. Then last year, after a final attempt to fit in we sort of called it quits, only to go back to our roots: <strong>free, playful-yet-sincere interactive experiences that inspire joy and awe</strong>, like The Endless Forest.</p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477677438/zgwf6v0l5knbzdymfotm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><p><strong>Lina Kusaite</strong> is an Lithuanian artist who lives in Brussels.

She made hundreds of wonderful drawings for us. We were so enchanted with her work that we promptly engaged her again for The Endless Forest. The earliest prototypes of the game contained regular deer. But when Lina came along, <strong>she kept drawing deer with human faces</strong>. We were surprised. That wasn’t our intention! We just wanted to make a deer game. But in the end we realized that she was right. Not only were her designs gorgeous, they also worked really well with all the magical things we wanted to happen in the forest. Somehow the human faces on the deer made everything plausible. Next to the design of the deer characters and many pelts and antlers, she also drew even more fantastical creatures like centaurs and tree deer. And these are a big part of the reason why we want to rebuild the engine so we can expand it. <strong>We want to meet her creations</strong>, see them live in the forest, invent stories about the impossible love between the <i>Sun Deer</i> and the <i>Tree Deer</i>, hear the sad song of the <i>Sadawaar</i>, hide from her <i>Baba Yaga</i> and so on.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/189353795?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div>

Our collaboration started with the <strong>background tune</strong> for the configuration menu in The Endless Forest. Otherwise there was no music in the game back then. But when <strong>Abiogenesis </strong>was being made, we invited him to compose for the Twin Gods, including a cover of <strong>Do Re Mi</strong> from <i>The Sound of Music</i> (just because of the line <i>“Do a deer, a female deer”</i> -which is extra funny because all the deer in The Endless Forest are stags). And of course he also wrote the song that the deer <strong>dance </strong>to and that gets fuller and louder as more dancers join in. For <strong>Halloween</strong>, we simply reversed it to sound creepy. After The Endless Forest Gerry wrote, composed and played the <strong>song about death</strong> in The Graveyard and the music for <strong>Salome’s dance</strong> in Fatale. And when the time comes to add more music to The Endless Forest, his contributions will no doubt greatly enrich the experience. I bet we can ask him to use antlers as an instrument!</p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477677491/w2icovlic8jjgzurg3pk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h2><p>While we have <strong>a lot of experience</strong> creating software as artists with no formal programming education whatsoever, using a<strong> </strong><strong>new engine</strong> like Unreal comes with a certain amount of risk. So far we have only created one prototype in the engine and we’re still unfamiliar with aspects of the editor that we will need for The Endless Forest (most notably <strong>networking </strong>and <strong>character animation</strong>). But a brief glance at the <strong>tools </strong>provided by Unreal fills us with sufficient confidence to tackle this considerable task. Nevertheless we intend to seek advice from<strong> seasoned professionals</strong> and are reserving part of the budget for precisely this purpose. In fact, when creating The Endless Forest the first time around, we worked with a programmer to flesh out the software structure as well as the base logic for networking. The cool thing about Unreal (as opposed to Quest3D) is that <strong>part of the problems have already been solved</strong> by the creators of the engine. So yeah, we can do this.</p><p>Another hurdle may be <strong>software formats</strong>. The Quest3D engine was very picky about formats for models and textures, and we may not be able to import them directly in Unreal. We will have to find the <strong>source files</strong> of these assets on old file servers and archive CD-Roms and then try to open them in contemporary versions of <i>Blender </i>and <i>Max </i>(or dig up old versions of these programs and hope they can export to a format that Unreal can read). One obvious risk is that some source files might be <strong>lost </strong>(either misplaced or on corrupted disks). Another is that the data may have become <strong>unreadable </strong>or otherwise <strong>unusable</strong>. In all those cases we will simply <strong>remake </strong>the models and textures faithfully.</p><p>And finally, we have <strong>other projects</strong> running simultaneously that we don’t want to neglect. Cathedral-in-the-Clouds is huge and there may also be commissions for art projects that we won’t want to refuse. This will impact the time it will take to finish the remaking of The Endless Forest. But simultaneously it will also put us in <strong>a more secure position</strong>, which may be useful in case we underestimated the time to re-create The Endless Forest. Another positive is that there’s a lot of (spiritual, technical and logistical) <strong>similarities </strong>between The Endless Forest and Cathedral-in-the-Clouds. They are both <strong>non-commercial</strong> projects with an <strong>uplifting </strong>purpose, they are both <strong>multiplayer</strong>, and both thrive on <strong>commissions </strong>and <strong>expansions</strong>. After all, The Endless Forest started on the ruin of a cathedral and was inspired by the legend of Saint Hubert! We don’t exclude some form of overlap between the two programs in the future.</p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477677516/aioudu9rknrvywnfgax8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h2><p>The best thing you can do now is click the “<strong>BACK IT</strong>” button at the top of this page and invest some money in the future of one the most <strong>innovative</strong>, <strong>entertaining</strong>, <strong>artistic </strong>and <strong>free </strong>games ever.

The First Forest is only a quarter of the current forest in size. It’s the patch with poppies, hyacinths and ferns around The Ruin of the old cathedral. The deer avatars are identified by pictograms only. We will create a fifth generation of pictograms for new players. In this first phase, the deer can only engage in a minimal set of activities (sniffing, rubbing, jumping) and they all look the same (there’s no Forest Magic in Phase One). But the new engine will enable Mac OS X and Linux users to play next to those on Windows.</p><h3>34,000: Phase Two</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480371286/xugl1kmsvdtse7jsqanm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In Phase Two, the terrain doubles in size to include the area around The Pond, with the Twin Gods hill, the Crying Idol and The Little Bridge. The Old Oak will also be added in this phase. Forest Magic will allow the deer to change each other’s appearance. And there will be a bunch more activities and expressive actions for the deer to perform (dancing, laughing, and so on). The Abiogenesis system will give us the power to change the weather and organize spectacular live festivals.</p><p>At this point we should be able to implement at least some of the in-game perks such as the Tin Deer, the Valentine set, the divine sets, and so on.</p><h3>40,000: Phase Three</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480371303/qijh5pgwk8n2wdfqfjfs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In Phase Three, the current phase, the Birch Forest is added with sycamores, blue berries and fluttering birds. This area features The Playground and De Drinkplaats. As of Phase Three new players start their adventures as a Fawn, to grow into an adult deer after a month. Many more deer costumes will be added to celebrate Carnival and Mardi Gras. And our favorite Big Zombie Deer will appear again around Halloween.</p><p>To improve efficiency and performance of the technology, we will also consult with experts before we release the full remake of The Endless Forest.</p><h3>46,000: Phase Four</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480371335/zhx2m498uhigzwubno9p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Exceeding the target would allow us add a new area with grasslands and a cliff. The long desired grazing action will be added so the deer can munch on the new weeds to their hearts’ content. On top of the cliff, the mysterious Sun Deer will find a home, overlooking the grassy valley. We will add more expressive actions. And fawns will get to keep Forest Magic when they are old enough to do so.</p><h3>52,000: Phase Five</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480371318/hn2r5gn5oghz3gsuws9f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In Phase five a new visitor will appear in the grasslands. The Sadawaar (or Shadhavar) is a mythical animal with a horn through which the wind plays heavenly music. The deer will be able to entrust this noble creature with their favorite costume so they can frolic and experiment without worrying about losing their unique looks forever. Next to the Sadawaar, two giant turtles will make their appearance that offer rides to the deer across the forest along the cardinal directions. In this phase we will also add a number of new deer sets selected from designs created by the community.</p><h3>58,000: extra features</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480371357/weohjcdrqhye2wip19p4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>And then there’s a bunch of things we want to do that are not part of the game itself.

There’s a few tweaks we definitely want to make to the community site but we really should do a major overhaul. While The Endless Forest may never run on mobile devices, we do dream of a companion app that creates some connection to the game (like a way to see your deer or look into the forest through a 3D version of the realtime map). Similarly we would like to be able to conjure up some Abiogenesis effects even when we are not at our desks, perhaps via a mobile app, or a private web page. And finally we think it would be great fun if The Endless Forest could be observed in Virtual Reality, not by deer, but rather by owls sitting in trees.</p><p><i>What can you do to help?

We are a married couple and have been collaborating on digital projects for almost 18 years. We’re probably best known for the videogames that we have made with Tale of Tales. Games like The Graveyard, The Path, Bientôt l’été, Luxuria Superbia and Sunset. But it all started 10 years ago with the release of our first game The Endless Forest.Every indie game developer starts with the dream of making a massively multiplayer game. Only to find out that those are incredibly big and complicated and not something that a smart creator starts their career with. But we did. We just began small and expanded the game in phases.The Endless Forest being our first release, it was created with more enthusiasm than experience. And with technology that has not aged very well. Despite of that it became very popular and remains so to this day. But several years ago we had to admit to ourselves that the technology behind the game just couldn’t handle further expansion, or even our very special live events the popularity of which simply caused every player’s computer to lag or crash.The Endless Forest has been our creative cornerstone and we want to take it further. We don’t want to hide it anymore out of fear that the technology wouldn’t be able to handle an increased amount of players. And we want to add all the ideas that we have come up with together with the players over the years.To be able to do that, we want to recreate the game faithfully with modern technology. That is the primary goal of this campaign: to collect the funding necessary for the time, manpower and equipment that remaking The Endless Forest requires. Once that is done, we can finally expand the game further and invite everyone to join the wonderful community that has formed around it.We are here at IndieGogo to ask you to help make that happen.The Endless Forest in its current state has cost about 100,000 Euros to develop. But since the creative design work is already done and all of the assets have already been made, we can remake the game with less than half that budget. Still 40,000 Euros because the complexity of the game and the need for optimization (the entire point of this exercise) will take a serious amount of work. Additionally, many assets will need to be found, converted, tweaked or even remade to suit the new engine.Most of the money goes towards keeping Tale of Tales running and paying our wages. Making games is our full time occupation. And The Endless Forest is a free game. We get some income from sales of other games, patronage, donations, teaching and lectures. But that is only about a quarter of what we need to survive. For the remaining three quarters we need your help.Reaching the 40,000 Euro goal, complemented by our own contributions, will allow us to work for 9 months, pay for extra hardware and software and hire consultants to advise on the more complicated programming issues. Since we also have other projects running, development will be spread out over the next 12 to 18 months.If we would not reach the goal, we will do our best with what we have, maybe start over with a modest first phase and let the current game run alongside it. And if we are really far under, we will add some new content that the current engine can still handle and the rest goes towards keeping the server up and running.Remaking The Endless Forest will potentially create access to other types of funding. The local art grants organization that has funded a big chunk of the game as it is, the Flanders Audiovisual Fund, cannot support a remake but they have expressed interest in an expansion of the game, which is only possible with a new engine. So supporting this campaign is an investment in the future of the project.The Endless Forest will remain free after the remake. And the remake will also allow Mac and Linux users to join. So your contribution will help other people to enjoy this game as well as yourself. And any player who supports the remake will get an exclusive deer costume especially designed for the ten year anniversary of the game. So the other deer will know who they have to thank for their fun times in the forest.The Endless Forest was the first game that we released with Tale of Tales (in 2005). And it has influenced all the games that followed (and some by other developers, most notably Journey by our sister studio Thatgamecompany). Originally, in response to a commission for the Luxembourg Museum of Modern Art in 2003, we had designed a full-featured if somewhat surreal multiplayer online game. But when, after releasing a first phase of the game with a much smaller environment and far fewer features, we noticed how many players were extremely creative with inventing ways of playing in this very minimal game, we abandoned most of our ideas in favor of developing the game further in collaboration with the players. Not only did their activity in the Forest inspire all sorts of ideas but many players also actively designed things, some of which are currently implemented and enjoyed by all. We intend to continue that creative method.While The Endless Forest offers a very relaxing and whimsical experience -we can’t help but feel happy and laugh hard when we’re playing- its design was, and still is, nothing short of radical. There is no formal gameplay in The Endless Forest: no quests, no tasks, no puzzles. There is no story in the game either -although there are many things in the forest that inspire imagining tales (shared by the players on the game’s very active community website). Apart from the configuration menus, there is also no language. We wanted to avoid text-based communication in order to prevent the verbal abuse that is all too common in online games. The deer avatars don’t even have names. Instead players, if they choose to register (which is not necessary to play!), select a unique pictogram to identify their avatar. Because of the game’s success, there have already been four generations of these pictograms, which adds to the history of the Forest. Even character customization, a staple of online games, has been designed as a playful social feature. In The Endless Forest you can only change the appearance of other players, by casting magic that can be acquired by having your deer avatar brush against trees, eat mushrooms, keep a sleeping deer company or sleep in a mushroom circle. The latter is a remainder of the game’s origins as a screensaver: when your computer would go to sleep, it would log into the Forest and appear as a sleeping deer.The design of The Endless Forest is a prime example of favoring playing over gaming. This is a new form of entertainment made possible by the networked computer. It allows people from different parts of the world, different ages, different cultural backgrounds, genders and social groups to interact with each other in a completely egalitarian manner. In a sense, The Endless Forest is a realized utopia, or at least the fantasy of one (which we think is very important for the human imagination). There is no war in The Endless Forest, no violence, no famine, no stress. Only beauty and joy. Every action, even if they would be intended as malicious (which is kind of silly in the context) can always be interpreted as friendly and playful. The deer in The Endless Forest are simply incapable of causing harm. The emotional effect of this is tremendous and stimulates all sorts of fun social activities among players.Next to the fun that players invent for themselves we, the creators, Auriea and Michaël, with our ancient deer avatars, have reserved special powers for ourselves in the Forest. When the mood strikes, we open up our magical toolbox and make it rain, make giant flowers explode, change everyone into frogs, make statues float and so on. We call this Abiogenesis (=life emerging from inorganic matter). We often do this spontaneously but also organize festivals to celebrate certain events throughout the year. There is no simulation of day and night cycle, weather or seasons in The Endless Forest. When it snows in the night you know that we have visited the Forest and made it so. This is not just an ironic reference to the divine powers of software creators but also, and more importantly, creates an active bond between the players and the makers. The Endless Forest is not just a consumer product for your entertainment. It is a living work of art, a sort of ongoing digital theater, that every player plays an active role in.We feel that this sort of game is so rare and important that we cannot bring ourselves to abandon it to inevitable changes in technology. We believe that it should exist. Not just for the players who get great joy out of it. But also for the game design community as a demonstration of how totally free creative projects have a place in an industry and society that is all too often governed by financial need or pure cynicism. An offer of beauty and joy, with no strings attached. That is what this campaign is about. That is what you will be supporting. We need to continue this project! It’s important.The Endless Forest was the first game we released. It was created in an engine called Quest3D. We have also created our most famous game, The Path, in this engine. A recent update of the Windows 10 operating system, however has considerably damaged the performance of The Path. And we worry that the same might happen to The Endless Forest. This adds some urgency to this campaign.With The Graveyard we shifted to the Unity engine for creating games. As a script-based engine (Quest3D was a visual programming tool), it limited what we could do creatively as designers. But that did not stop us from learning and evolving. After The Graveyard, we made Fatale in Unity, and also Vanitas, our first iPhone game. Then we made the literature-inspired Bientôt l’été and IGF Nuovo award winner Luxuria Superbia. Last year we released our last game, Sunset, also made in Unity. That’s over a decade of artistic and technical growth since the release of The Endless Forest. We intend to pour all of that experience and know-how into the remake of the game. It will be so good!For the remake we will use the Unreal engine that we have switched to recently (for Cathedral-in-the-Clouds). We find Unreal a much more solid choice than Unity, it is free for non-commercial projects and above all, it has a superbly designed visual programming editor, that will allow us to get back to our creative programming roots.  The Endless Forest would be nothing without its community of enthusiastic players who for some strange reason find great joy in prancing around as a deer through glorious infinite woods. The nature of the game inspires not only all sorts of good feelings but also astounding artistic creativity. Please allow us to share some of their tremendous output below. And trust us when we say that this is but a tiny tip of the magnificent iceberg.Auriea and Michaël have been collaborating since they met on the internet of 1999. She was in New York, he was in Belgium. Immediately there was a connection and less than half a year later they lived together in Belgium. But it wasn’t just love and kisses! We were serious about our collaboration, even exclusive! At first we made websites together. One of them won a prestigious prize from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In the beginning of the millennium the web changed drastically and we switched to making videogames instead. But our love for the internet was clearly still present when we made The Endless Forest. As outsiders to games our approach caused a few frowns here and there along the way. But we fought hard for recognition and title after title we showed the game community another facet of the endless amount of things you can do in this medium. We even founded a platform to support development of videogames outside of the usual formal conventions, called notgames. Then last year, after a final attempt to fit in we sort of called it quits, only to go back to our roots: free, playful-yet-sincere interactive experiences that inspire joy and awe, like The Endless Forest.Lina Kusaite is an Lithuanian artist who lives in Brussels. When presenting 8, our never finished first game idea, at an event, she came up to us and offered to help. She made hundreds of wonderful drawings for us. We were so enchanted with her work that we promptly engaged her again for The Endless Forest. The earliest prototypes of the game contained regular deer. But when Lina came along, she kept drawing deer with human faces. We were surprised. That wasn’t our intention! We just wanted to make a deer game. But in the end we realized that she was right. Not only were her designs gorgeous, they also worked really well with all the magical things we wanted to happen in the forest. Somehow the human faces on the deer made everything plausible. Next to the design of the deer characters and many pelts and antlers, she also drew even more fantastical creatures like centaurs and tree deer. And these are a big part of the reason why we want to rebuild the engine so we can expand it. We want to meet her creations, see them live in the forest, invent stories about the impossible love between the Sun Deer and the Tree Deer, hear the sad song of the Sadawaar, hide from her Baba Yaga and so on. 

We talked to Lina over Skype to find out why the deer have faces and resolve many other mysteries.
 Another collaborator we discovered when working on 8 is Laura Raines Smith. And it’s also like a love story because we never parted ways. Laura is the unofficial third member of Tale of Tales. She has animated all of our characters! Yes, all of them: the deaf mute girl in 8, the deer in The Endless Forest, of course, the old woman in The Graveyard, the Red Girls in The Path, and their wolves, Salome in Fatale (including a flabbergasting piece of rotoscoping for the Dance of the Seven Veils), homme and femme in Bientôt l’été and of course Angela Burnes in Sunset. Laura is an animating machine! And her style has brought so much flair to our work! Tale of Tales’ games would have been very different indeed without her wonderful work! And we know we can count on her for the new animations that we want to add to The Endless Forest. They will be amazing! Gerry De Mol is also a Tale of Tales old-timer. The first music he made for us was for The Endless Forest. Gerry is a multi-instrumentalist specialized in guitar and all sorts of exotic string instruments. He is also a wonderful songwriter (but sadly only Dutch-speakers can truly appreciate his poetic talent)! Our collaboration started with the background tune for the configuration menu in The Endless Forest. Otherwise there was no music in the game back then. But when Abiogenesis was being made, we invited him to compose for the Twin Gods, including a cover of Do Re Mi from The Sound of Music (just because of the line “Do a deer, a female deer” -which is extra funny because all the deer in The Endless Forest are stags). And of course he also wrote the song that the deer dance to and that gets fuller and louder as more dancers join in. For Halloween, we simply reversed it to sound creepy. After The Endless Forest Gerry wrote, composed and played the song about death in The Graveyard and the music for Salome’s dance in Fatale. And when the time comes to add more music to The Endless Forest, his contributions will no doubt greatly enrich the experience. I bet we can ask him to use antlers as an instrument!While we have a lot of experience creating software as artists with no formal programming education whatsoever, using a new engine like Unreal comes with a certain amount of risk. So far we have only created one prototype in the engine and we’re still unfamiliar with aspects of the editor that we will need for The Endless Forest (most notably networking and character animation). But a brief glance at the tools provided by Unreal fills us with sufficient confidence to tackle this considerable task. Nevertheless we intend to seek advice from seasoned professionals and are reserving part of the budget for precisely this purpose. In fact, when creating The Endless Forest the first time around, we worked with a programmer to flesh out the software structure as well as the base logic for networking. The cool thing about Unreal (as opposed to Quest3D) is that part of the problems have already been solved by the creators of the engine. So yeah, we can do this.Another hurdle may be software formats. The Quest3D engine was very picky about formats for models and textures, and we may not be able to import them directly in Unreal. We will have to find the source files of these assets on old file servers and archive CD-Roms and then try to open them in contemporary versions of Blender and Max (or dig up old versions of these programs and hope they can export to a format that Unreal can read). One obvious risk is that some source files might be lost (either misplaced or on corrupted disks). Another is that the data may have become unreadable or otherwise unusable. In all those cases we will simply remake the models and textures faithfully.And finally, we have other projects running simultaneously that we don’t want to neglect. Cathedral-in-the-Clouds is huge and there may also be commissions for art projects that we won’t want to refuse. This will impact the time it will take to finish the remaking of The Endless Forest. But simultaneously it will also put us in a more secure position, which may be useful in case we underestimated the time to re-create The Endless Forest. Another positive is that there’s a lot of (spiritual, technical and logistical) similarities between The Endless Forest and Cathedral-in-the-Clouds. They are both non-commercial projects with an uplifting purpose, they are both multiplayer, and both thrive on commissions and expansions. After all, The Endless Forest started on the ruin of a cathedral and was inspired by the legend of Saint Hubert! We don’t exclude some form of overlap between the two programs in the future.The best thing you can do now is click the “BACK IT” button at the top of this page and invest some money in the future of one the most innovative, entertaining, artistic and free games ever. For your own joy in life and that of others. And for showing the world that unbridled creativity is a good thing!But if you don’t have any money or you don’t like spending it or there’s some other reason that prevents you from doing the obvious, you can still help the rest of us by sharing the idea with your friends and family. Who knows? Maybe one of them can help. And if they do, they also help you because in the end everyone gets the game for free. So be selfish! There’s buttons for sharing the campaign on Facebook and Twitter and so on right next to that “BACK IT” button.EXTENDEDWe have extended the fundraising campaign of the second decade of The Endless Forest until 27 December. Hopefully the Christmas spirit will stimulate gift giving, either to the community in the form of contributions, or to yourself or your friends in the form of perks.The generous contributions so far have instilled enough confidence in us to start the work on this project. But we still need to reach our target to be able to deliver a full remake of the game. And if we would exceed the target we could even start expanding the Forest.Here’s the steps we are collecting towards:28,000: Phase OneWith 28,000 Euros we will be able to remake the first phase of The Endless Forest as it was originally released more than ten years ago but with glorious new technology underneath. The First Forest is only a quarter of the current forest in size. It’s the patch with poppies, hyacinths and ferns around The Ruin of the old cathedral. The deer avatars are identified by pictograms only. We will create a fifth generation of pictograms for new players. In this first phase, the deer can only engage in a minimal set of activities (sniffing, rubbing, jumping) and they all look the same (there’s no Forest Magic in Phase One). But the new engine will enable Mac OS X and Linux users to play next to those on Windows.34,000: Phase TwoIn Phase Two, the terrain doubles in size to include the area around The Pond, with the Twin Gods hill, the Crying Idol and The Little Bridge. The Old Oak will also be added in this phase. Forest Magic will allow the deer to change each other’s appearance. And there will be a bunch more activities and expressive actions for the deer to perform (dancing, laughing, and so on). The Abiogenesis system will give us the power to change the weather and organize spectacular live festivals.At this point we should be able to implement at least some of the in-game perks such as the Tin Deer, the Valentine set, the divine sets, and so on.40,000: Phase ThreeIn Phase Three, the current phase, the Birch Forest is added with sycamores, blue berries and fluttering birds. This area features The Playground and De Drinkplaats. As of Phase Three new players start their adventures as a Fawn, to grow into an adult deer after a month. Many more deer costumes will be added to celebrate Carnival and Mardi Gras. And our favorite Big Zombie Deer will appear again around Halloween.To improve efficiency and performance of the technology, we will also consult with experts before we release the full remake of The Endless Forest.46,000: Phase FourExceeding the target would allow us add a new area with grasslands and a cliff. The long desired grazing action will be added so the deer can munch on the new weeds to their hearts’ content. On top of the cliff, the mysterious Sun Deer will find a home, overlooking the grassy valley. We will add more expressive actions. And fawns will get to keep Forest Magic when they are old enough to do so.52,000: Phase FiveIn Phase five a new visitor will appear in the grasslands. The Sadawaar (or Shadhavar) is a mythical animal with a horn through which the wind plays heavenly music. The deer will be able to entrust this noble creature with their favorite costume so they can frolic and experiment without worrying about losing their unique looks forever. Next to the Sadawaar, two giant turtles will make their appearance that offer rides to the deer across the forest along the cardinal directions. In this phase we will also add a number of new deer sets selected from designs created by the community.58,000: extra featuresAnd then there’s a bunch of things we want to do that are not part of the game itself. Hopefully we will be able to take care of some of these even if we don’t reach this target. There’s a few tweaks we definitely want to make to the community site but we really should do a major overhaul. While The Endless Forest may never run on mobile devices, we do dream of a companion app that creates some connection to the game (like a way to see your deer or look into the forest through a 3D version of the realtime map). Similarly we would like to be able to conjure up some Abiogenesis effects even when we are not at our desks, perhaps via a mobile app, or a private web page. And finally we think it would be great fun if The Endless Forest could be observed in Virtual Reality, not by deer, but rather by owls sitting in trees.What can you do to help? If you love the Forest, contribute! If you’ve already contributed, tell your friends! Post about the campaign on social media and share your enthusiasm for what we are trying to do with this game. After all, a forest is nothing without the living beings who inhabit it! We are eager to open up The Endless Forest to more players! And with your help we will make it! UPDATESWe have added an extra reward to the Forest Believer perk. Everyone who contributes 300 Euros or more will get access in the game to the beautiful Golden Pelt that so far has only been worn by the divine deer orchestrating the Abiogenesis festivals.On top of this, the Forest Believer perk also gives you access to a secret perk. Please contact us if you are a Believer (i.e. if the sum of your contributions equals or exceeds 300). Pick the Forest Fan perk to 3d print a Deer figurine! The prints will cost around €18, printed on demand via Shapeways. You get a choice from many colors and your figureen can be either unnamed or customized with your in-game Pictogram and name!  OR go for the Forest Collector perk and get access to print the Sun Deer as well! The print of this exclusive deer will cost under €50, via Shapeways. This costume was created a long time ago for the occasion of Valentine's Day. It allowed the two of us to meet in the forest as loving deer. Now we are sharing the love with everyone supporting the Second Decade for 100 € or more.Pick the Forest Lover Perk if you want your deer to look like this!Work-in-progress images of the Tin Deer set that comes with That Anniversary Look.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552166147/frczqccghyqskovk3js9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Imperium Omni is not just another “same old RPG” game like so many others. Imperium Omni has four distinct elements that make it very different from all the other role playing games you’ve played.  We reached our initial target goal, and now we are marching toward our next goal of $50,000.  Join us on this journey to help us bring this game to life!</p>
<p>The game’s actual long term goal is to move all the way from the lowliest ranked player to eventually be crowned Emperor or Empress of the world, taking that honored spot from the current holder. Now, that goal takes place over 4 full length games and probably 30 years of game time.</p>
<p>Second, the game is not only in four full parts, but each edition is serialized, allowing game content to be constantly flowing, releasing new material on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Third, what allows us to bring this game’s budget down so low is that we are using a primarily Map-Based user interface rather than a full time 3D environment. This beautiful retro-gaming approach allows us to keep our costs way down, while allowing us all to remember that maps are magic. They’ve become so mundane and commonplace now that people forget how they illuminate the world. They not only take us from one place to another, but they show us what’s possible, and what we can imagine. And while much of the game relies on maps, there’s plenty of standard animated interactions, as well as plenty of full 3D segments as well.</p>
<p>Lastly, Imperium Omni allows the player to evolve with the content, giving players the chance to not only play their primary class, but also to play concurrent classes like Pirate, Monk, Samurai or Spy. And while doing this, the player can create living relationships with any non-player character in the game, making friends, enemies and even lovers of anyone you meet.</p>
<p>This is a story that begins 30 years in the past that takes a fresh Explorer just out of the Academy and brings them into the wide world with all kinds of new twists on the concept of RPGs, including becoming the ruler of the world. The full-length Novelized Walkthrough of the first game, the Captain’s Edition, is written entirely as a story to be enjoyed everyone , non-gamers and gamers alike and it is available right now.</p>
<p>The full novel digital download is available immediately - no need to wait for the project’s completion!  With any pledge (instructions for download can be found at the bottom of this project)!  Within the scope of the novel, gamers will see all kinds of aspects of unique game-play elements seamlessly built right into the story. So the novelized walkthrough is both the story IN the game while also being the story OF the game. This game has taken a lifetime to design, and its development journey has had a lot of twists and turns.</p>

<p>“Her Imperial Majesty the Empress Illissa of the Sashire Empire, was even more stunning in person, as if the sculptors of her statues couldn’t come close to capturing her profound aura in any kind of stone or steel. Clad in armor of a golden hue, her eyes were impossible to look away from; so light-brown that they seemed to shine brighter than gold in the light. The armor she wore was decorative, rather than combat-ready, revealing a subtle décolletage not suitable for battle. A crown of gold with blood-red rubies surrounded by white diamonds rested atop her head. And framed by her long, graceful yellow-blond hair, her face was so perfectly young, and yet at the same time, it was clearly ageless and timeless. She emanated power and authority, a presence of command that was palpable, literally tangible in the room.”-- From Imperium Omni: Captain’s Edition, the novel.</p>
<p>The Empress Illissa was not born for her role, she made it. A woman who is not only the most politically powerful person in the game, but the most physically powerful one as well. She is tactically brilliant, thinking tens or hundreds of steps ahead of others. Her rule is even-handed but unrepentant and absolute. And she will never yield power without a fight, and she is absolutely certain she will always win. Because no one has ever beaten her. In terms of the story, much of the Player’s life will actually be spent in service to The Empress. She is not the enemy, she is simply a profound force to be reckoned with. And during the game the player will make many and varied allies or enemies in the long quest for the throne; a Half-Orc male Chancellor, a Human female Supreme Chancellor, a pure Elven female Countess, a Human male Grandmaster of All Monks. Every type and kind of being can be a critical piece in the arduous path to the top.</p>

<p>Content is King in the world of Role Playing, and Imperium Omni delivers multiple systems to provide that content in diverse and often unique ways. Players will find plenty of the familiar in Imperium Omni to ground them in all that they know of classic, large-scale RPGs such as deep storylines, fantasy classes, crafting and combat. But amidst that landscape of the familiar they will find not just a whole new world to explore, but new ways to explore it. In one of the game’s most exciting innovations, players will use the StoryTellers' proprietary Concurrent Class System™ to not only play their primary class, but also simultaneously play secondary alternative classes or professions such as Pirate or Monk or Samurai or Spy. Since players can explore multiple classes, this gives room to a vast array of stories-within-stories to tell, like tales of The Knights of The Concordance in The Round or The Towers of The Pharaoh or of Dead Man’s Cove and the Pirate Isles.</p>
<p>There are also player-created Missions and Stories, allowing real in-game players to craft missions that other players can do. And then there are the many Mysteries that the game has yet to reveal, such as;</p>
<p>“Imperium Omni” is the Empress’ motto, and yet it is in a language “that has been dead for hundreds of thousands of years”? What is Technomancy ... objects from before the “Re-Creation” that seem to exist outside-of-time without ever decaying? How does an entire Dwarven Kingdom get sealed off forever? Who is the Eastern King who has done what no one in history has done by uniting what cannot be ruled? And where does he come from, and does he serve the nearly omnipotent enemy Raunos? Tales within tales. And while these things allow an almost infinite permutations on Content, yet another novel feature of the game provides an entirely different way to expand the player’s experience by affecting their Primary Rank (not their Primary Class Level), where Captain is the goal in the first edition of the game. Virtually every action in the game affects the Primary Rank, every purchase, every item used, every interaction with an NPC, every mission. Everything. Other innovations include player-to-non-player relationships on a whole new level, where romances, friendships and enemies can be made, built and broken with any NPC in the game. And these relationships, both good and bad, persist and evolve from one edition of the game to the next. We are excited at this chance to create something new, yet reminiscent of those great games and we want you to be a part of it as well.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Stretch Goals  - We reached our first target, now we need to hit the next goal of $50,000:  </strong>At $50,000 we expand the content, both standard and 3D, for the Pendellhaven Prelude. We add additional locations, items, map expansions and 3D interactions.  Once we hit $50,000, our second goal is $75,000 to expand the next sections of the serialization, one by one bringing us outside Pendellhaven Valley, and to be able to explore more cities, regions and countries within this vast world. In the long-term, all goals enhance Imperium Omni, bringing increased content, additional media and additional capabilities to the game.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>Who are StoryTellers Entertainment?</strong></p>
<p>StoryTellers Entertainment is the brainchild of author and game designer Matthew S. Thomas. Matthew Thomas wrote his first novel at the age of 12, and has written many others since as well as screenplays, poetry and cookbooks and won a finalist’s award in the Vanity Fair Screenplay Contest. But that isn’t the only way to tell a story. He’s also been an avid RPG gamer, both tabletop dice-and-paper as well as video games, going back to Zork and Bard’s Tale and up to the current crop of Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age and The Witcher. And while playing RPG’s is a passion, designing them is an even greater passion, as he was a presenting speaker at the 2012 Game Design Conference in San Francisco, game designer on two interactive-novel RPG games DUSK: A Vampire’s Tale and Phantom Government, as well as being a developer and designer on the social media game King of the World. The game Imperium Omni is his ultimate passion, the culmination of 25 years of design work now ready to be brought to life. “This is my life’s work, and now it’s time to let everyone else enjoy what I’ve dreamed of since I was a kid.”</p>
<p>Back in 2000, Matthew Thomas formed a company to create Imperium Omni, gathering together 20 of the top industry professionals to contractually sign on-board so he could seek alternative funding sources to traditional methods. Traditional ‘publisher’ relationships can be extremely restrictive, yielding control and design to external sources, along with giving up all rights to the game itself. Since that stands a high chance of ruining the quality and intent of the game, we went out seeking Venture Capital funding. During that quest, investor groups wanted to see us extract some of our proprietary gaming technology and have it provide the funding for the game. But since the technology itself hasn’t yet managed to deliver the required funding to pay for the development of Imperium Omni, we’re taking Imperium Omni straight to the people -- straight to The Crowdfunding Community! The Crowdfunding Community allows us to get our funding from people who love to play RPGs as much as we do, and those are the only people we have to answer to. And with The Crowdfunding Community fans as our backers, we can be open and transparent all along the way, with plenty of opportunity for feedback. And by letting everyone ‘play’ the game in advance through the novelized walkthrough, everyone can see where we are headed from day one.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>The “World” of Pendellhaven</strong></p>
<p>We begin in Pendellhaven Valley with the prelude short-story ‘Pendellhaven’. It is a full-featured story and a full-featured game experience complete with all of the aspects of the whole game, but narrowed to a wide and expansive valley in the Eastlands of Sashire. Not a demo, but a full size game experience in a vast valley filled with hundreds of NPCs, allies, friends and enemies. Hundreds of monsters and missions. There’s plenty to do and see there, plenty of people to meet, relationships to form, Concurrent Classes to join. There are temples and ruins, caves and mines, castles and palaces, villages, cities and towns. We've already raised over $35,000, which has allowed us to to fully flesh out Pendellhaven Valley.  We need to raise an additional $15,000 to hit $50,000 and expand outside Pendellhaven and get into the 'rest of the world'.   And the farther we go beyond our target goal and into our stretch goals of $75K, $100K, $150K and more ... the deeper the reach into that world we get, the deeper into the story, the deeper into the mysteries and majesty of the game. The greater the stretch goals, the more content! And the greater the capacity for content!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>Each of the Mystery Chests contain several different items of varying type, each of differing levels and powers based on which tier it is.  The chests contain random items.  Here are some of the possible items you may have in your chest!</p>

</div><div>
<p>What if you've already contributed, or you just can't contribute right now?  There's lots of other ways to help! You can get the word out and about our campaign by sharing it on your social media, and you can use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>There is no doubt that video games are complex software projects, however, the StoryTellers team has a combined 70+ years experience in software product development and software project management, and 20+ years of game programming experience. Our team of programmers have in excess of 20+ software patents among us. So our experience helps mitigate the risks associated with the production of a complex RPG game.</p>
<p>Imperium Omni's production schedule is designed to allow ample production development due to reliance on substantial pre-production design work prior to coding, and most importantly, the use of a proven, AAA-3D game engine, Unreal 4. The Map-Based elements are comparatively simple to code, and the 3D game engine itself is fully built and tested by some of the largest and most successful game companies on earth, we can rely on its set of streamlined development tools to speed up our progress in a bug-free environment. Since this game is inherently designed to be produced in specific stages, the limited scope of each stage allows us significant breathing room. And our project is free of any requirement for a third party to approve or review any of our rewards prior to release.</p>

We are excited at this chance to create something new, yet reminiscent of those great games and we want you to be a part of it as well.
Stretch Goals  - We reached our first target, now we need to hit the next goal of $50,000:  At $50,000 we expand the content, both standard and 3D, for the Pendellhaven Prelude. We add additional locations, items, map expansions and 3D interactions.  Once we hit $50,000, our second goal is $75,000 to expand the next sections of the serialization, one by one bringing us outside Pendellhaven Valley, and to be able to explore more cities, regions and countries within this vast world. In the long-term, all goals enhance Imperium Omni, bringing increased content, additional media and additional capabilities to the game.

Who are StoryTellers Entertainment?
StoryTellers Entertainment is the brainchild of author and game designer Matthew S. Thomas. Matthew Thomas wrote his first novel at the age of 12, and has written many others since as well as screenplays, poetry and cookbooks and won a finalist’s award in the Vanity Fair Screenplay Contest. But that isn’t the only way to tell a story. He’s also been an avid RPG gamer, both tabletop dice-and-paper as well as video games, going back to Zork and Bard’s Tale and up to the current crop of Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age and The Witcher. And while playing RPG’s is a passion, designing them is an even greater passion, as he was a presenting speaker at the 2012 Game Design Conference in San Francisco, game designer on two interactive-novel RPG games DUSK: A Vampire’s Tale and Phantom Government, as well as being a developer and designer on the social media game King of the World. The game Imperium Omni is his ultimate passion, the culmination of 25 years of design work now ready to be brought to life. “This is my life’s work, and now it’s time to let everyone else enjoy what I’ve dreamed of since I was a kid.”
Back in 2000, Matthew Thomas formed a company to create Imperium Omni, gathering together 20 of the top industry professionals to contractually sign on-board so he could seek alternative funding sources to traditional methods. Traditional ‘publisher’ relationships can be extremely restrictive, yielding control and design to external sources, along with giving up all rights to the game itself. Since that stands a high chance of ruining the quality and intent of the game, we went out seeking Venture Capital funding. During that quest, investor groups wanted to see us extract some of our proprietary gaming technology and have it provide the funding for the game. But since the technology itself hasn’t yet managed to deliver the required funding to pay for the development of Imperium Omni, we’re taking Imperium Omni straight to the people -- straight to The Crowdfunding Community! The Crowdfunding Community allows us to get our funding from people who love to play RPGs as much as we do, and those are the only people we have to answer to. And with The Crowdfunding Community fans as our backers, we can be open and transparent all along the way, with plenty of opportunity for feedback. And by letting everyone ‘play’ the game in advance through the novelized walkthrough, everyone can see where we are headed from day one.
The “World” of Pendellhaven
We begin in Pendellhaven Valley with the prelude short-story ‘Pendellhaven’. It is a full-featured story and a full-featured game experience complete with all of the aspects of the whole game, but narrowed to a wide and expansive valley in the Eastlands of Sashire. Not a demo, but a full size game experience in a vast valley filled with hundreds of NPCs, allies, friends and enemies. Hundreds of monsters and missions. There’s plenty to do and see there, plenty of people to meet, relationships to form, Concurrent Classes to join. There are temples and ruins, caves and mines, castles and palaces, villages, cities and towns. We've already raised over $35,000, which has allowed us to to fully flesh out Pendellhaven Valley.  We need to raise an additional $15,000 to hit $50,000 and expand outside Pendellhaven and get into the 'rest of the world'.   And the farther we go beyond our target goal and into our stretch goals of $75K, $100K, $150K and more ... the deeper the reach into that world we get, the deeper into the story, the deeper into the mysteries and majesty of the game. The greater the stretch goals, the more content! And the greater the capacity for content!
Perks
Each of the Mystery Chests contain several different items of varying type, each of differing levels and powers based on which tier it is.  The chests contain random items.  Here are some of the possible items you may have in your chest!

Risks and challenges
There is no doubt that video games are complex software projects, however, the StoryTellers team has a combined 70+ years experience in software product development and software project management, and 20+ years of game programming experience. Our team of programmers have in excess of 20+ software patents among us. So our experience helps mitigate the risks associated with the production of a complex RPG game.
Imperium Omni's production schedule is designed to allow ample production development due to reliance on substantial pre-production design work prior to coding, and most importantly, the use of a proven, AAA-3D game engine, Unreal 4. The Map-Based elements are comparatively simple to code, and the 3D game engine itself is fully built and tested by some of the largest and most successful game companies on earth, we can rely on its set of streamlined development tools to speed up our progress in a bug-free environment. Since this game is inherently designed to be produced in specific stages, the limited scope of each stage allows us significant breathing room. And our project is free of any requirement for a third party to approve or review any of our rewards prior to release.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>We reached our initial goal! Now it's stretch goal time!</h3>
<p><strong>$3000- </strong>I'll hire sound designer M Gewehr to make some sound effects. These will really bring the game to life!</p>
<p><strong>$3750- </strong>extra programming help. Being able to hire someone (possibly prototype programmer Sol Lutze or possibly someone else, depending on Sol's schedule) to do some of the programming will mean the game can get released faster!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>This campaign replaces the Kickstarter I launched in September and then <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/megancarnes/divinuet/posts/2622556"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">canceled a few days later</a> due to their union-busting practices. If any of the videos or anything mention Kickstarter, they actually mean Indiegogo!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hi, I'm Megan, and I'm a composer and indie game developer. I'm making a musical tarot reading game called Divinuet, in which the unique combination of cards in your reading generates unique music.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You might know me from my other interactive music game, <a href=""https://megancarnes.itch.io/inter-view"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">inter-view</a>, which I successfully funded on <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/megancarnes/inter-view-an-interactive-music-experience"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">that other crowdfunding site </a>a few years ago. Once I released it, it got a lot more downloads than I was expecting and even ended up getting featured in the <a href=""https://itch.io/blog/64793/itchio-recommends-relaxation-relaxation-relaxation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">itch.io recommends blog</a>! I had only wanted to make inter-view as a way to show potential game developer clients that I knew how to make interactive music for video games. Instead, I ended up discovering a passion for making my own games.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570055726/s8oqwlbzgrbomkwbg3xg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>It's inter-view!</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Right after I released inter-view, I knew I wanted to make another game, one with a more complex interactive music system. Tarot reading is something I love to do. The card art is so beautiful, and I love all the symbolism and meanings behind the cards. I'd been knocking around the idea of making some kind of tarot album for awhile. So I figured why not take that idea and make it interactive? Thus, Divinuet was born.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">(Side note: the title is a combination of the words ""divination"" and ""minuet."" Our sound  designer M Gewehr came up with it, so props to them for being ridiculously clever!)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How Divinuet will work</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Divinuet will be available on both PC and Mac via Steam and itch.io. I am going to try to explain how the game works best as I can, but I would definitely recommend either downloading and playing the prototype at the link below or watching the playthrough video below.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Divinuet has two phases: a reading phase and a generative phase. If you've ever done a tarot reading, or had someone do one for you, you'll have a basic idea of what the reading phase is like. You'll start by shuffling the cards, then the cards will be dealt, and each card will have its meaning revealed. Since music is the main focus of the game, there will be music playing throughout this. Most notably, I will be writing a little theme for each of the 78 tarot cards. Those will play when the card meanings are being displayed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You can listen to some of the tracks I wrote for specific cards <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/megancarnes/sets/divinuet-preview-tracks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> (all cups, because cups are often about creativity, so it feels right to include them).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">That's cool and all, but the second phase is where we get into the really fun stuff. Once you exit the reading phase and go into the generative phase, Divinuet will generate some music and art for you based on your unique combination of cards. Using magic! And/or math! The order of the cards even matters, so the music and art for a Fool, Magician, Priestess reading will be different from the music and art for a Magician, Priestess, Fool reading.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I plan on making two game modes. One will do the reading for you. The other will let you manually choose which cards you want. With the second option, you can do a reading with physical cards and then plug in your results to see what sort of music they'd make, or you can just play around and listen to the music for specific cards that you want to hear.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Try it out</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Since experiencing the game is a million times more valuable than just reading my attempts at explaining it, I've made a prototype for you! When you're playing it, just keep in mind that the full game will be a full-on experience, whereas the prototype is more of a ""hey, let me show you the basic functionality of this game"" type thing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You can download the prototype (for free, of course) via <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s0hry5u08m7f8jk/AAAMchPPX5vn0VlsANyIw-8la?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DropBox</a> or <a href=""https://megancarnes.itch.io/divinuet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">itch.io</a>. There's both a Mac and a PC version. Download the ZIP file of the version you need. The Mac version will have an app file, and the PC version will have an exe file. Feel free to email me (megan@megancarnesmusic.com) if you have any problems getting it to run!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If you'd prefer not to download anything, here's a playthrough video of the prototype. To skip the instructions and just see gameplay, skip to 1:17 in the video.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How your contribution will help</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The majority of the budget will go towards the production of the game, including (but not limited to) programming, art, and hiring instrumentalists to play some of the music parts. If we meet our initial goal, I will add some stretch goals to hire a sound designer, writer, and maybe even more people to help out! Other costs will include marketing costs such as website costs and application fees for indie game conventions and such, taxes, Indiegogo fees, and miscellaneous costs like Steam fees.</p>

</div></div>","We reached our initial goal! Now it's stretch goal time!
$3000- I'll hire sound designer M Gewehr to make some sound effects. These will really bring the game to life!
$3750- extra programming help. Being able to hire someone (possibly prototype programmer Sol Lutze or possibly someone else, depending on Sol's schedule) to do some of the programming will mean the game can get released faster!
 
This campaign replaces the Kickstarter I launched in September and then canceled a few days later due to their union-busting practices. If any of the videos or anything mention Kickstarter, they actually mean Indiegogo!
 
Hi, I'm Megan, and I'm a composer and indie game developer. I'm making a musical tarot reading game called Divinuet, in which the unique combination of cards in your reading generates unique music.
 
You might know me from my other interactive music game, inter-view, which I successfully funded on that other crowdfunding site a few years ago. Once I released it, it got a lot more downloads than I was expecting and even ended up getting featured in the itch.io recommends blog! I had only wanted to make inter-view as a way to show potential game developer clients that I knew how to make interactive music for video games. Instead, I ended up discovering a passion for making my own games.
 

It's inter-view!
 
Right after I released inter-view, I knew I wanted to make another game, one with a more complex interactive music system. Tarot reading is something I love to do. The card art is so beautiful, and I love all the symbolism and meanings behind the cards. I'd been knocking around the idea of making some kind of tarot album for awhile. So I figured why not take that idea and make it interactive? Thus, Divinuet was born.
 
(Side note: the title is a combination of the words ""divination"" and ""minuet."" Our sound  designer M Gewehr came up with it, so props to them for being ridiculously clever!)
 

How Divinuet will work
Divinuet will be available on both PC and Mac via Steam and itch.io. I am going to try to explain how the game works best as I can, but I would definitely recommend either downloading and playing the prototype at the link below or watching the playthrough video below.
 
Divinuet has two phases: a reading phase and a generative phase. If you've ever done a tarot reading, or had someone do one for you, you'll have a basic idea of what the reading phase is like. You'll start by shuffling the cards, then the cards will be dealt, and each card will have its meaning revealed. Since music is the main focus of the game, there will be music playing throughout this. Most notably, I will be writing a little theme for each of the 78 tarot cards. Those will play when the card meanings are being displayed.
 
You can listen to some of the tracks I wrote for specific cards here (all cups, because cups are often about creativity, so it feels right to include them).
 
That's cool and all, but the second phase is where we get into the really fun stuff. Once you exit the reading phase and go into the generative phase, Divinuet will generate some music and art for you based on your unique combination of cards. Using magic! And/or math! The order of the cards even matters, so the music and art for a Fool, Magician, Priestess reading will be different from the music and art for a Magician, Priestess, Fool reading.
 
I plan on making two game modes. One will do the reading for you. The other will let you manually choose which cards you want. With the second option, you can do a reading with physical cards and then plug in your results to see what sort of music they'd make, or you can just play around and listen to the music for specific cards that you want to hear.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A Bold Open-World RPG Experience</h3>
<p>The Harbinger: Awakening is a third-person, open-world, fantasy RPG that takes place on the fictional world of <i>Vahde</i>. Orphaned when your mother died giving birth to your sister, you have raised your younger sister, the prophesied Harbinger, along with the help of people from your home town, <i>Alwen</i>. When your sister is taken from your home while you complete the final trials as a warrior-in-training, you must step out of Alwen and travel across the <i>Five Holy Nations</i> and face against countless enemies with your ally, Bo, to find and rescue your sister. </p>
<p>As avid (and picky) gamers ourselves, we are hand-tailoring The Harbinger to be a ground-breaking open-world experience. The Harbinger focuses heavily on compelling narrative development paired with cutting edge graphics that immerses the player in a realistic and beautiful world. We are also working tirelessly to continue to develop our game systems, from Bo's traversal mechanics to combat, crafting, and more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619381217/nj5yu9knm9bbpqcipacm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Existing &amp; Planned Features</h3>
<p><strong>Core Mechanics</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Bo's Powers.</strong> Bo's abilities (<i>Bobilities</i>™) are going to be some of the player's most useful tools. Bo will have shapeshifting abilities, allowing the player to traverse the world in a variety of ways, including land mounts, gliding mounts, and sea mounts. On top of traversal, Bo will have combat abilities that enhance the player's experience. </li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619043572/gdf0fzmp9u2tds703ibj.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Early concepts of Bo's land mount and gliding mount forms.</i></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Enjoyable Combat.</b> We're tired of stale combat in RPGs, so one of the first systems we're putting full effort into is combat. We want to give the player a variety of tools to use in combat paired with an <i>evolving AI</i> that learns how the player fights. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Crafting &amp; Cooking.</strong> A staple in any open-world RPG game of similar scale, we are currently developing the crafting and cooking systems for The Harbinger. You'll be able to gather a variety of resources from across the world to use to make new gear and try new recipes. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Survival Built In.</strong> As gamers ourselves, we noticed that a lot of mods for popular open-world games add survival features such as hunger and sleep requirements, sensitivity to climate, and more. We want to provide those options to the player in our base game, so we plan to have toggleable survival features available when the game launches. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>World and Story Features</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Beautiful, Diverse, Realistic Open-World.</strong> Our world features five distinct nations, each with their own unique geography and biomes. Using the resources available through Epic Games, we're proud to be building a world that's beautiful and realistic in appearance. </li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619044196/a2udvivr85yiyybxcokf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>See more early environment shots on our website.</i></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Compelling Narrative. </b>With lore over two years in the making and writers working tirelessly to create storylines that are captivating, The Harbinger will provide players with a deep narrative without sacrificing the open-world experience. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Choices with Meaning.</strong> As the player progresses through the story, they will find that the choices they make when interacting with NPCs have a real impact on the world around them. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Quality Characters. </strong>A compelling narrative requires quality characters with it. That's why we are making sure the people you meet in the game don't feel like carbon copies of one another. Arrow in the knee, anybody?</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>There are many other features that are planned for the game, but we will save those for a later date, once these systems are more refined. It's our goal to create an incredible gaming experience with The Harbinger, and we hope you will come along with us on this journey! Keep reading to learn more about some of these features.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Customization</h3>
<p>One of the core design philosophies we are implementing into our development of The Harbinger is customization. This goes beyond standard customization to extend into customizable features that affect overall gameplay. Namely, we are planning on launching the game with a variety of survival elements designed to enhance player immersion. Each of these elements will be independently toggleable - you choose which survival elements you want to play with and which ones you don't. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Technical Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong></p>
<p>We plan to release on the following platforms. Please note that some platforms may require approval that we cannot guarantee.</p>
<ul>
<li>PC</li>
<li>Xbox Series X &amp; S</li>
<li>PlayStation 5</li>
<li>Mac</li>
<li>Linux</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Release Date:</strong></p>
<p>We tentatively plan to have the game fully accessible in Spring 2025. Demo versions will be available between now and the release date. </p>
<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>50+ hours of main quest content (7 Arcs);</li>
<li>150+ hours of side-quest content. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Engine &amp; Tools:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unreal Engine 4/ Unreal Engine 5</li>
<li>Quixel Megascans</li>
<li>MetaHuman</li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A Beautiful, Detailed, and Expansive World</h3>
<p>The world of The Harbinger has been built from the ground up to create a series of stunning environments for the player to experience. From intricate lore and worldbuilding, to a breathtaking environment built by hand, we are confident you will love the world as much as we do. Your adventure takes place in a small segment of <i>Vahde </i>known as the Five Holy Nations. Each of these nations has distinctly different environments and social structures, ensuring a comprehensive fantasy RPG experience. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619142466/wnt0n3le3upthtk9wf0w.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Valbora</strong> is the dominant geopolitical power of the Five Holy Nations. It is (quite literally) at the center of trade and politics in the region. It has some of the most fertile lands of the nations, temperate forests, access to bountiful resources, and a coastline that is unrivaled. Valbora is inspired by traditional medieval European society and culture. As Erin, you will begin your journey in the northern reaches of Valbora. </p>
<p><strong>Rengea</strong> is a peaceful nation west of Valbora, whom it has close ties with. Rengeans are reserved and respectful, and highly value loyal friendships. Much of the nation is covered in mountains and dense, misty forests, with its southern provinces being an icy tundra similar to much of Indevaar. Rengea is inspired by Eastern Asian cultures. </p>
<p><strong>Indevaar </strong>is a frozen hell, where the people are harsh and society is brutal. The people of Indevaar are vikingesque brutes who have managed to build a strange tribal society in the frozen wasteland. For centuries the state has been fractured by internal quarrels between the various tribes, but the Inden tribe has been able to hold unitary power over the various tribes for some time now. Indevaar regularly attempts to invade Rengea, seeking to claim more fertile lands and expand their influence. Its culture is loosely based on that of Nordic cultures. </p>
<p><strong>Sanuvar</strong> is known for the vast desert that spans most of the nations, and is home to harsh conditions rivaled only by Indevaar. A famine has been tormenting the people of Sanuvar for several years, pushing the nation to the brink of collapse. The elitist royal family of Sanuvar hoards what little food the nation can obtain, leading to additional struggles within the nation. Even still, the people of Sanuvar persevere in life, accepting the challenge of surviving when it ought be impossible. Sanuvarian society is based on Middle Eastern and Egyptian cultures. </p>
<p><strong>Aduran</strong> is the technological marvel of the Five Holy Nations, developing geothermal powered wonders thanks to the large amounts of volcanic activity found there. Surrounded by mountains, volcanos, and the sea, and far away from any of the other nations, Aduran can easily maintain its separatist stance while developing technology far more advanced than the other nations. Even with these great marvels of human creation, the country largely remains disconnected from the world, choosing not to engage in conflicts until absolutely necessary. Adurani culture is loosely based on Roman society, most prevalent in their architecture. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A World in Turmoil, a Chilling Prophecy, and Mankind's Savior</h3>
<p>Centuries after the world was created by the gods, chaos struck. In a desperate attempt to preserve humanity, they created an eternal soul to fight for mankind - the Harbinger. Over the course of history, the Harbinger has come to the aid of all against countless foes. This is one of those times. </p>
<p>Nations are raising their banners, people are dying by the thousands, the world quakes in frightful anticipation. The world is in need of its hero. A prophecy points to the player's sister, Elle, as the Harbinger, but she is far too young to carry the weight of the world on her shoulders. </p>
<p>As Erin, the player must complete their training as a warrior to protect Elle, but when Elle is taken from their home in the ancient mountain town of Alwen, the player must travel across the Five Holy Nations with their spirit golem companion, Bo, to rescue her. Erin and Bo will face countless foes, attempt to prevent wars, resolve struggles, and stop the return of an ancient evil. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619811286/armfzzqcgdpi3xhwtqgj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Quest Design Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>We believe quests should serve a purpose greater than ""just another thing to do."" That's why our writing team is working to design main quests and side quests that are more than just filler. Gone are the days of the generic fetch quest!</p>
<p>Our quests are built as chains of long-form quests that intersect and influence on another instead of the classic ""main quest,"" ""side quest,"" and ""miscellaneous quest"" setup that is too common in other RPGs. These long-form quest arcs tell naturally evolving stories that don't start and end with just that single quest. </p>
<p>That's why our philosophy on quest design is that every quest in The Harbinger should serve a true purpose. It should either expand the lore, the world, or the characters. In summary, each quest should make the world feel real to the player, or as real as it possibly can. </p>
<p><strong>A Patchwork World</strong></p>
<p>Because the game takes place across five different nations, each with unique inspirations from our own world, our goal with quest design is to create questlines that feel unique to different areas of the world. A character in the icy tundra of Indevaar will have different needs than a character in the scorching desert of Sanuvar, and our quest design is aimed at illustrating those differences, both for the main quest and side quests. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">People Crafted with Purpose</h3>
<p>Throughout your journey, you will encounter a large variety of characters. It's our mission to ensure the characters you interact with feel like genuine human beings. This starts with the use of MetaHuman to make our NPCs and having our writers craft highly detailed lives for the NPCs to further immerse you into the world. These colorful and intriguing characters are thoughtfully handcrafted to bring greater depth to our expansive open-world RPG. </p>
<p><strong>Important Characters</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Erin.</strong> You will play as Erin, a young adult training to become a warrior in the ancient mountain town of Alwen. Erin can be either a male or female, and the player will have customizable options regarding the looks of the character. </li></ul>
<p> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Elle.</strong> Elle is Erin's younger sister, and is prophesied to be the legendary <i>Harbinger</i> reincarnate. She has an affinity for baking and is incredibly kind. Since your parents died when you were both quite young, she has taken on a motherly role in the house, and is quite mature for her age. </li></ul>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Elle's complexion will change based on the player's customization choices for Erin.</i></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Master Arkin.</b> Master Arkin is one of five Master Warriors at the Warrior Sanctuary in Alwen. He is a father figure to Erin, and acts as the player's mentor throughout the Harbinger. He is strong, headfast, and confident, and is seemingly all-knowing. His wisdom and fighting skills are seemingly unsurpassed. He is keen to teach Erin all that he knows, passing down generations worth of knowledge to his favorite student. </li></ul>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Bo.</strong> Borem (Bo for short) is Erin's spirit golem companion and the player's most important ally. Bo will be by the player's side throughout the entire game as you travel across the Five Holy Nations, and his shapeshifting abilities will enhance the player's journey tenfold. Bo is snarky and sarcastic, and will often let the player know when he doesn't approve of something you've done. He carries a burdensome secret the player will have to work to uncover. </li></ul>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who is Blue Diamond Studios?</h3>
<p>Blue Diamond Studios (BDS for short) we're indie rebels focused on making a positive impact to empower other indies within the gaming industry.</p>
<p>BDS was founded by Hunter in late 2020. He has had a passion for video games since he first picked up a gameboy in the late 90s, playing Pokemon Blue. Hunter found a passion for open-world games when he first picked up Skyrim in 2011, devoting an admittedly unhealthy amount of time to exploring dungeons and getting sent flying by giants. After much consideration, Hunter formed BDS to tell narrative based stories in open-world environments with other like-minded developers. He is the Creative Director of The Harbinger, overseeing the full development and ensuring that everything from mechanics to monsters adhere to the lore and vision of the game. </p>
<p>Ricky was one of the first people to join Hunter on his journey to creating The Harbinger. He is the outgoing ""people person"" of the bunch, and serves as both the Director of Environment and Level Design, as well as the Human Resources Director for BDS. He handcrafted the environments visible in the trailer and screenshots, and is working hard to make them as stunning as possible. </p>
<p>Arianna was committed to joining Hunter before he even formed BDS. She is the Narrative Director for BDS, and works closely with Hunter to oversee the development of quest design, narrative direction, and character development. She is currently seeking her degree in playwriting and screenwriting, as well as minors in literature and film &amp; video production. </p>
<p>While these four are over the whole of BDS, we aren't alone in this journey. We have an amazing dev team that we wouldn't be here without. In fact, we currently have around 20 developers working with us on the game. We all consider ourselves close friends, and we all share the same dedicated vision to proving that a game like The Harbinger can be made by a small indie studio. We all share the same vision of changing the gaming industry forever. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Believe In</h3>
<p>We believe that the gaming industry has been divided by ""AAA"" and ""Indie"" for far too long. We also believe that indie developers can create the same quality of games that AAA studios can. The tools indies have at our disposal today rival that of the greatest AAA studios, and we seek to capitalize on those tools to prove this point and provide gamers around the world with quality gaming experiences.</p>
<p>That's why our motto at BDS is ""Because Indies Can,"" and we stand by that statement wholeheartedly. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Overall Goal</h3>
<p>Our overall development is planned to take 3-4 more years, with our planned release sometime in Spring of 2025. A game like this takes time, and we want to make sure that we deliver on our promises. </p>
<p>$500,000 is a key step in us reaching that development goal, and it will carry us into 2022. We anticipate that the total cost of our entire development will be close to $2,000,000 overall, or just at $500,000 a year. This means we have to be incredibly frugal with our purchases, and so every cent we earn will be carefully spent to ensure we maximize its utility. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We'll Use the Funds For</h3>
<p>The $500,000 goal is meant to carry us through the entire prototype and vertical slice stage of development, and then further into early 2022. All of the money we raise from this campaign is directly going to the continued development of The Harbinger. We want to be as open and transparent as possible with our expenses, so here is our planned breakdown of a full $500,000 budget. </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>$400,000-$450,000:</strong> Developer pay. We anticipate that 80-85% of the money we raise will go directly to paying our development team and contracting additional developers to help us see the project through the early beta phase. Even if we don't meet our full goal, we expect the bulk of the money to go to paying our developers. </li></ul>

<p>Even still, the campaign means more to us than just furthering the game. It means that we're doing something that has meaning and purpose to a lot of people. As a new indie studio, getting support is tough, so everything you can do helps. The support you give helps us financially and let's us know that you believe in this project as much as we do.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Next Steps in The Harbinger's Development</h3>
<p>Following this campaign, we are going to dedicate a majority of the funds to paying our current dev team and bringing on some additional help.

</div></div>","A Bold Open-World RPG Experience
The Harbinger: Awakening is a third-person, open-world, fantasy RPG that takes place on the fictional world of Vahde. Orphaned when your mother died giving birth to your sister, you have raised your younger sister, the prophesied Harbinger, along with the help of people from your home town, Alwen. When your sister is taken from your home while you complete the final trials as a warrior-in-training, you must step out of Alwen and travel across the Five Holy Nations and face against countless enemies with your ally, Bo, to find and rescue your sister. 
As avid (and picky) gamers ourselves, we are hand-tailoring The Harbinger to be a ground-breaking open-world experience. The Harbinger focuses heavily on compelling narrative development paired with cutting edge graphics that immerses the player in a realistic and beautiful world. We are also working tirelessly to continue to develop our game systems, from Bo's traversal mechanics to combat, crafting, and more.

Existing & Planned Features
Core Mechanics

Bo's Powers. Bo's abilities (Bobilities™) are going to be some of the player's most useful tools. Bo will have shapeshifting abilities, allowing the player to traverse the world in a variety of ways, including land mounts, gliding mounts, and sea mounts. On top of traversal, Bo will have combat abilities that enhance the player's experience. 


Early concepts of Bo's land mount and gliding mount forms.

Enjoyable Combat. We're tired of stale combat in RPGs, so one of the first systems we're putting full effort into is combat. We want to give the player a variety of tools to use in combat paired with an evolving AI that learns how the player fights. 
 

Crafting & Cooking. A staple in any open-world RPG game of similar scale, we are currently developing the crafting and cooking systems for The Harbinger. You'll be able to gather a variety of resources from across the world to use to make new gear and try new recipes. 
 

Survival Built In. As gamers ourselves, we noticed that a lot of mods for popular open-world games add survival features such as hunger and sleep requirements, sensitivity to climate, and more. We want to provide those options to the player in our base game, so we plan to have toggleable survival features available when the game launches. 
 
World and Story Features

Beautiful, Diverse, Realistic Open-World. Our world features five distinct nations, each with their own unique geography and biomes. Using the resources available through Epic Games, we're proud to be building a world that's beautiful and realistic in appearance. 

 
See more early environment shots on our website.

Compelling Narrative. With lore over two years in the making and writers working tirelessly to create storylines that are captivating, The Harbinger will provide players with a deep narrative without sacrificing the open-world experience. 
 

Choices with Meaning. As the player progresses through the story, they will find that the choices they make when interacting with NPCs have a real impact on the world around them. 
 

Quality Characters. A compelling narrative requires quality characters with it. That's why we are making sure the people you meet in the game don't feel like carbon copies of one another. Arrow in the knee, anybody?
 
There are many other features that are planned for the game, but we will save those for a later date, once these systems are more refined. It's our goal to create an incredible gaming experience with The Harbinger, and we hope you will come along with us on this journey! Keep reading to learn more about some of these features.
 
Customization
One of the core design philosophies we are implementing into our development of The Harbinger is customization. This goes beyond standard customization to extend into customizable features that affect overall gameplay. Namely, we are planning on launching the game with a variety of survival elements designed to enhance player immersion. Each of these elements will be independently toggleable - you choose which survival elements you want to play with and which ones you don't. 
 

 
Technical Overview
Platforms:
We plan to release on the following platforms. Please note that some platforms may require approval that we cannot guarantee.

PC
Xbox Series X & S
PlayStation 5
Mac
Linux

Release Date:
We tentatively plan to have the game fully accessible in Spring 2025. Demo versions will be available between now and the release date. 
Gameplay:

50+ hours of main quest content (7 Arcs);
150+ hours of side-quest content. 

Engine & Tools:

Unreal Engine 4/ Unreal Engine 5
Quixel Megascans
MetaHuman

This project is possible because of the resources provided by Epic Games to indie developers like ourselves. Unreal Engine 4 is allowing us to create an incredible game, which will only be enhanced by the release of Unreal Engine 5 later this year. Quixel Megascans and MetaHuman are also vital to our success, with both providing us with hyper-realistic graphics and assets. We cannot thank Epic Games enough for the tools they provide. 

A Beautiful, Detailed, and Expansive World
The world of The Harbinger has been built from the ground up to create a series of stunning environments for the player to experience. From intricate lore and worldbuilding, to a breathtaking environment built by hand, we are confident you will love the world as much as we do. Your adventure takes place in a small segment of Vahde known as the Five Holy Nations. Each of these nations has distinctly different environments and social structures, ensuring a comprehensive fantasy RPG experience. 

Valbora is the dominant geopolitical power of the Five Holy Nations. It is (quite literally) at the center of trade and politics in the region. It has some of the most fertile lands of the nations, temperate forests, access to bountiful resources, and a coastline that is unrivaled. Valbora is inspired by traditional medieval European society and culture. As Erin, you will begin your journey in the northern reaches of Valbora. 
Rengea is a peaceful nation west of Valbora, whom it has close ties with. Rengeans are reserved and respectful, and highly value loyal friendships. Much of the nation is covered in mountains and dense, misty forests, with its southern provinces being an icy tundra similar to much of Indevaar. Rengea is inspired by Eastern Asian cultures. 
Indevaar is a frozen hell, where the people are harsh and society is brutal. The people of Indevaar are vikingesque brutes who have managed to build a strange tribal society in the frozen wasteland. For centuries the state has been fractured by internal quarrels between the various tribes, but the Inden tribe has been able to hold unitary power over the various tribes for some time now. Indevaar regularly attempts to invade Rengea, seeking to claim more fertile lands and expand their influence. Its culture is loosely based on that of Nordic cultures. 
Sanuvar is known for the vast desert that spans most of the nations, and is home to harsh conditions rivaled only by Indevaar. A famine has been tormenting the people of Sanuvar for several years, pushing the nation to the brink of collapse. The elitist royal family of Sanuvar hoards what little food the nation can obtain, leading to additional struggles within the nation. Even still, the people of Sanuvar persevere in life, accepting the challenge of surviving when it ought be impossible. Sanuvarian society is based on Middle Eastern and Egyptian cultures. 
Aduran is the technological marvel of the Five Holy Nations, developing geothermal powered wonders thanks to the large amounts of volcanic activity found there. Surrounded by mountains, volcanos, and the sea, and far away from any of the other nations, Aduran can easily maintain its separatist stance while developing technology far more advanced than the other nations. Even with these great marvels of human creation, the country largely remains disconnected from the world, choosing not to engage in conflicts until absolutely necessary. Adurani culture is loosely based on Roman society, most prevalent in their architecture. 
 

A World in Turmoil, a Chilling Prophecy, and Mankind's Savior
Centuries after the world was created by the gods, chaos struck. In a desperate attempt to preserve humanity, they created an eternal soul to fight for mankind - the Harbinger. Over the course of history, the Harbinger has come to the aid of all against countless foes. This is one of those times. 
Nations are raising their banners, people are dying by the thousands, the world quakes in frightful anticipation. The world is in need of its hero. A prophecy points to the player's sister, Elle, as the Harbinger, but she is far too young to carry the weight of the world on her shoulders. 
As Erin, the player must complete their training as a warrior to protect Elle, but when Elle is taken from their home in the ancient mountain town of Alwen, the player must travel across the Five Holy Nations with their spirit golem companion, Bo, to rescue her. Erin and Bo will face countless foes, attempt to prevent wars, resolve struggles, and stop the return of an ancient evil. 

 
Our Quest Design Philosophy
We believe quests should serve a purpose greater than ""just another thing to do."" That's why our writing team is working to design main quests and side quests that are more than just filler. Gone are the days of the generic fetch quest!
Our quests are built as chains of long-form quests that intersect and influence on another instead of the classic ""main quest,"" ""side quest,"" and ""miscellaneous quest"" setup that is too common in other RPGs. These long-form quest arcs tell naturally evolving stories that don't start and end with just that single quest. 
That's why our philosophy on quest design is that every quest in The Harbinger should serve a true purpose. It should either expand the lore, the world, or the characters. In summary, each quest should make the world feel real to the player, or as real as it possibly can. 
A Patchwork World
Because the game takes place across five different nations, each with unique inspirations from our own world, our goal with quest design is to create questlines that feel unique to different areas of the world. A character in the icy tundra of Indevaar will have different needs than a character in the scorching desert of Sanuvar, and our quest design is aimed at illustrating those differences, both for the main quest and side quests. 
 


People Crafted with Purpose
Throughout your journey, you will encounter a large variety of characters. It's our mission to ensure the characters you interact with feel like genuine human beings. This starts with the use of MetaHuman to make our NPCs and having our writers craft highly detailed lives for the NPCs to further immerse you into the world. These colorful and intriguing characters are thoughtfully handcrafted to bring greater depth to our expansive open-world RPG. 
Important Characters

Erin. You will play as Erin, a young adult training to become a warrior in the ancient mountain town of Alwen. Erin can be either a male or female, and the player will have customizable options regarding the looks of the character. 
 

 

Elle. Elle is Erin's younger sister, and is prophesied to be the legendary Harbinger reincarnate. She has an affinity for baking and is incredibly kind. Since your parents died when you were both quite young, she has taken on a motherly role in the house, and is quite mature for her age. 
 

Elle's complexion will change based on the player's customization choices for Erin.

Master Arkin. Master Arkin is one of five Master Warriors at the Warrior Sanctuary in Alwen. He is a father figure to Erin, and acts as the player's mentor throughout the Harbinger. He is strong, headfast, and confident, and is seemingly all-knowing. His wisdom and fighting skills are seemingly unsurpassed. He is keen to teach Erin all that he knows, passing down generations worth of knowledge to his favorite student. 
 

 

Bo. Borem (Bo for short) is Erin's spirit golem companion and the player's most important ally. Bo will be by the player's side throughout the entire game as you travel across the Five Holy Nations, and his shapeshifting abilities will enhance the player's journey tenfold. Bo is snarky and sarcastic, and will often let the player know when he doesn't approve of something you've done. He carries a burdensome secret the player will have to work to uncover. 

Even more important characters can be found on our website! 

Who is Blue Diamond Studios?
Blue Diamond Studios (BDS for short) we're indie rebels focused on making a positive impact to empower other indies within the gaming industry.
BDS was founded by Hunter in late 2020. He has had a passion for video games since he first picked up a gameboy in the late 90s, playing Pokemon Blue. Hunter found a passion for open-world games when he first picked up Skyrim in 2011, devoting an admittedly unhealthy amount of time to exploring dungeons and getting sent flying by giants. After much consideration, Hunter formed BDS to tell narrative based stories in open-world environments with other like-minded developers. He is the Creative Director of The Harbinger, overseeing the full development and ensuring that everything from mechanics to monsters adhere to the lore and vision of the game. 
Ricky was one of the first people to join Hunter on his journey to creating The Harbinger. He is the outgoing ""people person"" of the bunch, and serves as both the Director of Environment and Level Design, as well as the Human Resources Director for BDS. He handcrafted the environments visible in the trailer and screenshots, and is working hard to make them as stunning as possible. 
Arianna was committed to joining Hunter before he even formed BDS. She is the Narrative Director for BDS, and works closely with Hunter to oversee the development of quest design, narrative direction, and character development. She is currently seeking her degree in playwriting and screenwriting, as well as minors in literature and film & video production. 
While these four are over the whole of BDS, we aren't alone in this journey. We have an amazing dev team that we wouldn't be here without. In fact, we currently have around 20 developers working with us on the game. We all consider ourselves close friends, and we all share the same dedicated vision to proving that a game like The Harbinger can be made by a small indie studio. We all share the same vision of changing the gaming industry forever. 
What We Believe In
We believe that the gaming industry has been divided by ""AAA"" and ""Indie"" for far too long. We also believe that indie developers can create the same quality of games that AAA studios can. The tools indies have at our disposal today rival that of the greatest AAA studios, and we seek to capitalize on those tools to prove this point and provide gamers around the world with quality gaming experiences.
That's why our motto at BDS is ""Because Indies Can,"" and we stand by that statement wholeheartedly. 

The Harbinger: Awakening Development Team
Currently, we have 21 people working on the game, either full time or part time depending on their circumstances. This dev team includes:

Hunter, Creative Director
Austin, Head of Development
Ricky, Environment and Level Director
Arianna, Narrative Director
Steve, Lead Asset Modeler
Anna, Character Modeler
Jay, Asset Modeler
James, Asset Modeler
Matt, Asset Modeler

Kyra, Writer
Mr. Mcclaskey, Writer
Zack, Character Design & Social Media Manager
Emma, Concept Artist & Graphic Designer
NihilAzari, Concept Artist
Matt, Concept Artist
Milan, Concept Artist
Riccardo, Game Designer

While a lot of our team members have dedicated positions, a lot of us are working in various areas to bring the project to life. We're all proud of the work we've accomplished so far, and are passionate about the work we still have left. 
 


Our Overall Goal
Our overall development is planned to take 3-4 more years, with our planned release sometime in Spring of 2025. A game like this takes time, and we want to make sure that we deliver on our promises. 
$500,000 is a key step in us reaching that development goal, and it will carry us into 2022. We anticipate that the total cost of our entire development will be close to $2,000,000 overall, or just at $500,000 a year. This means we have to be incredibly frugal with our purchases, and so every cent we earn will be carefully spent to ensure we maximize its utility. 
 
What We'll Use the Funds For
The $500,000 goal is meant to carry us through the entire prototype and vertical slice stage of development, and then further into early 2022. All of the money we raise from this campaign is directly going to the continued development of The Harbinger. We want to be as open and transparent as possible with our expenses, so here is our planned breakdown of a full $500,000 budget. 

$400,000-$450,000: Developer pay. We anticipate that 80-85% of the money we raise will go directly to paying our development team and contracting additional developers to help us see the project through the early beta phase. Even if we don't meet our full goal, we expect the bulk of the money to go to paying our developers. 
 

$50,000-$100,000: Additional business expenses. This includes things like upgrading our current repository, buying important tools and resources for the game, improving our marketing campaigns, covering necessary legal expenses (like trademark and copyright filings), and more. 
 

 
What this Campaign Means to Us
We've been developing The Harbinger for just three months now, with one full-time programmer and environment artist. The rest of the development team is incredibly dedicated, devoting as much of their time to the project as they can. The funds we receive from this campaign will allow us to hire the necessary people to increase our output and further develop the game. 
Even still, the campaign means more to us than just furthering the game. It means that we're doing something that has meaning and purpose to a lot of people. As a new indie studio, getting support is tough, so everything you can do helps. The support you give helps us financially and let's us know that you believe in this project as much as we do. This campaign means we aren't alone. 

The Next Steps in The Harbinger's Development
Following this campaign, we are going to dedicate a majority of the funds to paying our current dev team and bringing on some additional help. As mentioned previously, we are operating on a four-year timeframe for full development, with the game's release scheduled for Spring 2025. In the meantime, we have plans to regularly update everyone on the production, as well as plans to secure additional funding when it becomes necessary. 
 
The Next Year of Development
Our cumulative plan is to release a playable demo of The Harbinger this Fall. The demo will be free to play for anyone.
We also plan on releasing regular devlog content on our YouTube channel and website, as well as lore and other worldbuilding information so everyone can familiarize themselves more with the world we are building. 
We're also very excited that Unreal Engine 5 is slated to release later this year. With its release, we are hopeful that development will become even more streamlined and efficient, and that we can optimize the game further so that even more people can enjoy it. 
By the end of our first year, we plan to have the playable alpha completed. Upon meeting this goal, we hope to spend the next three years refining and polishing the game so it meets our personal expectations when it is released. 
 

 
Subsequent Years
Following this next year, the subsequent years will be spent refining the game's alpha, beta, and final stages through a series of playtests we have planned. Many of these playtests will be available to our backers only, and we are optimistic that when they come around you will all be excited by the progress we make. 
A lot of our time will also be spent working to either market the game further or secure some sort of publishing deal, as well as porting the final game to the platforms we plan to release it on. 
 
Thank You
We can't express our gratitude enough for taking the time to look over our project. We're very optimistic about where we're headed, and we hope you are too. We hope you'll stick by us through our journey to bringing The Harbinger to life. So, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you from the entire BDS development team.

You play as defense attorney: Tyrion Cuthbert who practices law in a world of fantasy and wizards. You must defend clients accused of various crimes committed using magic and use the rules of magic to prove them innocent.</p>
<h3><i>Defend Mages in Court</i></h3>

<p>The game borrows the base mechanics of <i>Ace Attorney, </i>but adds another layer of complexity through the presence of magic. The game features a magic system heavily inspired by tabletop games such as <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>. Magic and the mages who wield it follow very specific and detailed rules.</p>
<h3><i>Use the Rules of Magic</i></h3>

<p>Magic plays a pivotal role in how each of the crimes occurred. It is imperative that the player pay attention to how magic was used during a crime. By using the rules of magic, you can make deductions and prove if someone is lying to you.</p>

<p>One of the key features of <i>Attorney of the Arcane</i> is the Deduction Prompt. At every step of the investigation, Tyrion (and by extension the player) must work through how exactly the crime happened. Throughout the game, Tyrion will attempt to make deductions based on the facts that he's learned thus far. During these moments, the player will be prompted to enter an answer to the prompted question. With each successful deduction, Tyrion moves one step closer to solving the case!</p>

<p>Enter the Kingdom of Wyverngarde: a nation ruled over by an aristocracy of mages. Legends say that the Kingdom of Wyverngarde began as a small city-state located between two powerful nations. These two nations were at war with each other, and this city-state was constantly caught in the crossfire. The people of Wyverngarde worshiped the ancient dragons and prayed to their deity Bahamut for salvation. Whether it be by divine intervention, or by sheer coincidence, the last of the ancient dragons: Rathyn, appeared. Taking pity on them, he bestowed the power of the Arcane upon on a few select individuals. These individuals would later be known as the first mages of Wyverngarde.</p>
<p>With their newfound power, the village slowly claimed territory from the two warring nations. Weakened from their war with each other, both nations had no choice but to continue seceding territory. It was then that the Kingdom of Wyverngarde was established. And the mages who had brought victory went on to form the noble houses that currently rule over Wyverngarde. Wyverngarde enjoyed a period of prosperity for a time. However, generations passed. And the once benevolent noble houses became more and more corrupt. Using their authority, they began bending the laws of the land to their will. They abused the commonfolk that they once vowed to protect. And resentment began breeding among the commonfolk. It’s only a matter of time before these tensions come to a boil…</p>

 Tyrion Cuthbert: Attorney of the Arcane is a visual novel inspired by the Ace Attorney series. You play as defense attorney: Tyrion Cuthbert who practices law in a world of fantasy and wizards. You must defend clients accused of various crimes committed using magic and use the rules of magic to prove them innocent.
Defend Mages in Court

The game borrows the base mechanics of Ace Attorney, but adds another layer of complexity through the presence of magic. The game features a magic system heavily inspired by tabletop games such as Dungeons and Dragons. Magic and the mages who wield it follow very specific and detailed rules.
Use the Rules of Magic

Magic plays a pivotal role in how each of the crimes occurred. It is imperative that the player pay attention to how magic was used during a crime. By using the rules of magic, you can make deductions and prove if someone is lying to you.
Make Deductions

One of the key features of Attorney of the Arcane is the Deduction Prompt. At every step of the investigation, Tyrion (and by extension the player) must work through how exactly the crime happened. Throughout the game, Tyrion will attempt to make deductions based on the facts that he's learned thus far. During these moments, the player will be prompted to enter an answer to the prompted question. With each successful deduction, Tyrion moves one step closer to solving the case!
Examine Crime Scenes

While working a case, you'll need to travel to the crime scene and investigate. Collecting evidence will be crucial to acquitting your client. You may even find details that law enforcement missed during their investigation.
 

Enter the Kingdom of Wyverngarde: a nation ruled over by an aristocracy of mages. Legends say that the Kingdom of Wyverngarde began as a small city-state located between two powerful nations. These two nations were at war with each other, and this city-state was constantly caught in the crossfire. The people of Wyverngarde worshiped the ancient dragons and prayed to their deity Bahamut for salvation. Whether it be by divine intervention, or by sheer coincidence, the last of the ancient dragons: Rathyn, appeared. Taking pity on them, he bestowed the power of the Arcane upon on a few select individuals. These individuals would later be known as the first mages of Wyverngarde.
With their newfound power, the village slowly claimed territory from the two warring nations. Weakened from their war with each other, both nations had no choice but to continue seceding territory. It was then that the Kingdom of Wyverngarde was established. And the mages who had brought victory went on to form the noble houses that currently rule over Wyverngarde. Wyverngarde enjoyed a period of prosperity for a time. However, generations passed. And the once benevolent noble houses became more and more corrupt. Using their authority, they began bending the laws of the land to their will. They abused the commonfolk that they once vowed to protect. And resentment began breeding among the commonfolk. It’s only a matter of time before these tensions come to a boil…

</div><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>A Maniacal Game is a group of developers with varying
experiences that have been operating for just over three years. As we move from
our successful pre-production phase, we are very excited about our creative
development and what our next steps are including the funding of our software,
more dedicated server time and, of course, the work of our amazing artists.
Donations to AMG mean being a part of a team that has already successfully
launched one completed project and have begun developing our third. We are
always striving to improve ourselves and our projects with each passing
accomplishment.  </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>What we’re looking for is funds to cover the costs of state
taxes, our software licenses and any other operational costs that may hamper us
during our continued development of Screaming Eagles. If our goals aren’t met
the funds will go by the list already stated. There are many tiers for
donations and each tier will offer something different and unique which include
access to our multiplayer beta, buttons, stickers, wallpaper, t-shirts, the
original soundtrack, character booklets, company straight-jackets (yes we have
those), and opportunities to include original enemy and character assets into
the final game.   </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The Screaming Eagles Project takes the best ideas from the
top-down shooter genre and expands upon it. So everything that would be
familiar to bullet hell games like tough as nails action, empowering abilities,
gigantic bosses and flashy effects are present. Our additions include a larger
map to explore with hidden treasures to find, a 4 player cooperative
multiplayer that won’t make you feel lost in other characters, a fully
destroyable environment to leave your mark on, it is the first attempt at an
open world top-down shooter.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>There are always risks involved in Indie game development; we’ve
triumphed over adversity by adhering to the needs of our development staff. In
understanding their desires for personal finance and providing a creative
outlet, we’ve been capable of managing the development of this project for the
past two years. As a company to actually release a full project, we stand out
among millions of other developers that have failed. We’ve learned from our
past mistakes more than we ever could from our accomplishments and feel
prepared to fulfill the challenges that this project presents. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

We understand that some people just can’t help us with dollars but there
are other ways in which you can help. By spreading the word of our project and
letting people know about the opportunity to help us improve it will insure our
success to come. Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools so people may find
us more easily.<p></p></div>","Short Summary

     young cyber athletes can hone their skills and grow as players and people.
     The staff at WY Gaming League have made lasting friendships through Smash
     and would like to share those opportunities with people both here in
     Chicago and also across the world on our stream. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If the campaign succeeds, it shows that there is proof that people are interested in seeing the growth of youth eSports, as well as allowing ways to others to expand in ways similar to us.

<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>In order to achieve a more approachable Smash scene and get members used to the overall feel of the competative scene, we are crowd-funding for the following:</p><ul>
<li>Recording Equipment for Main Stream</li>
<li>Microphone for Commentators</li>
<li>Commentator Screen and Player Cams</li>
</ul><span style=""background-color: initial;"">With this equipment we can provide a high quality scene while also allowing over 30 people to play at the same time.</span><br/><ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Where's Melee/PM/64/&lt;insert game here&gt;?</b></p><p>As of now we have at least 2 setups for every game except 64 and Smash 4 and feel that Smash 4 would attract those who have never heard of Smash Bros. more quickly based on the testing we have done within our school. If there is something that you could do to help us with equipment for anything, let us know by emailing us at wygamingclub(at)gmail.com or tweeting us @WYGamingClub</p><p><b>What Could Happen Afterwards</b></p>
<p>So far, this has only been attempted
<a href=""https://life.indiegogo.com/fundraisers/super-smash-bros-youth-league/x/10738993"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">once in New York City</a> and we plan to continue what they've started and push
others to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the project succeeds, it will push the way for other
     students to form their own projects and to make gaming even more
     accessible</li>
<li>By getting our school involved, success of the campaign
     would cause a change in how games are seen in school</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Because we are still students, there
remains a long list of hurdles we are to overcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that we are students plays a great deal over
     the fact on whether anyone will take the campaign for how we are treating
     it</li>
<li>We take place at a busy school, so there is the risk of
     the board not letting us use the venue in the future</li>
<li>However, this all stems from the fact that we are
     willing to take the chance to see the change that we want</li>
</ul>
<p><b>After Hitting the Goal</b></p><p>Since we already have the venue sent up, it will not take long for the league to be set into official motion. If the goal if reached, we are prepared to start in the following school year (September 2015) and if reached early, we can start immediately in the current summer season.</p><p><b>Isn't $500 too small of a goal?</b></p><p>You can be surprised the prices for some things you can find on the internet! You can also be surprised what can happen when you handle problems in a group! By getting past our problems for systems, all that is left is funding for the stream equipment, which is around the same price of getting a Day-One Xbox One.</p><p><b>Isn't $500 too big of a goal?</b></p><p>We may have found the best deals for the equipment, but that doesn't mean that we are to get everything for pennies. The biggest hurdle is getting the streaming equipment in order to make it easier for a younger player to see that there is a community for them to start from and a safe place to be. That is why we chose $500 as our goal, for after Indiegogo fees, is exactly what is needed for the equipment we will use.</p><p></p><p><b>What happened to the $3,000 goal?</b></p><p>After a month of campaigning, we saw that sadly we were not able to move far from our goal so we had to downgrade from our usual expectations and worked to gather up the most expensive parts of funding. However, the biggest hurdle will be the actual equipment for streaming and making the league more accessible and that is what we are campaigning for now. Thank you to those who have helped us from the beginning.</p><br/><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Even if you cannot add towards the
funding, there still are ways you can help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let everyone you know about the campaign</li>
<li>Don't forget to share the campaign in order to increase its chances for success</li>
<li>Follow as it keeps the fundraiser relevant to the Indiegogo computer algerithms and allows more to see it</li>

If there is something that you could do to help us with equipment for anything, let us know by emailing us at wygamingclub(at)gmail.com or tweeting us @WYGamingClubWhat Could Happen Afterwards
So far, this has only been attempted
once in New York City and we plan to continue what they've started and push
others to follow:

If the project succeeds, it will push the way for other
     students to form their own projects and to make gaming even more
     accessible
By getting our school involved, success of the campaign
     would cause a change in how games are seen in school

Risks & Challenges
Because we are still students, there
remains a long list of hurdles we are to overcome.

The fact that we are students plays a great deal over
     the fact on whether anyone will take the campaign for how we are treating
     it
We take place at a busy school, so there is the risk of
     the board not letting us use the venue in the future
However, this all stems from the fact that we are
     willing to take the chance to see the change that we want

After Hitting the GoalSince we already have the venue sent up, it will not take long for the league to be set into official motion. If the goal if reached, we are prepared to start in the following school year (September 2015) and if reached early, we can start immediately in the current summer season.Isn't $500 too small of a goal?You can be surprised the prices for some things you can find on the internet! You can also be surprised what can happen when you handle problems in a group! By getting past our problems for systems, all that is left is funding for the stream equipment, which is around the same price of getting a Day-One Xbox One.Isn't $500 too big of a goal?We may have found the best deals for the equipment, but that doesn't mean that we are to get everything for pennies. The biggest hurdle is getting the streaming equipment in order to make it easier for a younger player to see that there is a community for them to start from and a safe place to be. That is why we chose $500 as our goal, for after Indiegogo fees, is exactly what is needed for the equipment we will use.What happened to the $3,000 goal?After a month of campaigning, we saw that sadly we were not able to move far from our goal so we had to downgrade from our usual expectations and worked to gather up the most expensive parts of funding. However, the biggest hurdle will be the actual equipment for streaming and making the league more accessible and that is what we are campaigning for now. Thank you to those who have helped us from the beginning.Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you cannot add towards the
funding, there still are ways you can help us:

Let everyone you know about the campaign
Don't forget to share the campaign in order to increase its chances for success
Follow as it keeps the fundraiser relevant to the Indiegogo computer algerithms and allows more to see it

</div><br/><br/><h2><b>Das Kartenspiel für Erwachsene mit dem lasziv-erotischen Kick<br/></b></h2>
Wir möchten für ein Jahr eine Auszeit aus dem Alltag nehmen, die Welt bereisen und viele spannende Menschen mit ihren Geschichten kennenlernen. Allerdings ist unsere Reisekasse nicht so voll, wie es nötig wäre.<br/><br/>So haben wir lange überlegt, wie wir das nötige Geld für eine solche Reise auftreiben könnten. Bis uns eingefallen ist: <b>Sex sells!</b><br/>Da wir beide als Erotikmodel sicherlich keinen Cent verdienen würden, haben wir uns mit der nächst besseren Möglichkeit beschäftigt: Ein Spiel mit dem prickelnd-erotischen Faktor musste her.<br/>Nach vielen Versuchen, ausführlichen Tests und viel Spaß ist es nun da - unser erstes eigenes Spiel mit Kribbelfaktor!<br/><br/>Nun muss sich das Ganze nur noch verkaufen - darum reden wir nicht lange um den heißen Brei herum, sondern stellen Euch das Spiel einfach vor:<br/><br/>Die Eisbrecher Spieleeditionen bieten ein aufregendes und lustvolles Erlebnis für aufgeschlossene und neugierige Menschen auf hohem Niveau, die auch spielerisch gern über den Tellerrand schauen: ob zu zweit, im kleinen Freundeskreis, nur unter Frauen oder auch in größeren Gruppen - die Einsatzmöglichkeiten sind vielfältig. Dabei werden den Mitspielern unverfängliche, aber auch durchaus sehr pikante und erotische Fragen oder Aufgaben gestellt - ganz abhängig von der jeweiligen Kartenedition. <br/><br/>Das Spiel ist so konzipiert, dass es auch für zurückhaltende Mitspieler problemlos spielbar ist. Es gibt jederzeit eine dezente Hintertür, um einer der 55 Karten auszuweichen. Aber Vorsicht: Diese Möglichkeit kann nach Absprache unter den Teilnehmern beliebig gestrichen werden - was Eisbrecher zu einem Spiel mit vielen Varianten werden lässt.<br/>
<br/>
Wir möchten Eisbrecher - Das Kartenspiel - so schnell wie möglich Wirklichkeit werden lassen. Die ersten Testeditionen sind bereits gedruckt und mit viel Spaß, Spannung und Kribbeln getestet worden. Damit wir dieses Spiel aber allen genussvollen Spielern dieser Welt für einen bezahlbaren Preis zur Verfügung stellen können, müssen wir eine entsprechend hohe Anzahl produzieren.<br/>
<br/>
<br/><h2>
<b>Unsere Vision<br/></b>
</h2>
Um Eisbrecher - Das Kartenspiel - produzieren zu können, benötigen wir insgesamt 7000 Euro Kapital. Dieses deckt die Kosten für das Design, die Druckkosten für die Karten und die Spielanleitung, die Verpackung, das Einschweißen in Folie und einiges mehr ab. Und wenn wir diesen Punkt erreicht haben, kann das Spiel einige Zeit später auch im normalen Handel erworben werden. Womit wir wieder da wären, wo wir eigentlich hin möchten: Auf Weltreise<br/><br/><br/><h2>Nutze Deine Chance, Eisbrecher als Erster zu spielen</h2>
Als Dank für Eure Unterstützung haben wir uns einige ganz besonderen Perks ausgedacht.<br/>
<br/>
Neben den jeweils einzelnen Editionen kannst Du auch für mehr Spielespaß zwei, drei oder sogar alle fünf Editionen jeweils in einer hochwertigen Schachtel erhalten. <br/>Nachdem diese Kampagne erfolgreich beendet ist, wird es dieses Spiel irgendwann hoffentlich auch im Handel geben. Damit es aber dazu kommt, sind wir darauf angewiesen, dieses produzieren zu können. Und damit Du auch eine Belohnung für Deine Unterstützung erhältst, haben wir den Preis während dieser Kampagne bewusst unterhalb des zukünftigen Kaufpreises angesetzt. Wer also wartet, bis das Spiel im Handel erhältlich ist, der verpasst die Gelegenheit, einer der ersten Eisbrecher zu sein (allerdings muss es ja erstmal so weit kommen, weshalb wir auf Deine Unterstützung hoffen).<br/><br/>Und um die Veröffentlichung des fertigen Spiels auch gebührend zu feiern, haben wir 100 Plätze für unser exklusives Eisbrecher Release Event reserviert. An diesem Abend werden wir Dir deine Eisbrecher-Karten persönlich überreichen, womit Du zu den Ersten gehörst, die dieses Spiel erhalten. Im Anschluss werden wir mit allen Eisbrecherinnen und Eisbrechern in die Spielewelt eintauchen und eine spaßige, lust- und genussvolle Zeit verbringen. Für dieses einmalige Event haben wir eine Location in der Nähe von Berlin im Auge, die wir exklusiv nur für unseren gemeinsamen Spieleabend nutzen werden. Es stehen allen Gästen verschiedene Räume, getrennt nach Spieledition, zur Verfügung. Wer bereit ist, die nächste Edition zu spielen, wechselt einfach den Raum und findet dort weitere Mitspieler.<br/>Natürlich ist an diesem Abend auch für Euer leibliches Wohl gesorgt: Getränke und ein köstliches Buffet stehen allen Teilnehmern kostenlos und ohne Begrenzung zur Verfügung. <br/><br/><br/><h2>Unsere Editionen im Überblick</h2><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1180258/files/20150128124331-Webgrafiken_Karten_Getuschel-Faecher_450px.png?1422477811"" src="""" style=""width: 462.132px; height: 419px;""/><h4>Eisbrecher Getuschel - für ganz alltäglichen Small-Talk unter Gästen oder Bekannten zum besseren Kennenlernen.</h4><p>Eisbrecher Getuschel ist erotikfrei und verspricht einen amüsanten 
und interessanten Abend unter Menschen, die sich vielleicht noch nicht 
so gut kennen. Du hast mehrere Freunde zu einem Abendessen eingeladen, 
die nur flüchtig miteinander bekannt sind? Dann ist diese Kartenversion 
für Dich perfekt, denn sie beinhaltet alltägliche Themen, die sich nicht
 mit dem Thema Erotik befassen. Schließlich will man ja nicht immer 
gleich mit der Tür ins Haus fallen, sondern sich vielleicht vorsichtig 
rantasten. Bei den Themen geht es z.B. um Urlaub und Hobbies.</p><p>
</p><p>Natürlich lässt sich Eisbrecher Getuschel auch entspannt unter 
Freunden spielen, um Dinge zu erfahren, die Dir vielleicht noch nicht 
bekannt waren.</p><p>
</p><p>Eisbrecher Getuschel ist perfekt dazu geeignet, um z.B. mit den 
durchaus pikanteren Eisbrecher Geheimnissen gemischt zu werden und

sind die Fragen schon leicht pikanter und durchaus erotischer Natur. 
Diese Edition lässt sich wunderbar von Paaren und Freunden, aber auch 
von sexuell aufgeschlossenen Bekannten spielen und sorgt für eine 
prickelnde Unterhaltung. Die Geheimnisse umfassen z.B. Themen wie 
sexuelle Vorlieben, die intime Vergangenheit oder Fantasien und Wünsche.
 Eine gewisse Offenheit ist dabei eine gute Voraussetzung. Lasst Euch 
darauf ein und lernt reizvolle Dinge über Eure Mitspieler. Und wenn die 
Fragen doch allzu heikel werden, gibt es immer noch eine persönliche 
Tauschkarte - aber sei auf der Hut, diese kannst Du nur einmal 
einsetzen.</p><p>
</p><p>Die Eisbrecher Geheimnisse lassen 
sich ganz wunderbar mit dem Eisbrecher Getuschel oder den Eisbrecher 
Damendramen mischen und bilden eine perfekte Grundlage für die doch sehr
 viel tiefer ins Detail gehenden Eisbrecher Tatsachen oder die Eisbrecher 
Züchtigung. Lasst Euch überraschen.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1180271/files/20150128124840-Webgrafiken_Karten_Damendramen-Faecher_450px.png?1422478120"" src="""" style=""""/><h4>Eisbrecher Damendramen - für Frauen unter sich, die sich gern über prickelnde Intimitäten und Sehnsüchte austauschen.</h4><p>Die Eisbrecher Damendramen bilden den 
perfekten Rahmen für eine ausgelassene Frauenrunde, in der das Thema 
Sexualität kein Tabu ist. Hier seid Ihr völlig unter Euch und könnt ganz
 offenherzig aus dem Nähkästchen über Eure Vorlieben und Erlebnisse 
plaudern. Dabei wurden in diese speziell für Frauen konzipierte Version 
auch Fragen z.B. zu erotischem Spielzeug mit aufgenommen, um der 
Spielerunde den gewissen Kick zu geben und die Spannung zu steigern.</p><p>Macht es Euch bei einem Glas (alkoholfreien) Prosecco gemütlich und 
freut Euch auf einen lasziven Abend - ob Zuhause, in einer Kneipe, im 
Urlaub oder auf einem Junggesellinnenabschied. Die Möglichkeiten sind 
vielfältig und genauso individuell wie Ihr. Schaut einfach, was passiert
 und seid offen und ehrlich, dann ist der Spaß garantiert.</p><p>Auch die Eisbrecher Damendramen sind ideal geeignet, um sie z.B. mit
 den Eisbrecher Getuschel Karten zu mischen und den Spielespaß damit zu 
verdoppeln.</p><br/><br/><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1180266/files/20150128124718-Webgrafiken_Karten_Tatsachen-Faecher_450px.png?1422478038"" src="""" style=""""/><h4>Eisbrecher Tatsachen - für mutige Paare und Gruppen, die sich gemeinsam auf eine lustvolle Entdeckungsreise begeben.</h4>Mit den Eisbrecher Tatsachen ist es vorbei
 mit dem Vorspiel, jetzt geht es ans Eingemachte und es gibt kaum ein 
Entrinnen. Lustvolle, erotisierende und intime Fragen und Aufgaben 
schaffen eine aufgeheizte Atmosphäre und sind ideal für das intensive 
Kennenlernen von Paaren und Gruppen. Gerade Swinger werden an dieser 
Edition Gefallen finden, da manche Karten sich nicht nur auf die eigene 
Person, sondern auch auf den einen oder anderen Mitspieler beziehen - 
prickelnde Spannung pur!<p>
</p><p>Aber sollte Euch eine Karte zu intensiv 
sein, könnt Ihr von Eurer Tauschkarte Gebrauch machen, aber um ehrlich 
zu sein - brauchst Du die wirklich? Lass Dich ein auf das Spiel mit dem 
Feuer und genieße die knisternde Atmosphäre, die in der Luft liegt.</p><p>
</p><p>Dabei gilt auch für die Eisbrecher Tatsachen wie für alle anderen 
Editionen - Ihr könnt diese z.B. mit den Eisbrecher Geheimnissen oder der 
Eisbrecher Züchtigung mischen und die Regeln ändern, ganz wie es Euch 
beliebt. Eurer Kreativität und Lust sind keine Grenzen gesetzt.</p>

<h4>Eisbrecher Züchtigung - für unerschrockene Paare und Gruppen, die tabulose LEIDENschaften erleben möchten. </h4><p>Mit den Eisbrecher Züchtigung Karten

</div></div>","Das Kartenspiel für Erwachsene mit dem lasziv-erotischen Kick
Wir möchten für ein Jahr eine Auszeit aus dem Alltag nehmen, die Welt bereisen und viele spannende Menschen mit ihren Geschichten kennenlernen. Allerdings ist unsere Reisekasse nicht so voll, wie es nötig wäre.So haben wir lange überlegt, wie wir das nötige Geld für eine solche Reise auftreiben könnten. Bis uns eingefallen ist: Sex sells!Da wir beide als Erotikmodel sicherlich keinen Cent verdienen würden, haben wir uns mit der nächst besseren Möglichkeit beschäftigt: Ein Spiel mit dem prickelnd-erotischen Faktor musste her.Nach vielen Versuchen, ausführlichen Tests und viel Spaß ist es nun da - unser erstes eigenes Spiel mit Kribbelfaktor!Nun muss sich das Ganze nur noch verkaufen - darum reden wir nicht lange um den heißen Brei herum, sondern stellen Euch das Spiel einfach vor:Die Eisbrecher Spieleeditionen bieten ein aufregendes und lustvolles Erlebnis für aufgeschlossene und neugierige Menschen auf hohem Niveau, die auch spielerisch gern über den Tellerrand schauen: ob zu zweit, im kleinen Freundeskreis, nur unter Frauen oder auch in größeren Gruppen - die Einsatzmöglichkeiten sind vielfältig. Dabei werden den Mitspielern unverfängliche, aber auch durchaus sehr pikante und erotische Fragen oder Aufgaben gestellt - ganz abhängig von der jeweiligen Kartenedition. Das Spiel ist so konzipiert, dass es auch für zurückhaltende Mitspieler problemlos spielbar ist. Es gibt jederzeit eine dezente Hintertür, um einer der 55 Karten auszuweichen. Aber Vorsicht: Diese Möglichkeit kann nach Absprache unter den Teilnehmern beliebig gestrichen werden - was Eisbrecher zu einem Spiel mit vielen Varianten werden lässt.

Wir möchten Eisbrecher - Das Kartenspiel - so schnell wie möglich Wirklichkeit werden lassen. Die ersten Testeditionen sind bereits gedruckt und mit viel Spaß, Spannung und Kribbeln getestet worden. Damit wir dieses Spiel aber allen genussvollen Spielern dieser Welt für einen bezahlbaren Preis zur Verfügung stellen können, müssen wir eine entsprechend hohe Anzahl produzieren.


Unsere Vision

Um Eisbrecher - Das Kartenspiel - produzieren zu können, benötigen wir insgesamt 7000 Euro Kapital. Dieses deckt die Kosten für das Design, die Druckkosten für die Karten und die Spielanleitung, die Verpackung, das Einschweißen in Folie und einiges mehr ab. Und wenn wir diesen Punkt erreicht haben, kann das Spiel einige Zeit später auch im normalen Handel erworben werden. Womit wir wieder da wären, wo wir eigentlich hin möchten: Auf WeltreiseNutze Deine Chance, Eisbrecher als Erster zu spielen
Als Dank für Eure Unterstützung haben wir uns einige ganz besonderen Perks ausgedacht.

Neben den jeweils einzelnen Editionen kannst Du auch für mehr Spielespaß zwei, drei oder sogar alle fünf Editionen jeweils in einer hochwertigen Schachtel erhalten. Nachdem diese Kampagne erfolgreich beendet ist, wird es dieses Spiel irgendwann hoffentlich auch im Handel geben. Damit es aber dazu kommt, sind wir darauf angewiesen, dieses produzieren zu können. Und damit Du auch eine Belohnung für Deine Unterstützung erhältst, haben wir den Preis während dieser Kampagne bewusst unterhalb des zukünftigen Kaufpreises angesetzt. Wer also wartet, bis das Spiel im Handel erhältlich ist, der verpasst die Gelegenheit, einer der ersten Eisbrecher zu sein (allerdings muss es ja erstmal so weit kommen, weshalb wir auf Deine Unterstützung hoffen).Und um die Veröffentlichung des fertigen Spiels auch gebührend zu feiern, haben wir 100 Plätze für unser exklusives Eisbrecher Release Event reserviert. An diesem Abend werden wir Dir deine Eisbrecher-Karten persönlich überreichen, womit Du zu den Ersten gehörst, die dieses Spiel erhalten. Im Anschluss werden wir mit allen Eisbrecherinnen und Eisbrechern in die Spielewelt eintauchen und eine spaßige, lust- und genussvolle Zeit verbringen. Für dieses einmalige Event haben wir eine Location in der Nähe von Berlin im Auge, die wir exklusiv nur für unseren gemeinsamen Spieleabend nutzen werden. Es stehen allen Gästen verschiedene Räume, getrennt nach Spieledition, zur Verfügung. Wer bereit ist, die nächste Edition zu spielen, wechselt einfach den Raum und findet dort weitere Mitspieler.Natürlich ist an diesem Abend auch für Euer leibliches Wohl gesorgt: Getränke und ein köstliches Buffet stehen allen Teilnehmern kostenlos und ohne Begrenzung zur Verfügung. Unsere Editionen im ÜberblickEisbrecher Getuschel - für ganz alltäglichen Small-Talk unter Gästen oder Bekannten zum besseren Kennenlernen.Eisbrecher Getuschel ist erotikfrei und verspricht einen amüsanten 
und interessanten Abend unter Menschen, die sich vielleicht noch nicht 
so gut kennen. Du hast mehrere Freunde zu einem Abendessen eingeladen, 
die nur flüchtig miteinander bekannt sind? Dann ist diese Kartenversion 
für Dich perfekt, denn sie beinhaltet alltägliche Themen, die sich nicht
 mit dem Thema Erotik befassen. Schließlich will man ja nicht immer 
gleich mit der Tür ins Haus fallen, sondern sich vielleicht vorsichtig 
rantasten. Bei den Themen geht es z.B. um Urlaub und Hobbies.
Natürlich lässt sich Eisbrecher Getuschel auch entspannt unter 
Freunden spielen, um Dinge zu erfahren, die Dir vielleicht noch nicht 
bekannt waren.
Eisbrecher Getuschel ist perfekt dazu geeignet, um z.B. mit den 
durchaus pikanteren Eisbrecher Geheimnissen gemischt zu werden und 
garantiert einen faszinierenden Abend.Eisbrecher Geheimnisse - für pikantere und intimere Details unter Freunden.Bei den Eisbrecher Geheimnissen 
sind die Fragen schon leicht pikanter und durchaus erotischer Natur. 
Diese Edition lässt sich wunderbar von Paaren und Freunden, aber auch 
von sexuell aufgeschlossenen Bekannten spielen und sorgt für eine 
prickelnde Unterhaltung. Die Geheimnisse umfassen z.B. Themen wie 
sexuelle Vorlieben, die intime Vergangenheit oder Fantasien und Wünsche.
 Eine gewisse Offenheit ist dabei eine gute Voraussetzung. Lasst Euch 
darauf ein und lernt reizvolle Dinge über Eure Mitspieler. Und wenn die 
Fragen doch allzu heikel werden, gibt es immer noch eine persönliche 
Tauschkarte - aber sei auf der Hut, diese kannst Du nur einmal 
einsetzen.
Die Eisbrecher Geheimnisse lassen 
sich ganz wunderbar mit dem Eisbrecher Getuschel oder den Eisbrecher 
Damendramen mischen und bilden eine perfekte Grundlage für die doch sehr
 viel tiefer ins Detail gehenden Eisbrecher Tatsachen oder die Eisbrecher 
Züchtigung. Lasst Euch überraschen.Eisbrecher Damendramen - für Frauen unter sich, die sich gern über prickelnde Intimitäten und Sehnsüchte austauschen.Die Eisbrecher Damendramen bilden den 
perfekten Rahmen für eine ausgelassene Frauenrunde, in der das Thema 
Sexualität kein Tabu ist. Hier seid Ihr völlig unter Euch und könnt ganz
 offenherzig aus dem Nähkästchen über Eure Vorlieben und Erlebnisse 
plaudern. Dabei wurden in diese speziell für Frauen konzipierte Version 
auch Fragen z.B. zu erotischem Spielzeug mit aufgenommen, um der 
Spielerunde den gewissen Kick zu geben und die Spannung zu steigern.Macht es Euch bei einem Glas (alkoholfreien) Prosecco gemütlich und 
freut Euch auf einen lasziven Abend - ob Zuhause, in einer Kneipe, im 
Urlaub oder auf einem Junggesellinnenabschied. Die Möglichkeiten sind 
vielfältig und genauso individuell wie Ihr. Schaut einfach, was passiert
 und seid offen und ehrlich, dann ist der Spaß garantiert.Auch die Eisbrecher Damendramen sind ideal geeignet, um sie z.B. mit
 den Eisbrecher Getuschel Karten zu mischen und den Spielespaß damit zu 
verdoppeln.Eisbrecher Tatsachen - für mutige Paare und Gruppen, die sich gemeinsam auf eine lustvolle Entdeckungsreise begeben.Mit den Eisbrecher Tatsachen ist es vorbei
 mit dem Vorspiel, jetzt geht es ans Eingemachte und es gibt kaum ein 
Entrinnen. Lustvolle, erotisierende und intime Fragen und Aufgaben 
schaffen eine aufgeheizte Atmosphäre und sind ideal für das intensive 
Kennenlernen von Paaren und Gruppen. Gerade Swinger werden an dieser 
Edition Gefallen finden, da manche Karten sich nicht nur auf die eigene 
Person, sondern auch auf den einen oder anderen Mitspieler beziehen - 
prickelnde Spannung pur!
Aber sollte Euch eine Karte zu intensiv 
sein, könnt Ihr von Eurer Tauschkarte Gebrauch machen, aber um ehrlich 
zu sein - brauchst Du die wirklich? Lass Dich ein auf das Spiel mit dem 
Feuer und genieße die knisternde Atmosphäre, die in der Luft liegt.
Dabei gilt auch für die Eisbrecher Tatsachen wie für alle anderen 
Editionen - Ihr könnt diese z.B. mit den Eisbrecher Geheimnissen oder der 
Eisbrecher Züchtigung mischen und die Regeln ändern, ganz wie es Euch 
beliebt. Eurer Kreativität und Lust sind keine Grenzen gesetzt.


Eisbrecher Züchtigung - für unerschrockene Paare und Gruppen, die tabulose LEIDENschaften erleben möchten. Mit den Eisbrecher Züchtigung Karten 
wird es jetzt richtig prickelnd. Diese Edition wird Paare
 und Gruppen begeistern, für die alle vorherigen Eisbrecher Karten das 
reine Kinderspiel waren. Diese Karten laden Euch dazu ein, Eurer Lust 
nachzugeben und dafür auch den einen oder anderen Schmerz mit Freude und
 Stolz zu ertragen. Hier werden Tabus gebrochen, über Grenzen gegangen 
und dem Verlangen freien Lauf gelassen. Lass Dich ein auf das Spiel mit 
der hemmungslosen LEIDENschaft.
Eisbrecher Züchtigung treibt das Eisbrecher Spiel auf die Spitze 
und verspricht ein unzüchtiges und aufregendes Spieleabenteuer - egal 
ob zu zweit oder mit mehreren, hier ist das Spiel grenzenlos und kann 
ganz nach Eurem Gusto gemischt oder verändert werden. Risiken & Nebenwirkungen

<div><br/></div> <p>Gem State Gaming Convention (<b>GSGC</b>) was created to provide the ultimate community gaming experience in Idaho. Co-founders Derek Howard and Sean Wainwright have dedicated themselves to growing the Idaho gaming community by working with friendly local game stores, gaming manufacturers, and other local conventions to offer the fantastic world of gaming to everyone. Our dream is to bring to Idaho what conventions like Origins and Gen Con bring to their communities.</p>
<p>GSGC is returning for its second year on <b><u>April 1st-3rd in 2016</u></b>, and with your help it can only get bigger and better. We'll be able to provide new experiences for attendees and guests, upgrade the services and technology for video gaming, and attract gaming manufacturers to join us in our cause. Let us introduce ourselves.</p>
<p>-Derek Howard loves to either run or help run conventions. After getting out of the United States Coast Guard Derek got into the convention scene through a friend. After helping run Tomodachi Fest in 2011 he got hooked and hasn't looked back. Derek loves everything that has to do with gaming, whether it's Role Playing games, video games, card games, and board games. Now the co-owner of multiple fan conventions and a staff member at others, Derek works hard to put on the very best conventions possible.</p>
<p>-Sean Wainwright became immersed in the tabletop gaming world one Christmas when his father-in-law brought a new game to the table each day for his version of the 12 Games of Christmas. Suddenly, games weren't just Monopoly and Tripoly anymore. 5 years ago, Phoenix Fire Games was born on that premise. Sean has worked hard to build the gaming community through partnering with other local game stores, volunteering with gaming manufacturers at conventions like GenCon and Origins, and outreach programs to grow appreciation for this great industry. He also runs the Table Top Gaming areas at many of the other local fan conventions. GSGC is the next huge step in this ongoing adventure.</p>

Crowd-run role playing games! Most RPGs are designed for 4-6 players with a game master. Take part in one where the roles are played by audience participation!

<p>Edsenses have been in the CG industry for about 5 years, we worked mostly for for visual on film and television. As we also did some of the game cinematic for some games. Here in Edsenses the artist comes from different background as some worked in Lucas, Blizzard, squaresoft, and Basefx. Artist with different background contributes the special part of the games, such as the bike racer, ship fighter, hand on combat and the 1st or 3rd person player. </p>
<p>We hope that with different set of experience artist working on different platform, and could come up with a game that gamer could experience a different kind of game play while enjoying the thrill of the story.</p>
<p>Our passion is our live, that is our purpose in life. We are going to create a game that we always wanted to play, as not just having a good story but also have a good experience playing the game.</p>
<h3>Our Plan!</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p>We hope that we would have a chance to introduce our project to you in the year end of 2015; currently we have produced a short trailer v2 which is the introduction to the world of TEOT. Then we are introducing which is still progress trailer that would introduce all the game capabilities and the difference of our game and current available games existed. We will also introduce you to the world of the project with our concept work and ideas propose. Mainly our target source would be going in to VR game-play and giving players first-hand experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Our plan is to 1st create awareness of the project to the public and within the process of producing the game, we would create a few mini games and trailers to the audience. For the completion of the game it will take 3 years, but within the 3 years production we will release started pack and then the expansion pack. Gamer could start playing while we in the process of developing it. And the gamer could continuous upgrade their game play without interruption. At the same time we could get feedback from the gamer in improving the game play and tactics of marketing our in game tools. With your help our project will flourish and there's a day in light in our heart in seeing the game come to life.</p></li>

<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>Our first thought is self funding, trying our best sleepless night to create our dream, but as we work further we realized that it will take quite some time before we could complete the production. But with your help we could boost our production and hopefully that we could finish and distribute the game in 10 months. We hope that we could change the way people are making games, by having different game play in a single story there are more challenges ahead for developer to create more exciting games.</p>
<h3>Where would the funding goes?</h3>

Brief Introduction We are creating a 1st and 3rd person shooter Game for Android, IOS which could be linkable to PS4 and XBOX ONE console with Virtual Reality capabilities. During the game player could experience playing as a first person shooter or a third person shooter option. And during the game the player could drive a simulated ship like the flight simulator, and also play the game as flight commander where shooting enemy ship from a first person view. Other than that in the game player could ride a flying scooter, drive a rover, and other vehicles while fight the enemies. Also best of all in the game in some levels there will be a hand on fighting combat where players could fight the enemy like Tekken! 

Concept Design And Introduction of the TEOT Universe:
Here are some of the Design we have been working on and there will be more. Also including some rendering of the game character.
Environment Design

Character Design

Tools And Props Design

Enemy Design



The Story

It was set in 2024, 14 years after the war, where the people is finding the true answers to what has causes the war. Still unexplained that what has started all this chaos, some people have their own theory, some said it was political benefits and some think it was the machines and some even mention about the aliens invade earth. However up till now no one knows what has happen. As everyone are just trying to survive each day, rather to think what's for the future. 
People started to see changes everywhere after the attack. First it was the machine that attack and govern them but somehow now organism are starting to taking over the breed of enemies. Enemies are getting larger and larger each time were seen. 
Human are taking refuge underground and those who still above ground, when seen would be exterminate or being turn into the being like a zombie kind. In many places people are trying to gather around and find ways to create a group of resistance, to fight for their family. some even turn themselves into a machine that can only live for months just to protect their family. 
Now the resistance have found a new info that could reveal what is the true cause and to eliminate it for good. This story would be about retribution. Getting back what has taken from them. The mission are:

Lead the army into the abyss
Protect the crew
Penetrate the enemy
Gather information
Destroy the source
Finally Escape

The Game Play:
This is an action pack and horror genre game.
The game would be split into 2 different version. The 1st person for the VR experience as of Examples:


and the 3rd person shooter which gamer would play as the character.



The game itself conclude a few ways of playing: 
Ship Simulation



Flying and Shooting from a ship



Riding a Bike



1st Person As Team or Zombies as Alliances



Sniper position View



Hand in hand combat



Riding TECHMECH


Also there will be a co-op in mission where players could connect and play the mission together.
The Team:

We hope that we would have a chance to introduce our project to you in the year end of 2015; currently we have produced a short trailer v2 which is the introduction to the world of TEOT.

Where would the funding goes?
The funding will definitely be funding the main production as now most of the asset is done and to boost up the programming side on Unreal engine.

<p><b>History:</b></p>
<p>The story is set in 2042 and begins after a zombie apocalypse. The player was born within a building not knowing what's going in against. Tains the game provides a limited number of weapons and accessible areas of the map will be limited. Most are overcome the hordes of zombies will be more able to raise the money, which will serve to buy weapons more and more powerful, more wide open areas of the map and activate the objects that will help the player to survive longer.</p>

<p><b>Rounds:</b></p>
<p>Every match is divided into rounds. Each round creates different mix of zombies and more the number of rounds increases the zombies become more numerous, strong and fast. unfortunately in the video presentation was not possible to enter the high round of gameplay since the game it has different lag and would result not fluid.<br/></p>
<p><b>Characters:</b></p>
<p>Inside the map, there are eight categories of zombies. Each of which has 8/9 animations depending on the game situation. Each animation recalls a specific function based on the action of the player and what happens in the game. So each character has such different death animations based on areas that the bullet hits him or has different attack animations and cammianata / running. Besides the characters have textures in high definition and many tris in a way that makes more probable movements and virtual reality. All the characters in the game are set in such a way that calculate the road faster and possibly amend it during the match to get to attack the player, so you can not hide. Each character his death releases money that goes to fill the portfolio of the player, not all release the same amount of money. This varies from the round in which the player is and the difficulties that will meet in killing the zombies. Also some characters to their death issue in addition to the money even objects useful to the survival of the player, such as ammunition, life, etc ..</p>

<p>Hi. My name is Richard. I am the owner of The Camo Dragon. I'm a veteran, a single father of 2, and a child grown in the heart of the Gaming/Comic industry. I've been a comic book enthusiast since the age of 5 when my Grandpa's brother gave me his comics he was done reading. Then at 8 during a summer camp someone I met (who would turn out to be my lifelong best friend) taught me to play D&amp;D from the old blue book when Elf was a character class not a race. In high school my History teacher introduced a group of us to Avalon Hill strategy games where I discovered a gift for tactics and resource planning. I have run campaigns, designed my own world, and discovered computer gaming (Civ and others). During my last 2 years in the military I discovered M:TG as Beta was released. When the pro tour started I played competitively (I still enjoy my Type 1 Chains of Meph/Stasis Deck). Upon leaving the military (Honorably Discharged) I worked conventions for several years to support my family as a rep for a major gaming company pushing books and LARP products.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">During that time I met and worked with a lot of great people including guests, con staff, dealers, writers, artists, game designers and others related to the industry. This time culminated with the opening of the first Camo Dragon store on my own in Chattanooga, TN. An investor believed in my business plan and vision (that was in 1998) and for three years the store did VERY well coming within touching distance of breaking even the first year then growing from there. Running the business was the one thing I was great at and this was before the Internet could be a large component of sales and a major leg that would support a thriving business.</span></p>
<p>Then I had to make a decision that was really no decision at all. I had to shut down the store to become a single parent and care for my son (he's now 25 has been to college and will be working the store with me). It was painful to walk away from the business I had built, but I did it for my family. I missed the people, the friends I had, and all of the contacts I had made - but I never once regretted it. After a time, I moved to Knoxville, TN for work. Every Friday FNM turned into time for my son and I. I offered advice to some of the small shop owners and tried to help them. It was a way to keep my hand in with the industry I loved. And I thought that would be the extent of it...</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The Details</h1>
<h3>Where the Money Will be Used...</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Currently The Camo Dragon has Comics, CCG Singles, Trading Card Inserts, Autographed Materials, Gaming Books, and a few Video Games available through other online sources (ebay/Puca Trade/TCG Gamer). To increase profitability we will change to our own website to make navigation easy and offer a wider variety without slowing down bandwidth. Each line will have its own section. This will consolidate our offerings to be easier to find.</span></p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>We will be adding product lines. Currently because we do not have open doors in a brick and mortar location there are product lines we are unable to offer. Distributors are prohibited from offering them to us by the manufacturers. We will remedy this with a location and  expand into CCG boxes/packs, and miniatures with accessories.</p>
<p>Creating the ONLY Anime viewing room and Anime Club in Knoxville. Currently there are no options other than mail order for local fans. It seems a tragedy that Knoxville hosts an Anime con but has no dedicated Anime offerings right here. We will be offering a large variety of DVD/Blu-Ray movies, wall scrolls, fans, figures, and just about anything fans might need.</p>
<p>General things: Tables and chairs for gaming (Heavy Duty Comfortable Chairs), Vertical displays (for maximum viewing and space saving), Custom Miniature Terrain and sundry other items for support of the store.</p>
<p>We will be building smarter not harder...</p>
<h2>The Perks:</h2>
<p>Our perks are generous. We developed this perk tree that way with a purpose. We are in this for the long haul and want people to extend the discounts through donations to 10 years or more if that is possible. This store will be happening! Personal funding will ensure that but there is a difference between open and thriving - which is where you come in. Negotiations for the location are almost completed and we are looking at May the 4th for the location opening. There is a Death Star grill that we are planning on acquiring to host a grand opening party with burgers and dogs. The discounts on individual lines are tailored to meet the needs of any gamer and their interests with an emphasis on building a huge online component to the business. So the Line Categories to choose from are:</p>

<h3>Additional Perks - The Future</h3>
<div>As I stated earlier I spent about 12 years working the convention circuit and working as a goodwill rep for a major gaming company. What this provided for me was a large number of people who were friends in the industry. As happens with life as it changes, paths change and diverge meaning you lose track of people. Since I made the decision last September to do this I have been reaching out to old friends and acquaintances. Mostly to remind them I'm still alive and to jog ancient memories.<p></p>
<p>As a result many of the Artists, Game Designers, Writers, Actors, and others in the industry have agreed to help me. They will be offering workshops, critiques, game sessions, play-testing, signed and original work, and other unknown help at this time.</p>
<p>ALSO - As we grow and are able to create dependable venues we will begin offering Camo Dragon Gaming weekends for cash. Just like the tournament opens, grand prix and qualifier schedule offered by other companies. It may take a year or two for those to get started but once they do they will be a pillar of the business on a regular schedule.</p>
<p>The upside of this for all you contributors is this - If you have donated to a tier where you have one of the aluminum Camo Dragon Keyfobs you will have access. For the tournaments, entry will be free with presentation of the Keyfob for life. If there are limited quantities of autographed stuff they will be offered to those with Keyfobs first then the general public. When there are events with a guest of some type you will be notified and if you are present will be included in private dinners, signings, game nights or other things that will not be available to the public.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A Last Perk Only For Active Duty And Veterans</h3>
<p>I spent 8 years in the U.S.Army from 1986 to 1994. Three and a half years in the Republic of S. Korea and three and a half years at 229th Airborne at Ft Rucker with a year-ish at Ft Eustis and Ft Dix for training. Being overseas access to any hobby materials is almost non-existent.</p>

<div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why This is Important...For All of Us</h3>
<p>Sometimes things happen. Life throws you curve balls and you roll with the punches and keep moving. When I closed my store just after the turn of the millennium (that's just fun to say...ahem) I thought my chance to build something from the industry I enjoy had passed. That having famous people on speed dial (No I will not name drop) was a thing of the past...glory days stories for my son to tell his friends for them to think he was cool as a teen. Then life changes again. A single snowflake tumbles and begins to fall down a mountain...collecting other snowflakes with it and eventually there is an avalanche. Well this avalanche is a new wellspring of life - collecting a lifetime of experience into a renaissance of sorts and a new beginning.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Reason...</h3>
<p>When two things contradict the only logical thing to do is create a solution.</p>
<h4>Thing 1 -</h4>
<p>As a parent it is a joy to watch your children grow. To begin to explore and be curious, to get into things you put away just because they want to know about you and the world, and to experience a sense of wonder and imagination. (Come with meeee...and you'll seeee...) As a single father of an intuitive, bright eight year old girl you are also protective. All the cliches apply here. You want a place for her to be safe and able to enjoy being creative. The crushing weight of the world can and should wait decades. She wants me to add her to my AD&amp;D game. She wants to go to the game store and watch me and her brother play M:TG (She wants to be the first female Worlds champion, on par with Melissa DeTora). She ADORES Superhero TV, Face Off, her comic books, The Hobbit/LOTR trilogies, and anything imaginative. She even came running into a game session after learning the Vulcan hand gesture yelling ""Live Long and Prosper! I'm the Queen of the Nerds!!!"" That's thing 1 and it is precious beyond all measure.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453968312/c9fwqycw6o5yiachf7i3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Thing 2 -</h4>
<p>Have you ever been to a game store that is PRISTINE...where they hover to wipe the glass of fingerprints if you point at a card? Or where as soon as you walk in the door they are looking to make a sale then push you out the door as quickly as they can? Where you are JUST a dollar sign and sitting at the gaming tables isn't allowed because it isn't game night? How about playing FNM where someone is going on about the horrible player they just crushed and how they shouldn't have even put the deck together - loudly so everyone can hear - they are thirty and the other player was 14? Or maybe the guy playing who always has a flask of ""adult beverage"" that is occasionally left open with minors playing next to him? Or the teens whose egos get bruised being beaten by a ""girl into girls"" because real girls support their boyfriends in being great not playing M:TG? Or the store that all the gaming books smell of cigarettes and the lighting is nonexistent - more like something out of an underground club? I've seen all of these things over the years here in the chain stores and as long as the profits are good nothing is ever said because the offenders spend money. That's thing 2 and it's an abomination to all chivalrous gamers. It's not an environment I want my daughter in...or anyone else's son or daughter either.</p>
<h4>The Solution...</h4>
<p>So after a 15 year hiatus...the only rational solution is to re-open a store. But not just any store...to re-open The Camo Dragon. Not a chain, not an exploitative profit grab, but a great quality, well maintained, safe for growth/creativity/learning, teaching new players the love of all the avenues of this hobby kind of store. A place that can grow itself, become larger and better over the years and support the whole gaming community.</p>
<h2>What I Believe...</h2>
<p>What is a gaming store? Or more accurately - what should a gaming store be to the community? It is my belief that a game/comics/hobby store should be one very simple thing. It should be a Pub without the alcohol. The staff should know their products and have a genuine interest in them. If a kid wants to come in to get his comics and discuss the latest plot lines then that should be a fun discussion for all involved. If a person wants to discuss the new combo for their deck they just figured out then the staff should be able to discuss it and its merits to help the player improve. Weather it is anime plots or 40K strategies and armies the people at the store should be able to discuss, help and encourage the player. Personality and an unfeigned interest in what players needs are - to me - is the hallmark of great customer service. This is the key to creating a store that services a community not a clique of individuals who own a store because they have deep pockets. </p>
<div><p></p></div></span></div>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Final Words and Thank You</h1>
<div>In closing I would just like to say thank you to all those who are making this store thrive from the beginning. The risk in this fundraiser is minimal because even if we fail to receive the full amount of funding (or more) the perks are easily fulfilled. This store will open whether this funding is 100% (or more) funded or not. The goal here is not only to have strong opening, but to expand and create a much more stable platform to grow from. Online will continue to grow, we will add other lines as able, and we will get there. What this fundraiser really does is build a community who supports us and in return we support them in as many ways as possible. It saves years of offering the services we want to provide from the very beginning. We understand if you are not able to donate - although you donation is certainly requested and greatly appreciated - But if you can not then please PASS IT ON. Send it to friends and family, use the Indiegogo share tools, send it to EVERY Military member - Soldier, Sailor, Marine or Airman - we are enthusiastic to ease their burdens with products to entertain, and just spread the word. Community is what we are building and community is what we want to invite you to join. Thank you and we eagerly await your business.</div>

<h3>The Camo Dragon Staff and Family</h3>
</div></div>","Welcome to the Camo Dragon Who I Am...
There have been questions I have received about the store and the campaign. How the money will be used, why I need help from outside Knoxville, how big a location I want and how it will be used to support the community. I'm happy to answer all these questions and more, but space here is limited so I have set up a blog to address these things in detail. Please visit the blog and send me any questions. I'll get to them as quickly as possible. Thank you for your support and belief.

This Campaign Is Flexible So All Funds Are Welcome & ALL PERKS WILL BE HONORED Whether The Goal Is Reached Or Not - Every Bit Helps.
Hi. My name is Richard. I am the owner of The Camo Dragon. I'm a veteran, a single father of 2, and a child grown in the heart of the Gaming/Comic industry. I've been a comic book enthusiast since the age of 5 when my Grandpa's brother gave me his comics he was done reading. Then at 8 during a summer camp someone I met (who would turn out to be my lifelong best friend) taught me to play D&D from the old blue book when Elf was a character class not a race. In high school my History teacher introduced a group of us to Avalon Hill strategy games where I discovered a gift for tactics and resource planning. I have run campaigns, designed my own world, and discovered computer gaming (Civ and others). During my last 2 years in the military I discovered M:TG as Beta was released. When the pro tour started I played competitively (I still enjoy my Type 1 Chains of Meph/Stasis Deck). Upon leaving the military (Honorably Discharged) I worked conventions for several years to support my family as a rep for a major gaming company pushing books and LARP products.
During that time I met and worked with a lot of great people including guests, con staff, dealers, writers, artists, game designers and others related to the industry. This time culminated with the opening of the first Camo Dragon store on my own in Chattanooga, TN. An investor believed in my business plan and vision (that was in 1998) and for three years the store did VERY well coming within touching distance of breaking even the first year then growing from there. Running the business was the one thing I was great at and this was before the Internet could be a large component of sales and a major leg that would support a thriving business.
Then I had to make a decision that was really no decision at all. I had to shut down the store to become a single parent and care for my son (he's now 25 has been to college and will be working the store with me). It was painful to walk away from the business I had built, but I did it for my family. I missed the people, the friends I had, and all of the contacts I had made - but I never once regretted it. After a time, I moved to Knoxville, TN for work. Every Friday FNM turned into time for my son and I. I offered advice to some of the small shop owners and tried to help them. It was a way to keep my hand in with the industry I loved. And I thought that would be the extent of it...


The Details
Where the Money Will be Used...
Currently The Camo Dragon has Comics, CCG Singles, Trading Card Inserts, Autographed Materials, Gaming Books, and a few Video Games available through other online sources (ebay/Puca Trade/TCG Gamer). To increase profitability we will change to our own website to make navigation easy and offer a wider variety without slowing down bandwidth. Each line will have its own section. This will consolidate our offerings to be easier to find.


We will be adding product lines. Currently because we do not have open doors in a brick and mortar location there are product lines we are unable to offer. Distributors are prohibited from offering them to us by the manufacturers. We will remedy this with a location and  expand into CCG boxes/packs, and miniatures with accessories.
Creating the ONLY Anime viewing room and Anime Club in Knoxville. Currently there are no options other than mail order for local fans. It seems a tragedy that Knoxville hosts an Anime con but has no dedicated Anime offerings right here. We will be offering a large variety of DVD/Blu-Ray movies, wall scrolls, fans, figures, and just about anything fans might need.
General things: Tables and chairs for gaming (Heavy Duty Comfortable Chairs), Vertical displays (for maximum viewing and space saving), Custom Miniature Terrain and sundry other items for support of the store.

Why This is Important...For All of Us
Sometimes things happen. Life throws you curve balls and you roll with the punches and keep moving.

That having famous people on speed dial (No I will not name drop) was a thing of the past...glory days stories for my son to tell his friends for them to think he was cool as a teen.

</div></div>","We are a team of skilled Anime, Manga, and Cute girl enthusiast. 
   This genre of game is not very well represented within the mobile gaming market, this is why it is up to our team to bring this game to the Apple and Android stores as well as Mac and PC, for Neko, cute, and anime girl lovers to enjoy.  Our goal is to create a beautiful and stunning game, which immerses you into a 2D Harem, that features high quality art, animation, voice acting and gameplay.
  This game will be fully animated and voiced and feature an original story that ties into the theme.  All your Nekos will have unique personalities you must cater to in order to train them. Once trained you can sell your nekos to purchase new ones, or, keep them.
   We plan to incorporate this story to have missions and goals within the game, and with constant updates, patches and improvements, there will always be something to do!

<p>We are creating a mix of survival RPG and weather forecast app. :)</p>
<p>Game features:</p>
<p><strong>- Unpredictable game process, it depends only on the user and the weather;</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Challenges mode: Be better than your friend while trying to survive in the most interesting places of the real world during a day;</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Find all game secrets and solve game main quest faster than other players.</strong></p>
<p>It has a scenario and a hero, named “Oliver”. How you access the game’s main quests is dependent on the actual weather in your real-life location.</p>
<p>Throughout Oliver’s adventures, you will think about your priorities and make decisions influencing the game process, but you will always refer to the weather forecast for several days ahead for guidance. </p>
<p>In the end you will have a lot of fun. You will also know whether to take along an umbrella for tomorrow’s walk in the park.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482047798/zmy82nwurpngqao6gokr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What exactly should I do in the game? </h3>
<p>An example: </p>
<p>It is the beginning of autumn, and you are living in rainy London. Your quest inside the game is to ""Help Oliver travel along the river toward the mysterious village close to the old forest"". You have to design a raft or a boat to cross the river. You therefore need to explore the map to find suitable materials, but don't forget that it is raining in London and you need to build your craft as quickly as possible. You will need to keep your fire going, preserve your food rations and shelter Oliver from the rain to maintain his health.</p>
<p>Oliver’s stress levels need to be kept low to enable him to work hard and effectively (explore, invent and craft). </p>
<p>As you can see, the game is about the chain of needs and unique situations influenced by the actual climate. We hope you find this idea as exciting as we do!</p>

We are creating a mix of survival RPG and weather forecast app. :)
Game features:
- Unpredictable game process, it depends only on the user and the weather;
- Challenges mode: Be better than your friend while trying to survive in the most interesting places of the real world during a day;
- Find all game secrets and solve game main quest faster than other players.
It has a scenario and a hero, named “Oliver”. How you access the game’s main quests is dependent on the actual weather in your real-life location.
Throughout Oliver’s adventures, you will think about your priorities and make decisions influencing the game process, but you will always refer to the weather forecast for several days ahead for guidance. 
In the end you will have a lot of fun. You will also know whether to take along an umbrella for tomorrow’s walk in the park.


What exactly should I do in the game? 
An example: 
It is the beginning of autumn, and you are living in rainy London. Your quest inside the game is to ""Help Oliver travel along the river toward the mysterious village close to the old forest"". You have to design a raft or a boat to cross the river. You therefore need to explore the map to find suitable materials, but don't forget that it is raining in London and you need to build your craft as quickly as possible. You will need to keep your fire going, preserve your food rations and shelter Oliver from the rain to maintain his health.
Oliver’s stress levels need to be kept low to enable him to work hard and effectively (explore, invent and craft). 
As you can see, the game is about the chain of needs and unique situations influenced by the actual climate. We hope you find this idea as exciting as we do!


What exactly are we paying for?
We currently spend all our spare time working on the game, while still fulfilling the demands of our regular jobs and day-to- day responsibilities. This situation inevitably impacts upon our graphics and art because these tasks take time. Working on projects spread across several locations also has an influence. With your help, we can undertake our work better and faster.
With your help:
- More animation and arts;
- New game process in which  Oliver will be able to explore the game world;
- More flexible gameplay;
- More languages support (german, spanish, french).
We will keep you apprised of every step and all developments. We really want Weathery to become not only mine and my team’s dream, but yours too. I hope we can do it together.

We’ve also prepared some nice gifts for you, for example our designer Varvara has made a t-shirt for you:

<h3>Indy's best unlimited play arcade.</h3>
<p>Boss Battle Games is an arcade and gaming center packed with some of the best games ever made, but we're a little different than the arcades of yesterday. All you have to do is pay admission and you can play as much as you want, all day long.<br/><br/>Since opening our doors 3 years ago we've become a community hub for gaming in the Indianapolis area. We've worked hard to bring you games you can't play anywhere else, and revive that real life community atmosphere that's been lost in the internet age. We want to continue doing this in 2019 and beyond, so we're moving to an even better location at the start of the new year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>We could use an extra life, or two.</h3>
<p>Over the past two years we've been saving funds and collecting arcade equipment to make our next location the hands down best arcade in the state. We've signed our lease, hired contractors to renovate the new space, and are working on getting more arcade machines ready for service. All the while keeping our current location running until we're ready to move at the end of January.<br/><br/>We've had so many people ask us ""How can I help?"" At the end of the day most people can't troubleshoot a monitor or install an electrical panel, so the best way you can give us a hand is by donating to the cause.<br/><br/>All donations we get will go towards covering any shortfalls we have when renovating the new space and getting our treasure trove of games in storage ready for showtime. It will also help keep us alive while we work through what's probably going to be the most demanding 4 weeks of our lives. We've got extensive electrical work that needs done, truck loads of arcade machines that need attention, less time than we need to do it, and we have to stay afloat if anything unexpected goes wrong. Anything that's left over, every single dollar we have, will go towards making the new arcade better in some way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>Giving Indy gamers a place to call home.</h3>
<p>Good arcades and gathering places for gamers are rare today outside of conventions and special events. That atmosphere is what we aim to create every day, right here in your backyard. We want to continue being a place where you can always find other players who share your hobby and passion for video games in a real life, face to face environment. By helping us get over this hill, you're helping keep the doors open to a community space for yourself and all your friends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>Life keeps increasing the difficulty setting.</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge right now is preparing for the unexpected. A lot of things have to go right for us to pull this off, and if there is one thing we have learned, it's that things rarely go exactly as planned. We really just want a safety net in case things go sideways and we come up short in some way, so we don't have to make any compromises in our vision for this new location. We've had a lot of our community offer to help, and this is the best thing you can do to make our jobs easier.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>Getting the word out.</h3>
<p>We could definitely use every dollar we can get, but letting people know about us and this campaign is also a huge help. Word of mouth has been our best advertising and that's not going to change going forward. Also visiting us, paying admission, and buying a used game or two allows us to keep doing what we're doing. Thanks for taking the time to read all this, and we look forward to seeing you in Castleton in 2019.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><strong>Project Explained</strong></h3><p>My name is Dmitriy Kushnir.  I am the author of such book series as The Slavic Way and Rodnover.  Time and time again, it has been suggested to me that building a temple where Slavic and Norse pagans (or heathens) can come together and honor their deities would be a good idea.  Recently, it was brought up yet another time.  So I said ... ""Why not?!"" ...

But this game is something special to us, because we really wanted to make something that our friends and family could use to help building up good brushing habits with their kids.</p>
<p>Our game, Tooth, does just that. You would create your character, clean and take care of it, and watch it grow with you. We wanted the game to appeal to kids, but also remain as a useful tool for parents who are not at home but still want to help their children build healthy habits to take care of their teeth.</p>
<p>We are aiming to release our game in January in the United States and Europe for Android and iOS. But that is for starters. Every child should be able to brush their Tooth in their own language, and this money would help to doing just that!</p> </div> <div> <h3>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Where are we at now??</h3>
<div>We are at 90% of the game now, with android release on Sunday and ios 2 weeks from then.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Over the past few months though, we've been going through different proofs of concepts, toying with different ideas, and most importantly making sure we do the research right!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As you play, your Tooth would have 11 different states of whiteness, 5 different stages of decay, 6 possible different eye sets, 10 different expressions, and around 9 different outfits. In order to take care of your tooth, you would need to use the toothbrush with toothpaste, floss, and use mouthwash in the right order. Even the outfits themselves change the world around you. The dental mask gives you a permanent discount on in-game items when worn. The kitty hat unlocks the kitty expression. The ninja outfit turns the background into stars and curled dragons.</div>
<div>With the push notification system, the Tooth would remind you when you need to take care of it, gradually becoming on key with your own brushing habits. With Tooth, we are gamifying brushing your teeth and making it an adventure that would last a lifetime.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>So where is that money going?</h3>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1109886/files/20141221060750-money_sheet.png?1419170870"" src="""" style=""width: 618.906525573192px; height: 1132px;""/></p></div>
<p>The reason we are doing this campaign is to raise awareness and funds for better advertising with Tooth.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The money though would be split under to categories with our game. We are going be releasing Tooth in the beginning of January for North America and Europe, with starting languages of English, Spanish and French. Our advertising budget is then split between the two regions, 50/50.</p>
<p>The 20,000 USD that we are aiming for would help pay for a month of advertising, with a split budget of 10k per region. We would be able to continue the advertising campaign after those three months ourselves, if the worst case scenario happens with us.</p>
<p>Out of the remaining 20,000 USD - 75% of that would be aimed at bringing more languages for our users faster. This would also let us gamify brushing your Tooth in more ways than before. More expressions for instance, or have it so that when you visit a dentist, they can take care of your in-game Tooth as well!</p>
<p>The remaining 25% would let us pay for development costs, like better music and sound effects for the game, more ui/ux testing to make sure it feels just right, and of course making sure that the team can keep giving it 120%.</p>
<p><b>But what are we offering?</b></p>

By selecting this perk, for either North America or Europe, your brand will be used by players and replace the stock equipment in game. In addition to that, the game in the zone of release would also have a splash screen of Sponsored by _______, and information regarding your brand in the ""About"" scene.

<p><b>Nitty Gritty Details</b></p>
<p>With our advertising campaign, we are putting the money at 25% to Facebook and 75% to Youtube to hit our markets directly. At 20k a month, that would mean that we can be showing our campaign to almost 400k people a month. With a conversion rate of 30% for Ads to App download average, we would be at around 125k registered app downloads a month. But then again, not everyone sticks around when they download a new game, which means that we have a 55% conversion rate of downloads to Monthly Active Users, or MAU for short. That leaves us with almost 68,750 monthly active users for the first month, almost 137,500 MAU the second month, and 206k monthly active users the third month. </p>
<p>This isn't taking in account the decline of monthly active users over a course of 4 months, and this isn't our best case scenario either. But what this information tells us though, is that we can reach our goal of universalizing education that much closer with your help!</p>

So over the dozens of different revisions, and versions that we made for this game, this was the one that stood out.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And as it stands now, we are at 50% to completion. The main gameplay is done, with bits and pieces still missing from the art and sound fx.

<p>This game has an end goal... Charge through the corrupted

finding new weapons, and
generally kicking ass on your way up the levels.</span></p>
<p>To accomplish<span>ment this, you will
join up with other players to share in a  battle </span>with, or against, the corrupted
government called S.I.C. On your adventure, you will face many challenges like:
huge bosses, epic battles, enthralling quest lines, and much more. As soon as
you set forth on your journey, you will begin making your mark upon the Realm;
will you be Good? I don't know, I think you might be Neutral. No, WAIT! You are
definitely EVIL! You get to have a say in which path you take, be the sweet
angel of goodness, the lazy ass of neutrality or the coldness of evil. It’s
your choice, so make it already!  <br/>
One thing is certain; you will have an amazing adventure in the world of
Tainted Realm.  Be prepared to laugh, cry and get mad!  Tainted Realm

<p><b><u>Pet:</u></b>
</p><p><span>Hey, mind your own companions!!!!
Didn't your mom ever tell you not to play with a stranger’s pets? I mean
really, you never know if that cute looking pet may actually turn out to be a
ferocious, flesh eating mushroom. Ain't lying, I learned the hard way! What do
you think happened to my finger? Well, try your hand at pet breeding. You can
breed just about anything. Keep in mind; you might not want to abandon that
ugly thing, for it might just be that super rare pet that will either haunt you
forever or save your ass in battle!  <br/></span><br/>In case you were wondering, all classes can have and breed pets. Now, I know
there are some non-pet lovers out there. Just see it like this: they might run
errands for you, pick up loot, or just be cute and cuddly. I even see some of
you using them as bait for bosses or you<span>r
scape goat as you run for your lives.</span></p>
<p>But seriously, whether you choose to
breed, own, or sell your pets,  we want you to have a blast, dang it!
Don't forget to pick up ""treats"" at the black market; we all love

Do you like PvP? Would you like to call your guild the best? Would you like to

where your mouth is<span>.</span></p>
<p><br/>
<b><u>BlackMarket:</u></b></p>
<p>Traveling around the Realm<span>, you’ll find yourself needing to
restock your supplies or find that special part you need to create your next
weapon.  You’ll head on in to town and find the Black Market kiosk.
 This machine will open a world of trade to you.  Buy or sell, and gain
all that you hope for.  You won’t have any trouble finding what you need,
just type it in... no need to spell it correctly; and you’ll see all available
items shown in a column.  Starting from those closing soon, all the way

quick and clean.</span></p><span><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441073570/l8ecfcxumtpeqbdacft5.png"" src="""" style=""width: 240.12px; height: 321px;""/></p></span>

beauty; weapons, materials and mounts.  You’ll find everything you need
for life in Tainted Realm.  There’s no dealing here though, the price tag
seldom changes.  You pay for the glitz and glam.  If you want it
enough, then you’ll find a way to pay.  Dig deep into your pockets so you
can plan ahead for that next house party or fashion battle.</span></p>

<br/>
<b><u>Who the heck are you?:</u></b>
<br/><br/>I am the badass. Need me to save
you? Take all those hits and be your prince in shining armor? Well, shove off.
I come from Fortify, the hidden stronghold. Serious<span>ly though, do not mess with me. I am a freaking paladin. I got
swords, knives, axes, hammers, or do you really want to be thunked over the
head with my staff? </span></p>
<p>RAWR!! Ignore the egomaniac. Can I
help you? Crushitaur my companion here thinks he is the strong one. Oh did I
not introduce myself? I'm a beast master. My style is working together with
nature and battle companions. If you like<span>, I can teach you hand to hand combat or some types of magic.
Please feel free to visit my home in New Forest. </span></p>
<p>Yeah, you really heard the rattles
of bones. Meet me, the Deadeye from BoneYard. Unlike them, I like to be ranged
and use things like bows and small magic. Want to see something cool? Look, all
my arrows are made from bone, that's from a thigh bone, this is from deer
antler, and this is a human arm. Oh, you think it’s creepy? That's ok. See<span>, I just try to kill things fast and
limit what Mr. Macho and Mr. Furball over there have to keep away from me. </span></p>
<p>Oh, do you think I'm beautiful?
Well, I should be. I do magic. This means unlike these dimwits, I am the best
mage around, a prophet. I stand in the background and amaze all with my power
as multitudes fall before me. Sunken Cove is my home. Feel free to find it. </p>
<p>Oh yeah, my bad, meet my counterpart
Mr. Shaman. You need him. Although, all that lazy ass does is sit on the ground
chanting weird things. But, it does keep your life force up. See, he can even
get rid of that epic poison ivy rash you got. Show’em your glaive while you’re
at it. He comes from Marshlands<span>,
so visit if you ever get near. </span></p>
<p>Grunt, well no team is complete
without me. Forget Mr. Paladin and others. Watch! Are you impressed? I'm a
shape shifter. See you get the handsome and the furry all in one. Ok, I'll
admit, I may not have the magic power as them but I use swords, axes, and
shit<span>, but I even fight with my
claws. I know awesome, right? Feel free to visit my home in the
pit. Yeah, you  know it baby! I'm from Ground Zero. </span></p>
<p>Ewww, reeks of death? That's what
you’re thinking right? Dead on. I'm a <span>Necromancer.
Visit my corpse collection in Haunted Island. One day when these fools die, my
kids will play with their corpses. Yeah, got a death reaper scythe, what you
got?</span></p>
<p>Boo?  Ahh, poor poor thing, did
I scare you? I'm a ninja. My home lies far away in the Temple Ruins. I
specialize in poofing! Ok, sounds uncool<span>,
but yeah I said it. Need someone
to sneak around, I'm your man. But about the whole fighting thing.. I think
imma stay in the background with my cool throwing stars, daggers, and brass
knuckles. </span></p>
<p>Bang, your dead. Sorry buddy, the
shadows are mine. I'm a joker<span>;
if you’re looking for me, DON'T!
But, some of my familiar haunts are in Metropolitan. I specialize in pistols,
cudgels, and knives. I prefer not to be seen at all. If I work with others, I can easily identify and remove
high priority targets. </span></p>
<p>Well guys, see this mismatched team?
Choose your favorite and do your thing! Own it and make it yours! Welcome to
Tainted Realm!</p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Customizations:</u></b></p>
<p>Imagine being able to do the normal
game customizations but with great depth. Take 5 people in a row in an MMO and
3 out of the 5 look the same. This <span>INFURIATES
me! Has anyone felt this way? Here at Tainted  that’s what we want!  Complete control of what our characters
look like.  You can make one arm longer than the other, put a third eye in
the middle of your forehead.  Look as real to life or as anime as a
cartoon.  Implants, scars, tattoo’s are just some of the details that you
will be able to use to create your ideal character.  Height, weight, skin
colour, class.  Our default looks will be as varied as we can create, just
so your imagination can take over and make changes that pop into your mind.
 What if you want to be a Archer that looked human or robotic?  You
can, you can look any way you choose.  You don’t have to be bound to one
kind of physical appearance, or one kind of clothing.  Your totally
customizable character can dress in any kind of style you dream of.  You
want to look like a Knight or a cyberpunk dancer?.. go for it.  You want
to look like a goth or emo?... it shall be so.  You like the designs on
that male character’s pants?  Well you can wear them too, no matter if you’re male or female.</span></p>
<p><br/>
<b><u>Who is S.I.C.: </u></b></p>
<p>Superior Intelligence Corporation is
what S.I.C. stands for.  Imagine FBI, CIA, Army and Government liaisons,
all rolled into one and as evil as can be.  There is no justice under the
watch of the S.I.C.  Their leader is ruthless and cold hearted.  He
will stop at nothing to achieve world domination!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441073808/illw9wkr2ivpcyfsrvvy.png"" src="""" style=""width: 222.79px; height: 396px;""/></p>

<p><b><u>Team:</u></b></p>
<p>“Play games with meeeeeee!” This is
a commonly heard phrase during break time from working on Tainted Realm. While
playing<span>, we know how the GMs are
nonexistent in most games or how Customer Service just ignores you. There are
so many limits and so much frustration that these huge gaming companies do not
address. You would hear, “that isn't possible!” “How'd you shoot me through the
wall?” Or.. In my case... “Booooosssssssss!! I fell through the floor again!”
as Samantha facepalms and repeatedly says, “Mark, Mark, Mark”. These are such
small things to fix. We will fix them; mainly because as a gamer it would drive
me crazy. </span></p>
<p>For real though, if Samantha sings,
""I like to move it move it” one more time. THE COFFEE WILL BE HIDDEN!
Needless to say<span>, we all have met
each other along our game play and have formed some amazing friendships.</span></p>
<p>We met some people who have come and
gone but these goofy people have always and will always be here. We love gaming
with and against each other so much that no matter if we win or lose, we never
rage. We have come from all over the world USA, Madagascar, and New Zealand. </p>
<p>As we sit here and drool from the
hot voice which comes from Andrea<span>’s
mouth, we continue to work on
Tainted Realm and know with our different genre likes and game playing, we will
bring different styles of creativity to Tainted Realm.</span></p>
<p>Many times when we are finishing up
a meeting you will hear a man’s voice saying “Bye Felicia” with an attitude.
This is the signature of our Nick<span>,
and it wouldn’t be a meeting without hearing that funny send-off.</span></p>
<p>If you would like to know a little
bit more about this silly but wonderful group<span>, please visits us on our website: <a href=""http://www.taintedrealm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.taintedrealm.com</a></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441077622/tawotxalezajhpprqcnq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><br/>
<b><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></b>
<p>We are a team of 4 that is putting
together an MMORPG that will cost<span>s
thousands of dollars before we can consider the possibilities of releasing an
alpha testing map. We all have our own personal expenses and we are trying to
build this game off of limited funding;
this is why we have come to Indiegogo, where we can go directly to the people
who love to play MMORPGs as much as we do.</span></p>
<p>Our team is comprised from all
around the world. From the United States greater area all the way to New
Zealand. We are working off of limited technology and experience. With the
funding we receive<span>, we will be
able to hire more experienced personnel as well as upgraded software.</span></p>
<p><br/>
<b><u>Other Ways You Can help:</u></b></p>
<p><br/>
We know that not everyone can make a donation<span>, but that doesn't mean you can't help us. We are asking for you
all to make some noise and to share our campaign.</span></p>
<p>One of the great things you can
utilize here at Indiegogo is their tools to help you share our campaign.</p>

battle other guilds and get free stuff? So come on down and put your weapon
where your mouth is.

BlackMarket:
Traveling around the Realm, you’ll find yourself needing to
restock your supplies or find that special part you need to create your next
weapon.  You’ll head on in to town and find the Black Market kiosk.
 This machine will open a world of trade to you.  Buy or sell, and gain
all that you hope for.  You won’t have any trouble finding what you need,
just type it in... no need to spell it correctly; and you’ll see all available
items shown in a column.  Starting from those closing soon, all the way
down to those most recently added to the Black Market.  It’s dealing made simple; as well as
quick and clean.

Emporium:
The Emporium is the biggest Mall in all of Tainted Realm.
 Well actually it’s the only mall.  It’s glitz and glam for your characters enjoyment.  Fashion and
beauty; weapons, materials and mounts.  You’ll find everything you need
for life in Tainted Realm.  There’s no dealing here though, the price tag
seldom changes.  You pay for the glitz and glam.  If you want it
enough, then you’ll find a way to pay.  Dig deep into your pockets so you
can plan ahead for that next house party or fashion battle.
Our game is not going to be subscription based. However, we will have VIP options to allowed different perks for different VIP levels. Also we will be providing different
items in our Emporium.
                                              

Who the heck are you?:
I am the badass. Need me to save
you? Take all those hits and be your prince in shining armor? Well, shove off.
I come from Fortify, the hidden stronghold. Seriously though, do not mess with me. I am a freaking paladin. I got
swords, knives, axes, hammers, or do you really want to be thunked over the
head with my staff? 
RAWR!! Ignore the egomaniac. Can I
help you? Crushitaur my companion here thinks he is the strong one. Oh did I
not introduce myself? I'm a beast master. My style is working together with
nature and battle companions. If you like, I can teach you hand to hand combat or some types of magic.
Please feel free to visit my home in New Forest. 
Yeah, you really heard the rattles
of bones. Meet me, the Deadeye from BoneYard. Unlike them, I like to be ranged
and use things like bows and small magic. Want to see something cool? Look, all
my arrows are made from bone, that's from a thigh bone, this is from deer
antler, and this is a human arm. Oh, you think it’s creepy? That's ok. See, I just try to kill things fast and
limit what Mr. Macho and Mr. Furball over there have to keep away from me. 
Oh, do you think I'm beautiful?
Well, I should be. I do magic. This means unlike these dimwits, I am the best
mage around, a prophet. I stand in the background and amaze all with my power
as multitudes fall before me. Sunken Cove is my home. Feel free to find it. 
Oh yeah, my bad, meet my counterpart
Mr. Shaman. You need him. Although, all that lazy ass does is sit on the ground
chanting weird things. But, it does keep your life force up. See, he can even
get rid of that epic poison ivy rash you got. Show’em your glaive while you’re
at it. He comes from Marshlands,
so visit if you ever get near. 
Grunt, well no team is complete
without me. Forget Mr. Paladin and others. Watch! Are you impressed? I'm a
shape shifter. See you get the handsome and the furry all in one. Ok, I'll
admit, I may not have the magic power as them but I use swords, axes, and
shit, but I even fight with my
claws. I know awesome, right? Feel free to visit my home in the
pit. Yeah, you  know it baby! I'm from Ground Zero. 
Ewww, reeks of death? That's what
you’re thinking right? Dead on. I'm a Necromancer.
Visit my corpse collection in Haunted Island. One day when these fools die, my
kids will play with their corpses. Yeah, got a death reaper scythe, what you
got?
Boo?  Ahh, poor poor thing, did
I scare you? I'm a ninja. My home lies far away in the Temple Ruins. I
specialize in poofing! Ok, sounds uncool,
but yeah I said it. Need someone
to sneak around, I'm your man. But about the whole fighting thing.. I think
imma stay in the background with my cool throwing stars, daggers, and brass
knuckles. 
Bang, your dead. Sorry buddy, the
shadows are mine. I'm a joker;
if you’re looking for me, DON'T!
But, some of my familiar haunts are in Metropolitan. I specialize in pistols,
cudgels, and knives. I prefer not to be seen at all. If I work with others, I can easily identify and remove
high priority targets. 
Well guys, see this mismatched team?
Choose your favorite and do your thing! Own it and make it yours! Welcome to
Tainted Realm!

Customizations:
Imagine being able to do the normal
game customizations but with great depth. Take 5 people in a row in an MMO and
3 out of the 5 look the same. This INFURIATES
me! Has anyone felt this way? Here at Tainted  that’s what we want!  Complete control of what our characters
look like.  You can make one arm longer than the other, put a third eye in
the middle of your forehead.  Look as real to life or as anime as a
cartoon.  Implants, scars, tattoo’s are just some of the details that you
will be able to use to create your ideal character.  Height, weight, skin
colour, class.  Our default looks will be as varied as we can create, just
so your imagination can take over and make changes that pop into your mind.
 What if you want to be a Archer that looked human or robotic?  You
can, you can look any way you choose.  You don’t have to be bound to one
kind of physical appearance, or one kind of clothing.  Your totally
customizable character can dress in any kind of style you dream of.  You
want to look like a Knight or a cyberpunk dancer?.. go for it.  You want
to look like a goth or emo?... it shall be so.  You like the designs on
that male character’s pants?  Well you can wear them too, no matter if you’re male or female.

Who is S.I.C.: 
Superior Intelligence Corporation is
what S.I.C. stands for.  Imagine FBI, CIA, Army and Government liaisons,
all rolled into one and as evil as can be.  There is no justice under the
watch of the S.I.C.  Their leader is ruthless and cold hearted.  He
will stop at nothing to achieve world domination!

Team:
“Play games with meeeeeee!” This is
a commonly heard phrase during break time from working on Tainted Realm. While
playing, we know how the GMs are
nonexistent in most games or how Customer Service just ignores you. There are
so many limits and so much frustration that these huge gaming companies do not
address. You would hear, “that isn't possible!” “How'd you shoot me through the
wall?” Or.. In my case... “Booooosssssssss!! I fell through the floor again!”
as Samantha facepalms and repeatedly says, “Mark, Mark, Mark”. These are such
small things to fix. We will fix them; mainly because as a gamer it would drive
me crazy. 
For real though, if Samantha sings,
""I like to move it move it” one more time. THE COFFEE WILL BE HIDDEN!
Needless to say, we all have met
each other along our game play and have formed some amazing friendships.
We met some people who have come and
gone but these goofy people have always and will always be here. We love gaming
with and against each other so much that no matter if we win or lose, we never
rage. We have come from all over the world USA, Madagascar, and New Zealand. 
As we sit here and drool from the
hot voice which comes from Andrea’s
mouth, we continue to work on
Tainted Realm and know with our different genre likes and game playing, we will
bring different styles of creativity to Tainted Realm.
Many times when we are finishing up
a meeting you will hear a man’s voice saying “Bye Felicia” with an attitude.
This is the signature of our Nick,
and it wouldn’t be a meeting without hearing that funny send-off.
If you would like to know a little
bit more about this silly but wonderful group, please visits us on our website: www.taintedrealm.com
Risks & Challenges
We are a team of 4 that is putting
together an MMORPG that will costs
thousands of dollars before we can consider the possibilities of releasing an
alpha testing map. We all have our own personal expenses and we are trying to
build this game off of limited funding;
this is why we have come to Indiegogo, where we can go directly to the people
who love to play MMORPGs as much as we do.
Our team is comprised from all
around the world. From the United States greater area all the way to New
Zealand. We are working off of limited technology and experience. With the
funding we receive, we will be
able to hire more experienced personnel as well as upgraded software.

Other Ways You Can help:

We know that not everyone can make a donation, but that doesn't mean you can't help us. We are asking for you
all to make some noise and to share our campaign.
One of the great things you can
utilize here at Indiegogo is their tools to help you share our campaign.


Thank you all for believing in
us.

<p><b>A bit about me and my company Guinevere’s Games</b></p>
<p>Hi everyone! As my title suggests I am back at the fundraising again for two sets of historical playing cards again! This time I want to make the Ambras Court Hunting Deck and the Ambras Court Deck. <u><i>This campaign is to help raise funds for the licensing agreement of both playing cards.</i></u></p>
<p><b><u>****Update****</u> Exciting news! I am working on Downloading the artwork right now!</b></p>
<p><b><u>****Update****</u>  Just waiting on the artwork to send to the printers now.</b></p>
<p><u><b>**Updated** </b></u> <b>The museum has a signed contract by me to produce the playing cards. Now I need your help with the funding for the images I am still short of my goal . </b></p>
<p>This is exciting news for me. But the licensing rights are going to be expensive though around $3.000 Canadian (with exchange rate) to pay for the exclusive rights to legally produce <b>both</b> decks of these playing cards.<br/></p>
<p>Let me tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Jeanette Dunnett and I am a proud owner of a small company that opened their doors to the world in April 2013. I call myself Guinevere’s Games.  I am a company that produces small batches of handcrafted historical board games from many centuries, from the Roman times to the renaissance. I have been working hard to make rule books and game boards for card games; I also make board games, playing cards and dice games. I am a very small company and it is just me doing all the work from marketing to selling, manufacturing and everything in between.</p>
<p><b>My Goal</b></p>
<p>The Ambras Court Deck and the Ambras Hunting Deck, are playing cards that are from the mid 15th century. These playing cards are currently on display at the KHM Museum in Vienna, Austria. I contacted the museum to see if they would be willing to give me rights to produce sets of these playing cards for the history enthusiast or the living history enactor to use at living history events.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>Once again these cards are <b>NOT</b> going to be collector’s cards, they are meant for <b>everyday use</b>. If you want the collector’s editions you can purchase them directly from the KHM website. The collector’s editions are the version that Piatnik made for the KHM Museum.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span><br/></p>
<p>This is where you come in, I am hoping that you can help me come up with a portion of the $3,000 Canadian dollars to help pay for licensing agreement and <u><b>***Updated***</b> now production of the cards.</u></p>
<p><b>The Perks</b></p>
<p>I am  offering some of my company’s products up as perks. Some of the products includes  Twelve Man Morris, (also known as Mills), Corner the Rabbit, and lastly Alquerque board games.  These are leather board games, the Alquerque is made from wood. </p>
<p>The games of Noddy (plays similar to modern day cribbage) and Cribbage (with the original rules from the 1600’s when the game was invented). </p>
<p>The Moorish Playing cards a deck of playing cards from the early 1400’s), and a few of the sets of the Flemish Hunting Deck of playing cards. </p>
<p>As well as printed versions of the Alfonso X Book of Dice games, and some print version of the Book of card games from Francis Willughby. The rules in these books are my version of the rules based on historical manuscripts.</p>

<h3>Ambras Playing Card Specifications</h3>
<p>These are the specs for the playing cards I am producing:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The cards are being printed on modern day 300 gsm coated playing card stock</li>
<li>Full color printed on both sides</li>
<li>Deck size is poker card size (standard playing card size)</li>
<li>Deck will come with a metal storage case</li>
</ul>
<p>I am choosing to use the modern day playing card stock for ease of use, As well as, for durability of the playing cards for everyday use. The poker deck card size is also for ease of use. Playing cards with Tarot sized cards is more difficult due to the size of the card.</p>
<p>The original sizes of these cards are very large, and difficult to hold in the hand. I tested the theory because I own the Piatnik edition of both sets of the Ambras Playing Cards</p>
<p><b><u>****Update****</u></b></p>
<p>The deck for the court hunting deck will contain 56 playing cards. I am modifying two of the playing cards to make the deck usable for playing card games with. The missing two of hounds suit and the 8 of hawks/falcons will be added back into the deck to make this a fully functioning deck<br/><br/></p>

A bit about me and my company Guinevere’s Games
Hi everyone! As my title suggests I am back at the fundraising again for two sets of historical playing cards again! This time I want to make the Ambras Court Hunting Deck and the Ambras Court Deck. This campaign is to help raise funds for the licensing agreement of both playing cards.
****Update**** Exciting news! I am working on Downloading the artwork right now!
****Update****  Just waiting on the artwork to send to the printers now.
**Updated**  The museum has a signed contract by me to produce the playing cards. Now I need your help with the funding for the images I am still short of my goal . 
This is exciting news for me. But the licensing rights are going to be expensive though around $3.000 Canadian (with exchange rate) to pay for the exclusive rights to legally produce both decks of these playing cards.
Let me tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Jeanette Dunnett and I am a proud owner of a small company that opened their doors to the world in April 2013. I call myself Guinevere’s Games.  I am a company that produces small batches of handcrafted historical board games from many centuries, from the Roman times to the renaissance. I have been working hard to make rule books and game boards for card games; I also make board games, playing cards and dice games. I am a very small company and it is just me doing all the work from marketing to selling, manufacturing and everything in between.
My Goal
The Ambras Court Deck and the Ambras Hunting Deck, are playing cards that are from the mid 15th century. These playing cards are currently on display at the KHM Museum in Vienna, Austria. I contacted the museum to see if they would be willing to give me rights to produce sets of these playing cards for the history enthusiast or the living history enactor to use at living history events.
Once again these cards are NOT going to be collector’s cards, they are meant for everyday use. If you want the collector’s editions you can purchase them directly from the KHM website. The collector’s editions are the version that Piatnik made for the KHM Museum.
This is where you come in, I am hoping that you can help me come up with a portion of the $3,000 Canadian dollars to help pay for licensing agreement and ***Updated*** now production of the cards.
The Perks
I am  offering some of my company’s products up as perks. Some of the products includes  Twelve Man Morris, (also known as Mills), Corner the Rabbit, and lastly Alquerque board games.  These are leather board games, the Alquerque is made from wood. 
The games of Noddy (plays similar to modern day cribbage) and Cribbage (with the original rules from the 1600’s when the game was invented). 
The Moorish Playing cards a deck of playing cards from the early 1400’s), and a few of the sets of the Flemish Hunting Deck of playing cards. 
As well as printed versions of the Alfonso X Book of Dice games, and some print version of the Book of card games from Francis Willughby. The rules in these books are my version of the rules based on historical manuscripts.
You can go to my website to get the descriptions of the games offered. Any games awarded through this campaign will be shipped at the end of the campaign. My website is www.guineveresgames.ca.

If you want to get more than one perk there are two ways of claiming the second perk:

decided to finish it but I have some problems with further development of this game because I work on a unsuitable and old computer I also need
some professional softwares for modeling and programing...etc. All stuff that I made until now is made with the free tools and I can't continue

Thank you for stopping by our campaign. We are Team Aiduzzi, a small group of artist and developers. We're working on Rotten Core, an original old-school 2D fighting game that revels in the bizarre and the grotesque. The game has a motley case of characters that are sure to delight anyone who has even a passing interest in the dark and offbeat. The style of Rotten Core blends elements of horror and comedy, and the result is a fighting game that is at once unsettling and funny. The idea of this game has been in progress for a long time. Our team has had the opportunity to collect tons of feedback, which we have incorporated into our plans little by little. Although we have just four characters right now (Ella, Ubu, Giano, and Kuando), we have plans for many more. Our ultimate goal is to publish Rotten Core for PC so it will be available on Steam and if we meet certain stretch goals, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. We would love to have Rotten Core on all of these platforms so that the maximum number of people are able to play and enjoy it.</span><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460700705/bite_off827.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><a name=""wirc"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461522450/image_17_hpzfyv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></span>This
game is in collaboration with Elecbyte, the studio that made the M.U.G.E.N
engine. We're working on a new engine to optimize and run
Rotten Core at its full potential on many more platforms as possible. 
</p>
<p>As stated earlier, Rotten
Core is an old school 2D fighting game. We've been reliving the good
old days to bring you something you could find in a 90's coin op arcade.
But also you'll find modern and sophisticated 2D sprites graphic arts
and animations as well as original gameplay features. 
</p>
<p>We push so much on the
unusual mood of the game, especially our characters. They are not
classic heroes and in fact, they don't want to be heroes. Their skills in
game and their story tell that they are “villains”. Rotten Core has a wicked and
grotesque fashion that makes it different from other fighting games.
You'll never find a “hero who fights for honor”.
There are no “martial arts tournaments”. Here you'll find only
ROTTEN scoundrels, consumed by an inextinguishable destructive madness!</p>

<p>Rotten Core follows the story of Ubu Vagrante, a lonely,
insignificant man who is as unmemorable to others as he is unremarkable to
himself. One night, while walking along a city street, he hears a noise coming
from an alleyway, and despite his usual cowardice, is drawn to the dim corner
where he finds a box nestled between two corpses. When he opens it, inside he
finds a strange organ that is anything but human, and is overcome by an impulse
to eat it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459361773/hpsx2yt9tzak6lkdbvss.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After he consumes the organ, called loboeucarixtus, it transforms him from a weak individual into a virile, amoral, violent, hedonistic, all-powerful being. Going forward, Ubu will fight anyone simply for the sake of fighting.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> For each character in the game, it is the consumption of the loboeucarixtus
that gives them the power and personality that it takes to make them worthy of
battle.</span></p>

<p><b>Ubu</b> is an arsonist obsessed with blowing things up. His style is sloppy and he is prone to losing his train of thought, sometimes even falling asleep while he is standing. However he is still a versatile fighter. He uses his hands as guns and that’s quite literal, as he can hit opponents either from close range with high explosive punches, or from long range with powerful cannon shots and bursts of “machine gun fire”.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Ella’s</b> mysterious origins are known only to Ubu. Her power is held inside the disturbing objects that she carries, most notably, her slimy, talking teddy bear known as ‘Trauma’. Her fighting style is unpredictable, as these objects will burst forth from where they are hidden inside her body. Most notable of these hidden objects is Trauma himself, who is also heavily armed.  </p>

<p><b>Giano</b> is Ubu’s brother. Tortured by bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, he is prone to violent and unprovoked attacks, and is believed to be haunted by more than one-hundred entities. He looks old, but his punches are heavy. Giano's gameplay is focused on combos, and his moves involve launchers that devastate opponents, especially from close range.<br/></p>

His unorthodox style uses 3 different stances to cover short, middle and long distances, and he is both versatile and deadly.<br/></p>

<b>Enda Ashisa</b> is a ninja, and Persian mercenary bomber. She has not eaten the loboeucarixtus, but rather, has been hired to retrieve it.

<b>Zatto</b> is another mercenary hired by the Yakuza to retrieve the loboeucarixtus, and therefore he has not eaten it either. He's called (and feared as) “The Human Rock”. If you don't fear his slowness, you'll get a character with a lot of powerful stun attacks that can easily destroy his opponent.

<p><b>1. Distinctive Moves</b></p>
<p>Pressing a specified button allows each character to perform his own peculiar moves. Every character has his own distinctive move which can be an evasive one, an attacking one or maybe a move useful for a combo startup... or maybe something else!</p>
<p><b>2. Enhanced Special Moves (ESM)</b><br/></p>
<p>Some special moves can be enhanced with a little amount of the power meter bar</p>
<p><b>3. Rotten Arts (RA)</b><br/></p>
<p>Each character has some powerful Super Moves called Rotten Arts. They can be performed at the cost of one power meter bar segment. </p>
<p><b>4. Uber Rotten Arts (URA)</b><br/></p>
<p>Each character has some very devastating Super Moves called Uber Rotten Arts. They can be performed at the cost of two power meter bar segments. </p>
<p><b>5. Cross Impact (CI), Perfect Cross Impact (PCI) and Cross Charge Reaction (CCR) </b> (Check out the trailer above for an example)</p>
<p>Cross Impact (CI) and Perfect Cross Impact (PCI) System is a new kind of mechanics in a Beat’em’up.  When you are in a difficult situation, you can now try to defend with an attack! Some attacks have auto guard impact properties which can transform a defense into a lethal opening window for an attack. Maybe a devastating combo! But don’t think that it will be easy! Your opponent can react with a Cross Charge Reaction (CCR). Every CCR brings each character to an unique spectacular scene where two fighters challenge each other (every character has a different reaction with each opponent that he(or she) fights!) with the result of charging their power meters. So CI, PCI and CCR are a technical and spectacular new system to attack an opponent and also defend yourself from him!</p>
<p><b>6- Madness Power Bar  </b>(added for Rotten Core: Purple Pain Edition)<br/></p>
<p>Each character has an extra own power meter used for new powerful special ESM. </p>
<p><b>7- End of the World (EOTW) </b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">(added for Rotten Core: Purple Pain Edition) </span></p>

<p><b>Embargo </b>is the only character to retain his original features after eating the loboeucarixtus. Known as “The Cursed,” he is haunted by a pink unicorn. He can throw devastating black flames that consume anything in their path, however, the unicorn often tries to assist him by replacing his deadly attacks with colorful rainbows and lovely little stars. </p>

<p><b>The Man with The Hammer</b> is a white-collar worker who, unbeknownst to himself, works as a hitman while he is unconscious. Wrongly believing himself to be unlucky, he is a master with his talking hammer and leads an otherwise quiet life. Initially appearing to be weak and defenseless, his hammer can change his personality, making him a very disturbing and dangerous fighter. <br/></p>

<p><b>Fortuna</b> is a self destructive girl who has nearly reached immortality. An autophagist, bulimic, and a cannibal, she enjoys suffering and fights mostly with cutlery that can be controlled as she wishes, to set up many traps.

Closing Message
F.A.Q.
Hello! Thank you for stopping by our campaign. We are Team Aiduzzi, a small group of artist and developers. We're working on Rotten Core, an original old-school 2D fighting game that revels in the bizarre and the grotesque. The game has a motley case of characters that are sure to delight anyone who has even a passing interest in the dark and offbeat. The style of Rotten Core blends elements of horror and comedy, and the result is a fighting game that is at once unsettling and funny. The idea of this game has been in progress for a long time. Our team has had the opportunity to collect tons of feedback, which we have incorporated into our plans little by little. Although we have just four characters right now (Ella, Ubu, Giano, and Kuando), we have plans for many more. Our ultimate goal is to publish Rotten Core for PC so it will be available on Steam and if we meet certain stretch goals, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. We would love to have Rotten Core on all of these platforms so that the maximum number of people are able to play and enjoy it.
This
game is in collaboration with Elecbyte, the studio that made the M.U.G.E.N
engine. We're working on a new engine to optimize and run
Rotten Core at its full potential on many more platforms as possible. 

As stated earlier, Rotten
Core is an old school 2D fighting game. We've been reliving the good
old days to bring you something you could find in a 90's coin op arcade.
But also you'll find modern and sophisticated 2D sprites graphic arts
and animations as well as original gameplay features. 

We push so much on the
unusual mood of the game, especially our characters. They are not
classic heroes and in fact, they don't want to be heroes. Their skills in
game and their story tell that they are “villains”. Rotten Core has a wicked and
grotesque fashion that makes it different from other fighting games.
You'll never find a “hero who fights for honor”.
There are no “martial arts tournaments”. Here you'll find only
ROTTEN scoundrels, consumed by an inextinguishable destructive madness!






We have created four completely unique characters during the very little off time we could find in between our work and home life. By helping us reach our funding goal we can spend a full time commitment to Rotten Core’s development and also bring in other talented artist and programmers into our development circle. Our funding model is all or nothing otherwise known as fixed funding. We believe this is the best type of funding for our project since if we do not meet our goal, all of the funds will go back to their respective backers. We were able to bring you four unique characters in the little allotted time that we had over the past several years. Just imagine how awesome we can make the new characters if we can devote full time! With your donations we can bring an amazing addition to the fighting game world.






Rotten Core follows the story of Ubu Vagrante, a lonely,
insignificant man who is as unmemorable to others as he is unremarkable to
himself. One night, while walking along a city street, he hears a noise coming
from an alleyway, and despite his usual cowardice, is drawn to the dim corner
where he finds a box nestled between two corpses. When he opens it, inside he
finds a strange organ that is anything but human, and is overcome by an impulse
to eat it.

After he consumes the organ, called loboeucarixtus, it transforms him from a weak individual into a virile, amoral, violent, hedonistic, all-powerful being. Going forward, Ubu will fight anyone simply for the sake of fighting. For each character in the game, it is the consumption of the loboeucarixtus
that gives them the power and personality that it takes to make them worthy of
battle.

CHARACTERS


Ubu is an arsonist obsessed with blowing things up. His style is sloppy and he is prone to losing his train of thought, sometimes even falling asleep while he is standing. However he is still a versatile fighter. He uses his hands as guns and that’s quite literal, as he can hit opponents either from close range with high explosive punches, or from long range with powerful cannon shots and bursts of “machine gun fire”.


Ella’s mysterious origins are known only to Ubu. Her power is held inside the disturbing objects that she carries, most notably, her slimy, talking teddy bear known as ‘Trauma’. Her fighting style is unpredictable, as these objects will burst forth from where they are hidden inside her body. Most notable of these hidden objects is Trauma himself, who is also heavily armed.  



Giano is Ubu’s brother. Tortured by bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, he is prone to violent and unprovoked attacks, and is believed to be haunted by more than one-hundred entities. He looks old, but his punches are heavy. Giano's gameplay is focused on combos, and his moves involve launchers that devastate opponents, especially from close range.



Kuando is a dirty street boxer with no empathy, who loves to make anyone he can suffer as much as possible. Though he is constantly dressed in a motorcycle outfit, as far as anyone can tell, he does not own a motorcycle. His unorthodox style uses 3 different stances to cover short, middle and long distances, and he is both versatile and deadly.



In addition to our original four characters, Ubu, Kuando, Giano and Ella, funding will be used to add the following rotten bunch to the game.



Perro is one of Ubu’s bodyguards. With an unrequited crush
on the mysterious Ella, this wrestler on a constant masochistic bent,
seeks out pain in his underwear and suspenders while dishing out a flurry of sadomasochistic throws. 


LSD is a psychiatrist based out of the Asylum where Giano was formerly committed. Though bound by a straitjacket, his feet are a deadly force, and he counterbalances this situation by using his flexible and highly evasive body along with lethal kicks and sharpened teeth.


Enda Ashisa is a ninja, and Persian mercenary bomber. She has not eaten the loboeucarixtus, but rather, has been hired to retrieve it. Filled with self-loathing, she is an expert fighter with a gift for speed, who uses a plethora of traps and explosives to confuse her opponent. 



Zatto is another mercenary hired by the Yakuza to retrieve the loboeucarixtus, and therefore he has not eaten it either. He's called (and feared as) “The Human Rock”. If you don't fear his slowness, you'll get a character with a lot of powerful stun attacks that can easily destroy his opponent. 






Rotten Core has many well designed features and graphics that give the game a unique and colorful overall look, whilst still paying homage to the design of classic fighting games.
1. Sprites with beautiful pixel art 


*Handmade dynamic lights on characters bodies, Some special moves have that dynamic lights effect
                             
2. Animated stages drawn in Full HD Resolution that move and breathe during gameplay. 







3. All New HD Explosions 

4. Engaging Story Mode - Follow the story of your character
5. Arcade Mode - Play rounds upon rounds of tournament style fights.
6. Training Mode -  Learn the ins and outs of favorite characters and their moves.
7. Tag Mode - Pick a partner and tag them at will during a match
9. Easy to Navigate Menus








1. Distinctive Moves
Pressing a specified button allows each character to perform his own peculiar moves. Every character has his own distinctive move which can be an evasive one, an attacking one or maybe a move useful for a combo startup... or maybe something else!
2. Enhanced Special Moves (ESM)
Some special moves can be enhanced with a little amount of the power meter bar
3. Rotten Arts (RA)
Each character has some powerful Super Moves called Rotten Arts. They can be performed at the cost of one power meter bar segment. 
4. Uber Rotten Arts (URA)
Each character has some very devastating Super Moves called Uber Rotten Arts. They can be performed at the cost of two power meter bar segments. 
5. Cross Impact (CI), Perfect Cross Impact (PCI) and Cross Charge Reaction (CCR)  (Check out the trailer above for an example)
Cross Impact (CI) and Perfect Cross Impact (PCI) System is a new kind of mechanics in a Beat’em’up.  When you are in a difficult situation, you can now try to defend with an attack! Some attacks have auto guard impact properties which can transform a defense into a lethal opening window for an attack. Maybe a devastating combo! But don’t think that it will be easy! Your opponent can react with a Cross Charge Reaction (CCR). Every CCR brings each character to an unique spectacular scene where two fighters challenge each other (every character has a different reaction with each opponent that he(or she) fights!) with the result of charging their power meters. So CI, PCI and CCR are a technical and spectacular new system to attack an opponent and also defend yourself from him!
6- Madness Power Bar  (added for Rotten Core: Purple Pain Edition)
Each character has an extra own power meter used for new powerful special ESM. 
7- End of the World (EOTW) (added for Rotten Core: Purple Pain Edition) 
Each character can cause the end of the world with an ultra devastating final blow which instantly kill the opponent.





Team Aiduzzi has hand drawn and coded Ella, Ubu, Giano, and Kuando on our own. As stated previously, with your donations we will bring in additional coders and ""spriters"" to assist us full time. If we reach our funding goal of $87,000 the following features will be added to the complete game at their respective costs.

$127,000 development of another character!

$151,000 development of another character!
$169,000 GGPO  - GGPO middle-ware helps minimize any issues with lag when players fight each other online. 
STRETCH GOAL CHARACTERS
In addition to the previously mentioned Rotten lineup, we have four more characters that can come to life with your help!
Imperia is a young mistress who prior to eating the organ was a washed-up stripper, and even now has a love for Perro that is un-reciprocated. She is a killer both on and off the pole, and an acrobatic wrestler who can summon her personal tool of the trade to do some lethal attacks. 





Embargo is the only character to retain his original features after eating the loboeucarixtus. Known as “The Cursed,” he is haunted by a pink unicorn. He can throw devastating black flames that consume anything in their path, however, the unicorn often tries to assist him by replacing his deadly attacks with colorful rainbows and lovely little stars. 

The Man with The Hammer is a white-collar worker who, unbeknownst to himself, works as a hitman while he is unconscious. Wrongly believing himself to be unlucky, he is a master with his talking hammer and leads an otherwise quiet life. Initially appearing to be weak and defenseless, his hammer can change his personality, making him a very disturbing and dangerous fighter. 



Fortuna is a self destructive girl who has nearly reached immortality. An autophagist, bulimic, and a cannibal, she enjoys suffering and fights mostly with cutlery that can be controlled as she wishes, to set up many traps. She enjoys launching herself at her opponent and summoning her cutlery to do damage both to her opponent and herself. These skills make her a perfect zone fighter.


And at $174,000 we will be bringing to you Rotten Core Purple Pain: A new addition to the Rotten Core story that focuses on the feared Embargo! An enhanced version of Rotten Core with a new and more intense part of the story, all 12 characters and new NPCs, new gameplay features (Madness power bar,  End of the world), better animations and handmade lights effects.

We estimate about one year of work to reach the final form of Rotten Core. Estimated release is July/August 2017

2. Is Rotten Core graphics HD?
Rotten Core combines low res pixel art characters with HD stages and HD explosions. All menus, game intro and comic strips (in the story mode) are HD.

3. All characters, voices, stages and visual effects (explosions) will be original?
Yes. We want to draw these ones from scratch. All characters are original (we want to fix Ubu and make him original), all voices are original, all stages too. We want to draw new original explosions and replace them or some other, new ones.

4. Characters are ripped from other games?
No, all characters will be original

5. M.U.G.E.N is a freeware engine?
Yes. We are making this game in a collaboration with Elecbyte. We purchased a licensed version of M.U.G.E.N. for commercial use. 

6. Who is Aiduzzi?
Aiduzzi throughout the M.U.G.E.N. community is a well-know characters and stages creator. Now he's rising up a team to develop Rotten Core. It's Team Aiduzzi.

7. Why aren't you offering a box version of the game?
We would love to offer a version of the game in box form but  producing a physical box, printing a game manual and burning CDs is too much expensive for a small indipendent software house as actually Team Aiduzzi is. We are very sorry.

8. Why is the PS4/Xbox One version of the game a stretch goal?
As stated previously, we would love to offer a console version of the game. Actually making a console version of Rotten Core is very expensive, so we are forced to put PS4/XBOX ONE version of Rotten Core as stretch goals

9. Does Rotten Core run at 30 or 60fps?
60fps.

10. What are the system requirements for Rotten Core?
We don't yet know the exact numbers, but we can assure that this game will run at 60fps fairly low minimum spec. We'll give you specifics as soon as we know ourselves.

11. How do you know which  T-shirt I want (Physical Bits for Your Mitts perk)?
Once the campaign has ended we'll be sending out surveys to find out which T-shirt you'd like. 

12. How do you know which  unique handmade sketch of Aiduzzi I want (Rotten Scoundrel perk)?
Once the campaign has ended we'll be sending out surveys to find out which sketch you'd like. Keep in mind that they are unique pieces, so each chosed sketch by someone else is gone forever.  Orders shall be settled in chronological order, so if you are interested in this perk, try to donate as soon as possible to have a wider choice.",56.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1><b>About the project</b></h1>
<p>Because we always loved stories about ancient kingdoms, kings, dragons, miths and creatures from fairytails we got an idea to make a game based on one of the stories like that. Our hero is dwarf. We have to say  we were inspired by movies like Lord of the Rings but this time unlike that movie where  dwarfs are playing supporting roles, this time in our game dwarf is main actor. We are working on this project for about half year. In section ""What have we done so far?"" you can find out more about this project. Click on Gallery to see more images! We are working on video presentation. Stay tuned!</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><b>My name is Alejandro, and together with
my friend Sergio, we are here to change the way we meet people, and ultimately
how social networks work.</b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><b>We want to create a new and
groundbreaking trend that gives users a breath of fresh air, offering a new,
original and funny way to meet people while playing and getting rewards. That
is Betlyn,…, the new app for the new age.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Breaking with the current
monotonous and boring apps that you can find in the market place today, Betlyn
gives users a well needed change:</b></b></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Meet new people in a new, original, and fun way</b></li>
<li><b>Get free amazing rewards while playing and getting to know each other</b></li>
<li><b>Designed for all!, it fits young, mature, gay, swingers</b></li>
</ol>
<p>The process is simple and fun:</p>
<p>PLAY + BET + LIE &amp; WIN = BETLYN</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The
funding obtained is essential for the development and implementation of this
innovative application, designed equally for youngsters and adults. </p>
<h3>WHAT IS BETLYN</h3>
<div>
<p>Betlyn
is a new game that will let you win amazing prizes and meet new people. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Taking advantage of the great impact that social networks have on our lives today</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">; <i><b>Our purpose aims </b></i></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i><b>to promote social interaction between people in an effective and simple way.</b></i></span></p>
<p>Entering
into the Betlyn community is simple: Create your profile, set your privacy settings (choosing which ones you wanna make private or public),
and … welcome to the community! </p>
<p>Now it is the
time to bet the game and become insane!  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Look
for people you want to challange,  make a bet &amp; send the request. There are 3 levels of bets:</p>
<ol style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<li>LITTLE
     PUPPY: where you will find innocent and productive actions to test your
     opponent. You could bet things like your phone number, your email address,
     your facebook link, activate the chat,  write a poem, sing a song,
     unblock some photos of your opponent’s profile, …</li>
<li>NAUGHTY
     PUPPY:  here things become more interesting, the bets are more spicy and
     of a small economic value. Only for the most daring and brave people
     who wanna risk a little more. You could bet things like one kiss in the
     lips, pay for a cinema date, buy flowers to your opponent or send a sexy
     photo. </li>
<li>EVIL
     PUPPY: That’s the most interesting bet of this social network. This Game
     is only for couples, lovers or for people who have great trust between
     them. The bets here become absolutely shameless and crazy. Better if you
     discover the Evil Puppy by yourselve :)</li>

<p>Once you've decided the level of the bet,
it is time to choose (amongst a given list of options) what do you want to bet
and send the request to your oponent to let him/her know what’s at stake!, but
be aware, if your opponent accepts the challenge, you will have no choice but
to accept his/her bet (within the same level of bet). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that everyone has posted a bet, let
the game begin! Your opponent will write 4 things about her/his life, 3 being
true and 1 being a big lie, and you will have to guess which one is the lie!</p>
<p>The winner will get his/her bet and will
earn “Puppus”. “Puppus” is Betlyn’s currency for use only in Betlyn’s website
where you can exchange them for wonderful prizes such as cinema tickets, special
activities, romantic dinners and even airplane tickets and weekend stays in spa hotels. These
prizes are meant to be enjoyed with your partner, lover, or friends. So, the
more you play the more “Puppus” you will earn!, and with more “Puppus” more
interesting awards. </p>
<p>The amount of “Puppus” earned depends on
the level of the bet:</p>
<ul>
<li>LITTLE PUPPY = 5 PUPPUS</li>
<li>NAUGHTY PUPPY = 10 PUPPUS</li>

</div></div>","INTRODUCTION 


My name is Alejandro, and together with
my friend Sergio, we are here to change the way we meet people, and ultimately
how social networks work.

We want to create a new and
groundbreaking trend that gives users a breath of fresh air, offering a new,
original and funny way to meet people while playing and getting rewards. That
is Betlyn,…, the new app for the new age.
Breaking with the current
monotonous and boring apps that you can find in the market place today, Betlyn
gives users a well needed change:

Meet new people in a new, original, and fun way
Get free amazing rewards while playing and getting to know each other
Designed for all!, it fits young, mature, gay, swingers

The process is simple and fun:
PLAY + BET + LIE & WIN = BETLYN


The
funding obtained is essential for the development and implementation of this
innovative application, designed equally for youngsters and adults. 
WHAT IS BETLYN

Betlyn
is a new game that will let you win amazing prizes and meet new people. 
Taking advantage of the great impact that social networks have on our lives today; Our purpose aims to promote social interaction between people in an effective and simple way.
Entering
into the Betlyn community is simple: Create your profile, set your privacy settings (choosing which ones you wanna make private or public),
and … welcome to the community! 
Now it is the
time to bet the game and become insane!   

Look
for people you want to challange,  make a bet & send the request. There are 3 levels of bets:

LITTLE
     PUPPY: where you will find innocent and productive actions to test your
     opponent. You could bet things like your phone number, your email address,
     your facebook link, activate the chat,  write a poem, sing a song,
     unblock some photos of your opponent’s profile, …
NAUGHTY
     PUPPY:  here things become more interesting, the bets are more spicy and
     of a small economic value. Only for the most daring and brave people
     who wanna risk a little more. You could bet things like one kiss in the
     lips, pay for a cinema date, buy flowers to your opponent or send a sexy
     photo. 
EVIL
     PUPPY: That’s the most interesting bet of this social network. This Game
     is only for couples, lovers or for people who have great trust between
     them. The bets here become absolutely shameless and crazy. Better if you
     discover the Evil Puppy by yourselve :)






Once you've decided the level of the bet,
it is time to choose (amongst a given list of options) what do you want to bet
and send the request to your oponent to let him/her know what’s at stake!, but
be aware, if your opponent accepts the challenge, you will have no choice but
to accept his/her bet (within the same level of bet). 

Now that everyone has posted a bet, let
the game begin! Your opponent will write 4 things about her/his life, 3 being
true and 1 being a big lie, and you will have to guess which one is the lie!
The winner will get his/her bet and will
earn “Puppus”. “Puppus” is Betlyn’s currency for use only in Betlyn’s website
where you can exchange them for wonderful prizes such as cinema tickets, special
activities, romantic dinners and even airplane tickets and weekend stays in spa hotels. These
prizes are meant to be enjoyed with your partner, lover, or friends. So, the
more you play the more “Puppus” you will earn!, and with more “Puppus” more
interesting awards. 
The amount of “Puppus” earned depends on
the level of the bet:

LITTLE PUPPY = 5 PUPPUS
NAUGHTY PUPPY = 10 PUPPUS
EVIL PUPPY = 20 PUPPUS








The equation is simple:
+ PEOPLE = +PUPPUS >>>>> + PUPPUS = + AWARDS
The awards are completely free and can be redeemed on the website of BETLYN.COM
FYI: All the prizes you can get are
activities that you can enjoy with people (friends, couple, lovers...). Betlyn team is
aware of the problem that exists today with the ‘mobile-addiction-mania'
and we would like to encourage social activities among people, forgetting
some of the virtual world in which we live in.

<h3>Why JACK KUDOS?</h3>
<p>We live in a world where it may be easy to lose hope. Just listen to the cries of abandoned, neglected children. Look into the eyes of the elderly seeking to find ""home."" Smell the skin of the homeless wearing their pride with two extended hands.  Feel the twirl of the earth when you discovered a betrayal by your beloved, when your hard work was coldly unrecognized or even simply when you lost your keys. With JACK KUDOS, we thrive to make a little difference in your life - by making you smile, giving you hope, letting you know that you are destined for glory.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442518598/a7zkbo2wyau6nwnhgjhx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><span style=""font-size: 10px;font-weight: 500;"">Games and challenges make people smile.</span></p>
<p>JACK KUDOS lets you grab KUDOS jumping from platform to platform.  Think of the KUDOS as little victories in your life - the little star sticker that your 5th grade teacher gave you for knowing all the countries in the world, your first car and all the loving memories it carried, the man (or the woman) who caused rapid heartbeats, the inability to concentrate and extreme sophistication over choice of apparel. :) We are meant for glory.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;font-weight: 500;"">Our interns Owen and Maher had fun creating this campaign video. </span></p>
<p>Games are meant to give you FUN. Combined with the message that you are indeed awesome and the mission to grab KUDOS to earn the highest points, we hope that you are not lost in escapism (in a virtual reality that is far from home) but instead we hope that you are subconsciously - with all of your being (belief, thought, emotion and action) - making ""home"" within. We want you to believe that you are meant for glory. We want you to think that there is hope. We want you to have fun. We want you to grab that KUDOS.</p>
<p>And with JACK KUDOS, we want to make that difference.</p>

</div><div> <h3>The Story Behind JACK KUDOS</h3>
<p>It was an ordinary day in 2013. Michelle had made a choice to build a company, something that people would love, from scratch and with a few values. Leaving the past behind her, she started with a brick of faith.</p>
<p>Michelle wanted a logo and mascot that would represent the values of this new company including the values of playfulness and fun. Jack is thus born. As you know, hippopotamus means ""Water Horse"" and it is symbolic of emotional depth, protection of family, creation, imagination and birth of new ideas - a perfect logo and mascot for BondsWell since bondswell.com is a platform that allows you to create, contextualize and publish your expression (or ""bond""). You earn kudos when someone gives your bond a strawberry.</p>
<p><a href=""https://earlyaccess.bondswell.com/bond/54dbdf0c9cf7f2874e000005"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442885654/nyk8ptcuqs86y48cpmww.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a><br/><span style=""font-size: 10px;font-weight: 500;"">When you like a bond, you give your friend a Kudo! Click the image to see it on bondswell.com!</span></p>
<p>Since strawberries represent KUDOS, JACK KUDOS is thus an extension of the company in a way that combines fun, resilience and glory in a game. JACK KUDOS takes place in the heart of South Africa when Jack is enjoying his basket of fruits when a devilish blue rhino beetle flies in and deprives him of his pleasure. Instead of accepting his fate, Jack jumps from platform to platform grabbing bananas, apples and KUDOS.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtKqIo4NPTQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><br/><span style=""font-size: 10px;font-weight: 500;"">The animated magical story behind the game. </span></p>
<p>In a deeper sense, JACK KUDOS could be Michelle or any one of us. You are JACK KUDOS because you faced adversity in some way, learned valuable lessons from them, accepted yourself for who you are and then proceeded to grab KUDOS, consciously creating a harmonious life.</p>
</div><div> <h3>How is JACK KUDOS different?</h3>
<p>Instead of creating a random game just for the sake of creating a game, JACK KUDOS is different because it focuses on the game play of grabbing KUDOS.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442518615/xo3klnk10yzevsxaxkox.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><span style=""font-size: 10px;font-weight: 500;"">Each player may face challenges, learn lessons and achieve glories.</span></p>
<p>JACK KUDOS focuses on the authenticity of the player, circumstances and the world rather than on victimization or escapism of gaming. By playing the game, you learn to be empowered to adjust your thoughts and circumstances in your physical reality while having fun at the same time.</p>
<p>JACK KUDOS subconsciously shows you that you want to earn KUDOS by taking action, by jumping from platform to platform to grab KUDOS. You are no longer a victim just because a rhino beetle takes a basket of fruit from you. You learn that you have all the power within yourself to change your reality, that you are indeed destined for glory.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442518299/t71kh7vp0caijdosyfn3.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><span style=""font-size: 10px;font-weight: 500;"">You have the power to change your life!</span></p>

<p>Our Team is comprised of some awesome minds from different ages, backgrounds and stories. Below is a little background story on our leaders.</p> <h4>Michelle | Developer</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473729813/kwlxw7bgoizsoeveve9o.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Michelle begins drawing when she was a child. She loves using pencil, acrylic, oil, watercolor and tools such as airbrushes, cameras and video cameras. During lunch time in high school, she would lug a watercolor brush from right to the left of the canvas, noticing how it fades in accordance with distance, time and pressure. She would draw a model with a pencil, ensuring that her pupils pop and her upper lips shaded.  She would create comics on the Apple Classic computer, print them and share them with friends. She would own one of the first digital cameras and capture professional photographs of their emotions, style and weddings. She would make video clips during her travels and later could not believe that she could share them on Vine.</p>
<p>Michelle loves technology and now, she is truly grateful to be at the intersection of technology and creativity as well as humanity (as she is involved in a number of non-profit organizations in high school and beyond).</p>
<p>Her favorite games are Contra, Tetris, Duck Hunt, Time Crisis, Paper Toss, Fruit Ninja, Words With Friends, Chess With Friends, Draw With Friends and Daytona USA.</p> <h4>Lou Stone | Design</h4>

<p>Lou is a design-animal, crazy dog mom and avid gamer. Favorite games include: Skyrim (Xbox), Fallout Shelter (iOS) and The Sims 3 (PC). She also loves camping with her family, hiking with her friends and watching movies with her hubby.</p>
<p>Lou's love for art and design started early. Drawing, painting or anything involving glue and materials was a main-stay of childhood—and encouraged by her wonderful grandmother, Susan Stone, who is also a talented artist.</p>
<p>Unsure of the path to be taken after high school, Lou spent 4 years at a community college trying to figure it out. Leaving with 2 degrees, one in Graphic Design and one in General Studies (both with honors), she set her sights on San Jose State University.</p>
<p>At SJSU, she worked very hard to qualify for the BFA program in Graphic Design. Lou received the Fang Quai New Media Achievement Award for a 3 part video series in 2011. In 2013 she graduated early from the Fine Arts program with honors and moved to Washington state with her husband.</p>

<p>A portion of the funds will go into developers and animators to work over the course of the year to complete the game. In the future we will add sound effects and music. To say the least, we are more than excited to make this happen!</p>
<p>Telling the world about JACK KUDOS is as important as developing and publishing it, and therefore, a portion of the funds will go into marketing.</p>
<p>We are just like any other community crowdfunding a campaign. It is up to you, the community, if JACK KUDOS will live or die. So let's band together and make this prevail!</p> <h4>Game Art</h4>

<p>The objective of the game is to grab as many strawberries (Kudos) as possible. Each strawberry is worth 25 points. You will earn 1 Kudo for each strawberry. The banana is worth 5 points and apple is worth 15 points. Jack only has three (3) lives so make it count!</p> <h4>Gameplay Preview</h4>

<p>Delays: There is a chance that JACK KUDOS may not come out until after Summer 2016. Our team may from time to time focus upon aspects of JACK KUDOS outside of making the game that still requires quality time (such as running this campaign, fulfilling rewards and further fundraising).</p>
<p>This campaign, however, will finance developers and marketers who will speed up the game making process and make JACK KUDOS absolutely awesome. Your contributions are the key to making JACK KUDOS on the iOS platform.</p>

About JACK KUDOS
JACK KUDOS is a mobile game featuring Jack (a hippo from South Africa and our logo and mascot) and his mission possible choices to grab kudos, represented by each piece of strawberry in the game (now thereafter, ""KUDOS"").
Kudos are within reach, and it is possible to have fun at the same time.
JACK KUDOS lives to tell this message:  Whether you're the child with his mother selling crafted jewelry in front of the fine sandy beaches of the majestic Yasawa Islands in Fiji; the entrepreneurial woman hustling to sell Banh Mi to tourists and businesses on their way to Ha Long Bay from the port of Haiphong in Vietnam; or the full time game tester building the latest mod in the heart of Silicon Valley with fully loaded headsets and mouse —You are destined for glory.
Ha Long Bay, Vietnam. Even though it was once bombed with Agent Orange during the war, it is still a place of beauty.

This is a partnership for anyone interested in cross-promotion activities. We're all about community. Partner with us to help get the word out about our campaign and we'll help share your content across our extensive distribution channels.

 
Why JACK KUDOS?
We live in a world where it may be easy to lose hope. Just listen to the cries of abandoned, neglected children. Look into the eyes of the elderly seeking to find ""home."" Smell the skin of the homeless wearing their pride with two extended hands.  Feel the twirl of the earth when you discovered a betrayal by your beloved, when your hard work was coldly unrecognized or even simply when you lost your keys. With JACK KUDOS, we thrive to make a little difference in your life - by making you smile, giving you hope, letting you know that you are destined for glory.
Games and challenges make people smile.
JACK KUDOS lets you grab KUDOS jumping from platform to platform.  Think of the KUDOS as little victories in your life - the little star sticker that your 5th grade teacher gave you for knowing all the countries in the world, your first car and all the loving memories it carried, the man (or the woman) who caused rapid heartbeats, the inability to concentrate and extreme sophistication over choice of apparel. :) We are meant for glory.

Our interns Owen and Maher had fun creating this campaign video. 
Games are meant to give you FUN. Combined with the message that you are indeed awesome and the mission to grab KUDOS to earn the highest points, we hope that you are not lost in escapism (in a virtual reality that is far from home) but instead we hope that you are subconsciously - with all of your being (belief, thought, emotion and action) - making ""home"" within. We want you to believe that you are meant for glory. We want you to think that there is hope. We want you to have fun. We want you to grab that KUDOS.
And with JACK KUDOS, we want to make that difference.

Laugh some more with Maher!
 The Story Behind JACK KUDOS
It was an ordinary day in 2013. Michelle had made a choice to build a company, something that people would love, from scratch and with a few values. Leaving the past behind her, she started with a brick of faith.
Michelle wanted a logo and mascot that would represent the values of this new company including the values of playfulness and fun. Jack is thus born. As you know, hippopotamus means ""Water Horse"" and it is symbolic of emotional depth, protection of family, creation, imagination and birth of new ideas - a perfect logo and mascot for BondsWell since bondswell.com is a platform that allows you to create, contextualize and publish your expression (or ""bond""). You earn kudos when someone gives your bond a strawberry.
When you like a bond, you give your friend a Kudo! Click the image to see it on bondswell.com!
Since strawberries represent KUDOS, JACK KUDOS is thus an extension of the company in a way that combines fun, resilience and glory in a game. JACK KUDOS takes place in the heart of South Africa when Jack is enjoying his basket of fruits when a devilish blue rhino beetle flies in and deprives him of his pleasure. Instead of accepting his fate, Jack jumps from platform to platform grabbing bananas, apples and KUDOS.

The animated magical story behind the game. 
In a deeper sense, JACK KUDOS could be Michelle or any one of us. You are JACK KUDOS because you faced adversity in some way, learned valuable lessons from them, accepted yourself for who you are and then proceeded to grab KUDOS, consciously creating a harmonious life.
 How is JACK KUDOS different?
Instead of creating a random game just for the sake of creating a game, JACK KUDOS is different because it focuses on the game play of grabbing KUDOS.
Each player may face challenges, learn lessons and achieve glories.
JACK KUDOS focuses on the authenticity of the player, circumstances and the world rather than on victimization or escapism of gaming. By playing the game, you learn to be empowered to adjust your thoughts and circumstances in your physical reality while having fun at the same time.
JACK KUDOS subconsciously shows you that you want to earn KUDOS by taking action, by jumping from platform to platform to grab KUDOS. You are no longer a victim just because a rhino beetle takes a basket of fruit from you. You learn that you have all the power within yourself to change your reality, that you are indeed destined for glory.
You have the power to change your life!

 JACK KUDOS Team

Our Team is comprised of some awesome minds from different ages, backgrounds and stories. Below is a little background story on our leaders. Michelle | Developer

Michelle begins drawing when she was a child. She loves using pencil, acrylic, oil, watercolor and tools such as airbrushes, cameras and video cameras. During lunch time in high school, she would lug a watercolor brush from right to the left of the canvas, noticing how it fades in accordance with distance, time and pressure. She would draw a model with a pencil, ensuring that her pupils pop and her upper lips shaded.  She would create comics on the Apple Classic computer, print them and share them with friends. She would own one of the first digital cameras and capture professional photographs of their emotions, style and weddings. She would make video clips during her travels and later could not believe that she could share them on Vine.
Michelle loves technology and now, she is truly grateful to be at the intersection of technology and creativity as well as humanity (as she is involved in a number of non-profit organizations in high school and beyond).
Her favorite games are Contra, Tetris, Duck Hunt, Time Crisis, Paper Toss, Fruit Ninja, Words With Friends, Chess With Friends, Draw With Friends and Daytona USA. Lou Stone | Design
Visiting McMenamins Grand Lodge, Oregon
Lou is a design-animal, crazy dog mom and avid gamer. Favorite games include: Skyrim (Xbox), Fallout Shelter (iOS) and The Sims 3 (PC). She also loves camping with her family, hiking with her friends and watching movies with her hubby.
Lou's love for art and design started early. Drawing, painting or anything involving glue and materials was a main-stay of childhood—and encouraged by her wonderful grandmother, Susan Stone, who is also a talented artist.
Unsure of the path to be taken after high school, Lou spent 4 years at a community college trying to figure it out. Leaving with 2 degrees, one in Graphic Design and one in General Studies (both with honors), she set her sights on San Jose State University.
At SJSU, she worked very hard to qualify for the BFA program in Graphic Design. Lou received the Fang Quai New Media Achievement Award for a 3 part video series in 2011. In 2013 she graduated early from the Fine Arts program with honors and moved to Washington state with her husband.

</div></div>","Short Summary
 
Knick Knax is a fun and colorful puzzle game experience for all ages. The game follows Bobo and Kiki, two adorable sock monkeys, as they search for creative ways to reunite with their friends.
Players progress through a world of common everyday settings but from the perspective of a small stuffed animal. The player is encouraged to explore the environment for solutions to physics-based platforming puzzles. By manipulating the world around you, the player can create bridges that span otherwise impossible chasms and obstacles.
The game will also include a level editor that allows players can create and share their own levels.
The team is working very hard at creating an experience that can be enjoyed by anyone. In fact, our playtests have already shown high levels of kid approval:

<p>Representatives of the five mega-corporations led all mankind and made people look into deep space. People entered the phase of active colonization of our ""Milky Way"" galaxy and mining of its resources.</p>

<p>300 years passed. Communication with the outside world is still absent, and no one knows about its fate. Mankind is firmly seated in the sector, having organized a powerful army and uninterrupted production of resources. Followers of the five corporations collaborate to create an empire called Oligarchy.</p>

<p>Revolution (Duplicates called that himself) decided to blow up one of the stars in the controlled sector. This star was extremely rich in minerals, and its explosion would undoubtedly attract the forces of Oligarchy. It was an ambush.</p>

<p>The ships of Oligarchy and Revolution were immediately losing their neural network as a result of strong gamma radiation. Nobody understood what caused this effect. Biodroids rebooted and lost memories. They acquired something inherent only to the people, namely the soul. None of the parties could find an explanation for this phenomenon.</p>

<p>3600. ""Emancipated"" (the name of biodroids who gained the soul) joined the ranks of Revolution and Oligarchy. Some of them still considered themselves a duplicate, guided by the fact that they have a synthesized modular body.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1225501/files/20150216063824-Why_Indiegogo.jpg?1424097504"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After watching our game trailer you probably think whether these guys undertake too much. You know, this is an ambitious game requiring great efforts and cash investment. The more so, because we’ve already made a good start and that’s mean we’ve already expended a lot of money! What else could we ask for?</p>
<p>Figuratis technologies is rather a small studio. There are just 30 of us. And we used to develop 2D games for browsers and mobile devices. We started working on Ares project almost two years ago. We faced different challenges, but we overcame all the difficulties. As the result we assembled a very strong team of developers and obtained a lot of experience. Now it is the moment when we need to push our game.  The game is subsidized by a private investor. For now his input into the game averages a million dollars.  We hope our development reflects the expired costs. Our investor is a shrewd businessman and to continue the sponsorship he asked us to confirm the demand for our game. He wants to be sure that it will be really popular among space-shooty game fans. That’s why we decided to refer to the Indiegogo.</p>
<p>The sum we ask for is approximately 30% of our budget. However for our investor this will be a clear proof that the game is in demand. This  money is enough to release an alpha-version of the game, which can be played by space-shooty game fans so they would be able to tell their friends about the new game “Ares: Wings of discord”. Of course, this will give us as the developers the confidence to drive the nail home.</p>
<p>If we miss our chance to make up the sum, we will stop dreaming of making a full 3D game version in the space-shooter genre forever. We’ll return to our far-back 2D games development orders. But we truly believe in players’ strength and desire to have as much beautiful and interesting games as it is possible, especially in space genre!</p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1225512/files/20150216064123-Who_we_are.jpg?1424097683"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Figuratis technologies is a new independent game development studio. Previously, we have specialized in creating 2D and 3D browser-based games. We have extensive experience in creating simulations of ground and air equipment, sports managers and educational games. Thanks to the Unity 3D, we make games for PC, consoles, tablets, and mobile devices. But we have always wanted more – to create an exciting space action shooter and gain new fans.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>At the very beginning we invited a science-fiction writer to construct an interesting and catching plot for us. But creation of some scenes took loads of energy and time. That’s why we decided to make a full educational mission and then to release further missions in the new game patches. <br/>We’ve made a multiplayer with a huge game world consisting of several sectors, and for each of them the forces of Oligarchy and Revolution will fight. There will be team missions’ performance and collective battles, which are great favorites of players. Working out of game balance and gaining of equal experience, game currency and resources demand a considerable amount of time. <br/>We do our best to make this game suitable for everyone. But now it’s necessary that as many players as possible discover our game. We have prepared a browser game version, so that everyone could visit our website and play alpha version. You just start the game from any computer in any place of the world. This is the supercharge for our developers. We had to considerably scale down graphics’ quality so that you could play using the browser. But this is temporarily. If we are supported by players, we will release client-side game version for the PC and consoles with original graphics and plot. This will undoubtedly be one of the most beautiful and exciting games in this genre!</p>
</div></div>","Ares Wings of Discord is a 3D game in the space shooter genre, which collected all the best that has ever been realized in the framework of this genre. The game will present you with many unique surprises designed to surprise and undoubtedly get fans of space shooters fall in love with it. 
   

Representatives of the five mega-corporations led all mankind and made people look into deep space. People entered the phase of active colonization of our ""Milky Way"" galaxy and mining of its resources.


Labor is scarce and corporations decide to lift the ban on human cloning. Clones are created with improved genome and modular transplantation of organs, they are called Duplicates.



Mass distribution of duplicates brought mankind to a new level of evolution and prosperity. 



Duplicates made the dirtiest and hardest work, and their work was equal to slave. 



Duplicates were not happy about his.Uprisings begin at different ends of the universe. 



Corporations send army units to suppress them. 



In one of the sectors of ""Betta"" dimension, the duplicates manage to undermine the portal that leads to the ""Eye of the crow"" galaxy. 



As a result, the forces of mankind have become cut off from the central command, and it did not make sense to wait for reinforcements. 



300 years passed. Communication with the outside world is still absent, and no one knows about its fate. Mankind is firmly seated in the sector, having organized a powerful army and uninterrupted production of resources. Followers of the five corporations collaborate to create an empire called Oligarchy.



Revolution (Duplicates called that himself) decided to blow up one of the stars in the controlled sector. This star was extremely rich in minerals, and its explosion would undoubtedly attract the forces of Oligarchy. It was an ambush.



But things did not go according to plan. Unexplained things began to occur in the galaxy. Microportals (galactic holes) suddenly open, leading into the unknown sectors. 



The ships of Oligarchy and Revolution were immediately losing their neural network as a result of strong gamma radiation. Nobody understood what caused this effect. Biodroids rebooted and lost memories. They acquired something inherent only to the people, namely the soul. None of the parties could find an explanation for this phenomenon.



3600. ""Emancipated"" (the name of biodroids who gained the soul) joined the ranks of Revolution and Oligarchy. Some of them still considered themselves a duplicate, guided by the fact that they have a synthesized modular body. Others likened themselves to people, because they had a soul now.  (See full Storiline in our site).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You start the game for the intelligence biodroid who was sent to take a soil sample from one of the asteroids. As a result of the production, you find some artifact, which reboots the system of the biodroid, and he regains consciousness. Commanders of Oligarchy and Revolution forces contact you immediately. You have to choose which of these factions to fight for.



Each faction has its own branch of the ships development and its own system of ranks. Each spacecraft can be improved and modified, improving armor and weapons. You will also find many additional boosts and weapons in the game, so that the battle would bring you maximum emotions and impressions.



The game world is divided into locations. Each location has its own gaming environment, scenery and objects. You can travel between the worlds through portals, mining resources and battling enemies.



You can open a special menu in the game to play the story quest, group mission, or participate in team battle. 



 As you can see, the game will be developed in three areas:

non-linear story quests written by science fiction author;
group missions;
team battles of different genres.

Like in any game, the player has a lobby where they could catch a breath between battles. The player base consists of 3 rooms: the cabin, the terminal of events and the hangar. The cabin stores artifacts and collectibles of the player. 



In the terminal, you can watch the latest events in the game, as well as get acquainted with the advertisements.


In the hangar, the player makes improvements to their ship and chooses weapons for their battles.
To date, the game is in a closed alpha testing. You can participate in it and share your impressions on our forum. We will inform you about new releases and our plans in the Newssection.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


After watching our game trailer you probably think whether these guys undertake too much. You know, this is an ambitious game requiring great efforts and cash investment. The more so, because we’ve already made a good start and that’s mean we’ve already expended a lot of money! What else could we ask for?
Figuratis technologies is rather a small studio. There are just 30 of us. And we used to develop 2D games for browsers and mobile devices. We started working on Ares project almost two years ago. We faced different challenges, but we overcame all the difficulties. As the result we assembled a very strong team of developers and obtained a lot of experience. Now it is the moment when we need to push our game.  The game is subsidized by a private investor. For now his input into the game averages a million dollars.  We hope our development reflects the expired costs. Our investor is a shrewd businessman and to continue the sponsorship he asked us to confirm the demand for our game. He wants to be sure that it will be really popular among space-shooty game fans. That’s why we decided to refer to the Indiegogo.
The sum we ask for is approximately 30% of our budget. However for our investor this will be a clear proof that the game is in demand. This  money is enough to release an alpha-version of the game, which can be played by space-shooty game fans so they would be able to tell their friends about the new game “Ares: Wings of discord”. Of course, this will give us as the developers the confidence to drive the nail home.
If we miss our chance to make up the sum, we will stop dreaming of making a full 3D game version in the space-shooter genre forever. We’ll return to our far-back 2D games development orders. But we truly believe in players’ strength and desire to have as much beautiful and interesting games as it is possible, especially in space genre!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figuratis technologies is a new independent game development studio. Previously, we have specialized in creating 2D and 3D browser-based games. We have extensive experience in creating simulations of ground and air equipment, sports managers and educational games. Thanks to the Unity 3D, we make games for PC, consoles, tablets, and mobile devices. But we have always wanted more – to create an exciting space action shooter and gain new fans. We are currently working on the game «Ares: Wings of discord».

<div><br/></div>Coward is a game about the cows, peacefully living in the small green village. Eating grass and making milk is interrupted by flying UFO pod above our black and white spotted friends.

We realised that making an indie game isn't a piece of cake as it seems to be. Especially when you have zero experience with developing games, total basic skill in programming and artistic soul, but also,  with basic drawing skills. But we managed to learn, learn, learn and learn. Designing was the funniest process, and most rewarding. We had tons of ideas, many times I have woke up in the middle of the night with blink of idea about new feature to a cows, and ran as fast as I could to draw it in our concept arts schedule. Right after designing, a programming and testing chapter came by, and it was painful. Many hours of sitting at one problem, which lead to another, and another, and another... Game is still in progress, but even if we doesn't hit our 1500 dollar goal, we will do this game anyway. Right now, it's somehow a part of our lives (even if it isn't the best game in the world).</p>

But creating games is pretty expensive, especially when you are still a high school student, and you are just starting out with a first project, like us. 




 Our main goal is 1500$. It's enough to cover all the licenses and software, and hardware that we need. We really appreciate every help in our case, so if you want to take action in bringing this game to life, but you can't donate us, it's not a problem! You can help us out with sharing this campaign to a friend or on facebook! 


                                       
 We make this game for at least a year by now. We realised that making an indie game isn't a piece of cake as it seems to be. Especially when you have zero experience with developing games, total basic skill in programming and artistic soul, but also,  with basic drawing skills. But we managed to learn, learn, learn and learn. Designing was the funniest process, and most rewarding. We had tons of ideas, many times I have woke up in the middle of the night with blink of idea about new feature to a cows, and ran as fast as I could to draw it in our concept arts schedule. Right after designing, a programming and testing chapter came by, and it was painful. Many hours of sitting at one problem, which lead to another, and another, and another... Game is still in progress, but even if we doesn't hit our 1500 dollar goal, we will do this game anyway. Right now, it's somehow a part of our lives (even if it isn't the best game in the world).

                          
                                                                    




                                 

Main risk is that we won't get funded, but we will create this game anyway. If it necessary, even in the next century.",31.0,1,"1 Campaign

 EPISODE 1 


 
Our main characters are Judas, Peter and John the Baptizer (left to right). They are wrongfully imprisoned inmates inside the Penitentiary within the city of Nemean. Together, they come up with an elaborate plan to escape toward a Messiah who's supposed to save them.
 


 



 
Breaking out of a city wide prison is no easy task. No inmate has ever escaped the high level security from the Enforcers around Nemean. However, with the Games coming to town, everybody will be focused on that. John, Peter and Judas see this as an opportunity to evade the Enforcers but they need to create more distractions. 
 


 
Peter's mission is to become the ""rabbit"". He gets into a car and begins a high speed chase with Enforcers around the city. As he drives, he also destroys the Power Stations fueling the security around the city. While all eyes are on Peter in the car and John at the stadium, Judas is working behind the scenes. 
 
 


 

EPISODE 2


 
Episode 2 focuses on the present stage with the shocking arrest of John the Baptizer. Herod and the Union move into crowd control and Saul is presented as the lead investigator of the Nemean Escape. Saul discovers that during the car chase, someone broke into the Security Tower and scrambled the system allowing many inmates to escape including John, Peter and Judas. His mission is to figure out how and why. 
 

 
Saul finds footage of Judas breaking into the Security Tower. The investigation unravels as you piece together what happened that night in Nemean.
 


 
Herod and Saul plot against the Messiah. His lawsuit against the Union for the false imprisonment of John the Baptizer is a problem for Herod. Saul sees closing this case as a new opportunity to reach the height of his career, as a Minister.

Risks & Challenges

We are currently developing Episode 3 and 4, the final episodes of the first book. We are also preparing the rest of the books. For us to do this at the highest level, we need to continue to build our community and investment to fund our team needs. With your help and support, we will finish this project and bring you more play to the Bible.

Try to survive among the giant animals. Protect yourself from huge raindrops,  build your buildings that can survive against strong winds. Defend your food and your home from the hungry ant colonies.With up to 8 player co-op support, connect with your friends through an endless adventure and challenge that will test more than your skill! The idea of Smalland was a passion for us, we could combine the features we haven't seen in many survival games. We made a decision in January of 2017 and we started developing Smalland project.Just as many of you've done, we played some of the survival games and noticed we can add more features that we really want to see. A survival game that has great ecosystem and weather conditions that affect everything in the world.It sounds great? Definitely.So we decided to make this idea real.Ants are bringing the foods to their colony.An ordinary day in the Forest.Too much rain and a bit windThe problem we see in some survival games is not having enough interaction with the world. Weather conditions or that kind of things are not affecting you most of the time.At this point, we've shrunk down you to the size of tiny animals and we forced ourselves into improving interaction issues. Weather conditions' results couldn't be ignored anymore. That was a great challenge, but we love that. This project started developing with two friends at January 19th. We were talking about survival games while waiting our delayed flight in İstanbul. While discussing how survival games could be better, we found ourselves talking about survival game that combined with shrunken people. We found that idea very excited and we start to work.We have already done some small projects with the Unreal Engine. These were more for learning purposes and none were shared. We've created the basics of the game and we're starting to develop them.Within a short time, we had a nice, stable working demo. Our ecosystem was very primed yet, but seeing our stuff was great. We were excited.We continued to develop the basics of the project, and we reached the stage we could show you. Then we realized that we need a budget to develop a much more detailed game.Also, everything we showed so far has been done about 10 months, so we have no doubt we can finish the work.We are ambitious, and we know, with your help everything is possible.The most important thing that defines the world of Smalland is that things get crazy when you shrunk.This concept provides us an incredible space. We can make a pretty spirited nature, use other animals that we don't often see and change the rules of survival. It is possible to make a lot of creative stuff in The World of Smalland. So we started to design the world. You were small. That means tall grasses, giant animals, and too much space. This factor changed every rule. For example, you wouldn't be concerned about foods, because if you could find an apple and keep it, you wouldn't be hungry for a long time.But that was not all. Everything that we put on the map should have an effect on gameplay. For example, when it rains in game, nature becomes foggy and you hear the rain sound. It's not usually more than visual and atmosphere. But when you become small, rain can hurt you. You can see so many things that are affected by rain. And we can use all of these details on Smalland's worldApart from these, if you just want to look around, we have breathtaking graphics that we really work on it. You can watch the life of nature or the sunset of the sun with the Peaceful mode.And downsizing gives you an opportunity to enter and explore many places where people of normal size cannot do. Just in case, make sure you do not enter into the sewer when it's rainy.Strong Ecosystem:  Imagine every animal in the world trying to survive. Even you don't do anything, they will continue their life. Ants take food to their nests for preparation. Mice are hunted by cats and life goes on.In this harsh world, you have to get to the top of the food chain as a tiny human. Life goes on while you're in a tree's branch or sleeping among the grasses. The world is full of life and struggle. And you are part of this.By the way, be ready when you're done with your building. You can be visited by ants or other hungry animals.High-Detailed Weather System: In Smalland, The Weather is more than just a feature. As the weather conditions directly determine the behaviors of the animals, it makes nature incredible change. The Rain can turn the terrain into a pond. Weather conditions are important elements that you have to be really careful.After the rain, places were floodedFlood System:  When it rains for a time, low or pitch surfaces can be flooded.  If you've built your house on some of the low surfaces or you've forgotten to put the roof and it's raining, you can lose your house, your items etc. How much it will damage depends on rain type and how long it happens. So rains could be really dangerous.For now, this system is not physical because of optimization issues and we don't have enough knowledge. With the campaign, we can have a shot to make it physical.Treehouse that is blown by The WindWind System One of our earliest planned features. If the wind is strong enough, it can blow so many things away. Your items, your body, even your building.  So when you build something, you must choose the right place or make your building strong enough. If you are outdoors, trees or giant things can be a lifesaver.And don't forget, you can make the wind your friend and you can have fun with it.Building System: While we're developing the Building System, we wanted to keep it simple for players, so we separated the interface of building system from Inventory and when we opened the building menu, we let you go to building mode and that made things easy for players. Now you don't have to break the walls which you didn't like, you can just open the building menu and you can add new structures, change their locations, repair or destroy them with the simple interface.Along with all this, the Building System shows you the weak places in your building, calculate your buildings' total power or defense points, even it shows the parts of the house where cannot stop the wind. That's more than just a building system.Stealing EggsHunting: Little people also have to hunt. As you can hunt insects on the ground, you can climb huge trees to steal delicious bird eggs. But that would certainly be challenging for you. Hunting is most fun and dangerous face of the game.Train on the treeRail System: To admit, we've added this feature to have fun. If you can find a toy train, you must figure out the energy problem and build train tracks, you can use your train. Or you can just build train tracks and use mine carts. In the huge map of the game, you can quickly reach from one point to another and you can carry your things into wagons. It makes things safer, but you should still be careful. If it's a windy day and your train is moving on the tree, you can find yourself in the river.Race of RiverRiver Race: Are you bored and do you want to do something exciting? Angry River is waiting for you. You must find something that keeps you on the water's surface and you should call your friends. But we must warn you, this is a survival game and these races may cause death. you know how the danger can make things fun.Co-op: Connect with your friends through an endless adventure and challenge that will test more than your skill! Check the leaderboard to see where you rank around the world. If you don't care the leaderboard, it's not a problem. Enjoy!Creativity has been one of the most important things for us. Because there are lots of survival games and we wanted to make this one different. We had an idea about improving the gameplay of course, but it wouldn't be enough without an idea. So we shrunk you and everything has been changed. - It wouldn't easy like I said - For releasing the game, we designed a map which called ""Lake Side Cabin"" that you're mostly in wild forest. But that doesn't mean it will be the only map.Let's dream together.The first thing that came to our minds was throwing down shrunken people into an apartment or a city's center. When we imagined how much the rules of the game could change in this case, we realized that Smalland's concept offered us great opportunities. Smalland is being developed with the contribution of a lot more people than the two-man developer team. From the name of our game to the flood system, many of our features came from our brilliant community that is following our project. This proved us how important the community is and how successful we will be together.Join us and we'll make a great game with you. Share your ideas, ask your questions, discuss features that we made and we will do. Let's take a decisions together, and create a game we all love. Everything we've done so far has been with no budget. That means we had so many things to do. We will have much more time and resources to finish the features that we planned and make a product that we'd actually enjoy. We'll be able to hire people, use new technologies. We want to make this happen and we need your help. PledgesWe are two people and we want to spend our time improving the game for you. Physical pledges such as cups, t-shirts or printings could take a lot of time and cause tons of trouble, so we didn't want to offer physical pledges.What kind of pledge are we offering?What we are offering to you is the game which is spent more time on it. When we release the game during the early access period, we want to give you the best Smalland experience with the least problem. We are offering a mention in the game credits as a backer in Smalland game platform, Your help is very important for us, and we'll do our best.10 top backers will hold the top place in the backer’s section in the game credits and on the website.We prepared an FAQ section for Indiegogo campaign and Pledges.BUDGETWith the budget, we'll have an opportunity for developing the features that we promised. We'll hire people, and that will allow us to focus more on gameplay and we can finish things earlier then we planned. From new graphics technologies to better software, we'll be able to access everything we needed.It's a simple breakdown of how we will use the budget.There are also many other features we want to add to the game. We listed them for you. If you support us beyond the project's goal, we will use these additional resources to grow our studio to make our work faster and adding new features that can make the game better. We are an enthusiastic and passionate team of two people who have made small game projects for learning purposes. We are now developing Smalland and we want to introduce ourselves to you! Our system requirements based on of the Unreal Engine 4 recommended specifications. They are subject to change based on further development.

Eidolons: Netherflame is the answer to this question.  Anphis val Keserim. Even for a champion of the most sinister cabal in Ersidrian history, a sorcerer nigh without equal, his ambition has ever bordered on insanity.Why else would the pre-eminent mage lord, Congregation’s field general and the right hand of the brotherhood’s grandmaster, turn and become a renegade?But to slay a god, even a sorcerer such as he needs powerful weapons. So Anphis set out to seek Netherflame, grim legacy of the Primordial Gods.And on this quest, the dark mage has met his end – or so it is said.Now the many who hated and feared him speak with relish of how his shattered soul is no doubt doomed to be food for the dreaded fiends of the Nether Realm. But a few who knew him better silently wonder - was it all part of his plan? Following his apparent demise as a mortal, Anphis - whether or not per his plan - finds himself in the haunted desolation of the Sleeper Realm, a place only vaguely hinted at in the histories of the sunlit world. His awakening from the deathly slumber will not be an easy one - for a source such as he cannot hope to elude the notice of darker, ever ravenous entities. From there, he embarks on a mystical and dark journey through the Nether Realm. Against all odds, he must carry out the grim quest he set out to do, alone.Yet even in the haunted desolation, he is not without guidence. His own fractured psyche has given birth to a multitude of voices, some wise, some insane. And then there is another, more soothing voice for Anphis to take comfort in.The Seer bound her life and soul to Anphis, become the one bridge that can take him back to the world of the living, albeit at grim price.  In the end, the story of Eidolons asks a number of tenuous questions.What is a soul? What can change it? Is it so wrong not to care about others? And what is the price one pays for it? You will have to find your own answers. In Eidolons: Netherflame you play as Anphis and follow his rise as the last Eidolon Lord. In tribute to a certain tradition, the campaign is made up of 4 Acts, each set in a different location. Starting in the deepest recesses of the Nether Realm, the journey takes you through a vast ancient castle drifting in the dark void, and finally, back to the mist-veiled lands of Ersidria and to a place of vengeance.Each Act contains several hand-crafted levels full of secrets and hazards plus a few larger randomized dungeons in-between.After the introductory Act I where you test your powers, the game lets you play one of four of characters. In his quest for  power, Anphis found unlikely allies - a group of former Wardens, deserters from the Order of Veil. Their pact seemed fragile, yet it held through, for the regenegade Wardens were called by the very power he sought, as was foretold by Selene. Together they set out to the Isle of Gods to challenge a mythic creature in whose lair lay the last pure seed of the Netherflame. Their daring quest proved ill-fated, and in the end only four Wardens were left standing by the sorcerer's side. Just enough to perform the ritual that Selene had planned for.Few could fathom what happened next, but now the pale remnants of the intrepid four are chained to Anphis with a blasphemous magic, and his own soul fractured and trapped between worlds.Over the course of your journey, you will perhaps learn what had really happened. And you will learn of the Wardens, their bleak past and failed hopes. And at the end of it, you will have a chance to save them - or make final use of their sacrifice and consign them to eternal torment.In each mission, you have one ‘life’ on each of the four Eidolon heroes, and cycle through them as they die. If none are left, the mission is failed. Saves are allowed only between missions, making each a singular challenge to overcome - true to the roguelike spirit at the heart of the game. As an Eidolon Lord you will claim the souls of the fallen and use them as you see fit - to imbue items with magical properties, to cheat death or briefly assume your true form - a deathly shadow that withers all it touches, but cannot long withstand the weight of existence. Hero Creation The game offers an open-ended hero progression system with over 40 Skill Trees, 10 Class Trees and 21 school of magic. In Netherflame campaign, you will begin with the base of your four Eidolon heroes - a fiery barbarian, a valiant Shieldmaiden, a crafty Dwarf headhunter and a Dark Elf assassin.After the classic part where you distribute points between yours base Attributes, you are fully the architect of your hero. You invest into one of multiple Mastery types available to the hero, by which you craft hero’s own Mastery Tree. Then you fill it with Skills of your choosing, though you never had quite enough XP to get all there is, so you have to choose wisely. Class system works in a similar way - only instead of the more generic Mastery, you must earn Class Ranks - e.g. Fighter, Assassin or Battle Mage - and fill your personalized Class Tree with special perks, such as Last Man Standing or Berserker Blood. Each Class has a number of tiers and is in itself a tree, so a Fighter for instance may progress along the Soldier > Veteran > Paragon branch or perhaps along the Warrior > Gladiator > Berserker, with other choices at every step.There are 10 base classes and a total of 70 Class Ranks, each with its own lore and unique abilities and stats impact.   .The main idea behind combat in Eidolons is to base it solidly in reality and then make it turn-based. The result was a curious combination of HoMM5-inspired ATB system, atomic actions and real-time basis that makes intuitive sense. In action, it feels natural, and you do not have to think about it as a special ruleset.  To succeed, you must be aware of what each enemy can do at each point in time. Can you sneak by this slow axeman while he’s still getting his bearings, or will you pay with a limb for it? Can you step out of that tree, shoot an arrow and step back without having this wizard discharge his lightning bolt at you?These things will become intuitive quickly, so the flow of possibilities and dangers will race through your mind as you re-align your strategy with each new development. No one takes too many hits to bring down, so you will have to watch it!You can read a more in-depth breakdown of the combat system in this devlog entry.   ...fragments of the sacred Oversoul, they are a primeval force set on a path of destruction. Their power is essential if we are to succeed in the final test. They will not part with it willingly. As in Dark Souls, Boss fights have a special place in Eidolons gameplay, and are made to feel brutal and epic, test your mastery and resourcefulness.To prevail, you will have to use all 4 of your heroes to prevail, play your hand smartly, calling on the Eidolons of your Chain and managing your Soulforce.In boss fights, you must win 3 rounds, and in each one they will assume a form closer to their original one, becoming increasingly surreal. And what works against one form may prove futile against the other, so you have to change your tactics accordingly.             Edalar, the eldest of the nine worlds on our plane, is a world that has had a good life. Its history is filled with visions of wonder, glory and ruinous fury. Now its time is almost at an end, the twelth age is drawing to a close and Edalar, like many worlds before it, must go back beneath the Veil, into the Grey, merge with the Underverse and bow to the Nether Gods’ will. It must, but will it? Edalar is now ruled by Man, and his lust for power - mundane and arcane - has never been stronger. Indeed, mankind is now at the brink of a revolutionthe technological progress - denied them for many centuries by the brutality of war and ancient gods - now finally seems within grasp.For five centuries, there has been relative peace and undisturbed progress Led by the wise and honorable dynasty of the long-living Eresars, the realms of Allkingdom prospered and shed the haunting ghosts of their past. All except for Ersidria. Here the hammer of war and sorcery fell the heaviest - and the land could never recover. Nor could the people, descendants of the once-proud Valherim, lords of Sea and Stone, brought low and conquered by the allied armies of the Young Kingdoms. The Red Priests of Ardai have denounced their gods and brought their own to replace them, fire and steel in their wake.            Yet for all the misfortune that befell the distant realm, it never lost a certain air of grandeur. That, and the allure of freedom, the vane glory of legends from ages past, and the wanton rule of violence attracted those for whom the Allkingdom no longer had a place. Mercenaries, disgraced knights, fanatics, dangerous free-thinkers and over-ambitious wizards. And of course, simple criminals. Such is the boiling pot of chaos where the world’s fate must be decided. Yes, it will be here, deep within the twilit mist of whispering groves, beneath the leaden skies, enclosed by the mournful seas, on fields of battles past. It will be in Ersidria.  You can read more about the game's extensive lore in its arcane blog!  What people say about Eidolons? The project has only recently been made public, but already a few people have covered our latest news - the release of the Backer Demo!Here is the first part of it - don't worry, it does not contain too many spoilers, only the guided/tutorial part and stops when the free fight begins.  A few articles also already appeared in the press - https://www.onrpg.com/videos/eidolons-netherflame-beta-is-on-indiegogo-for-all-backers/https://www.geekgeneration.fr/eidolons-netherflame-la-beta-indiegogo-est-disponible/https://www.mdegaming.at/eidolons-netherflame-soulslike-trifft-auf-taktik-rpg/https://arata.lat/eidolons-netherflame-tiene-beta/  On top of the obvious - the game key and backer demo - we are offering a wide range of digital rewards to our backers, including art, music, special access and more! Most rewards can be delivered immediately, but some may take more time. Everything will be delivered before end of October 2019.Contains full introduction into the story, a short (and cruel) tutorial, boss fight and a castlefloating in hell to explore. It contains following modules from Act I of the Netherflame Campaign:
The Awakening (cinematic story introduction),
Duel in Flames (combat-tutorial),
Dark Ascension (atmospheric exploration, puzzles and free combat)
Delivered as a Steam key or as custom download link on request. (Note that the demo will receive updates via Steam)In addition to the basic version, Extended Demo will offer you a glimpse from Act II of the Netherflame Campaign - a harrowing adventure into the depths of the fallen fortress of Nyrn. Get the game as soon as it comes into Early Access this year! Independent* of our crowdfunding results, Eidolons will be in Early Access on Steam before the end of 2019. Early Access version will provide between 5 and 7 hours of play (and receive regular updates), while the full version with the entire Netherflame Campaign - 15 to 25 hours of play and considerable replayability (as you may start with any of the 4 Acts).*The results of this campaign could speed up the full release, which right now scheduled for 2020.The very first entry in the musical journey of Eidolons was made by Edwin Pickett, it is made for maximum immersion  - the seamless looping lets you listen for hours. I for one certainly do while I code away in the murky depths!Comes with two special bonus tracks composed by Edwin Pickett. Listen now on soundcloud! Dark and Epic, the score of Eidolons: Netherflame is over an hour long and will be your loyal companion on dark winter nights ahead, as it hails from frosty Finland!You can get a taste of its deep melancholy in the bonus track ""Fractures"". The legend says that it was composed in a day and a night in a sudden flare of long brooding passion. They also hint that took a while of to arrive at that epic moment however.For myself, I can only say it was a great pleasure for me to see this musical journey unfold, to offer ideas and and share materials that I hope have largely inspired Mika in his creative process.  A package of 25 hero portraits very well suited for customizing your character in games like Baldur’s Gate, Neverwinter Nights or just on your favorite RPG forum.A package of 15 Full HD Wallpapers with multiple resolution, color and contrast versions.If you need custom resolution, you need only ask.A special edition of our digital art collection, it is packed with art made over at least 5 years and contains work of over a dozen artists. From classic character art to maps and sketches, vague dreams and sublime visions of a future not yet arrived – it has it all!The main part contains over a hundred monsters, two dozen heroes, various landscapes and a full arsenal of animated weaponry. In the Appendix you will find stranger things and abstract art. Many of the pieces come with personal commentary about the inspiration for and process of its creation.Each page is print-friendly! The Ersidrian peninsula is a place where ages, cultures and biomes all clash together in an arduous mayhem. It is roughly one tenth of the known surface of Edalar.This epic map of it was drawn by Steffen Sommer based on my sketches and texts. It took almost a year to complete and the mutual creative process fueled my passion for the project and its lore. I personally think that Steffen’s passion for original works of J.R.R. Tolkien shines through every pixel of it!On top of the original version, the item package will include multiple Full HD (and larger) versions with atmospheric lighting and weather effects, best suited for your desktop!High DPI makes it look perfect when printed as well. So decorate that living room wall with a bit of fantasy art! An in-game book collection of dark lore with total of at least 50 pages, it is made up of maniscripts of varying degree of completeness and sanity. Together they offer a window into the grand and crazy vision that is Eidolon Multiverse that grew over many years.Become part of the creative process! Get the original design document, and help us create an NPC or a side-quest for the Netherflame campaign!  Get access to a tester branch of the game with latest builds all the way to the full release in 2020!Indulge your curiousity and ask the team any single question about Eidolons!Note that while you can ask anything, and the answer will be full and completely honest, it must of course remain strictly confidential. Some things are not meant to be known by the many, only the few...Want the dark secret to be your own?  Then give us something you wish to be an easter egg in the game! Subject to reasonable approval.Get access to a private Backer or Dev channel on discord and a special role to go with it! The whole Wyrmring team is there too :)Speaking of which...   The game is largely developed as a solo project by Alexander @EiDemiurge Kamen, but over the years a number of people have contributed to making this vision come true.  If you would like to know more, this interview here sheds more light on how this came game to be - and bears witness to how much I had underestimated the effort to launch a crowdfunding campaign! All the more grateful to Marcello from @turnbasedlovers who gave me the much needed chance to speak up about the shrouded roots of the project at that time!  And here is the more complete list of contributors: Denis Lola - technical assistanceAndrey Zarkly - character art and lineart for this campaignPavel @Broojacker - sound design and music Davide Pessach - counseling and marketingSteffen Sommer - original map and icon artEdwin Pickett - ambient and theme musicAlexander @Shadeborn - voice actingArtem @Stargrave - landscape artArtem Akmulin - music I also express my gratitde to these amazing people from Freesound.org:InspectorJKlankbeeld Farbe1001Cabled-messUagaduguAdamgryuDigifishmusicErdieAlso special thanks go to these brave and patient testers!Malik ArrumYa-Seencousity KorikabuAyechihuahua Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to my brother Ilya for his insightful advice and his wife Maria for putting her manager skills to use in our nightly battle-plan sessions. I couldn't have done this without you  guys :)The project needs more full-time professional help with its art and sound design, and the current team members need to pay their bills! :)The most relevant and immediate factor however is whether Alexander Kamen will afford to work full-time all the way through to release, or have to do freelance or get a programmer job to pull it through :)   Eidolons is an innovate hybrid between roguelike and cRPG. Like all things new, there is a space for growth, but also the danger of not being quite understood - or properly executed - in the absense of a well-trodden path.This is my main personal concern. Then there is of course always the project’s somewhat low bus-factor.However, despite its solo-dev origins, the project is structured in a modular way to allow for easy contribution of more people, if it has the the financial means to ensure their welfare.Eidolons project is my life, and I am determined to realize it in some form no matter what. I see see it as a chance start a change in the genre that has, from my perspective, been walking around in circles for decades now.",56.0,1,"1 Campaign

<li><p>Im a enthusiastic programmer from Germany of games, game engines and mods.</p></li>
<li><p>I really like physics based games like Half-Life 2 and action story games like Metro or Stalker.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm trying to combine story, physics, quests and action into a new 2d game with the focus on quests, which are rich in variety and fun to play. I'm also building some minigames for quests for example like hacking and lockpicking. But some quests are also simple for you: To open a certain door why not shooting some ropes and some heavy old debris from a crane will open it for you.<br/>I will also implement some easter eggs and quests for you, which are based on real world conspiracy theories, but the community should also have a chance to decide how. We will read doodles and look at your suggestions!</p></li>
<li>
<p>I would really love to develop this game further, so it can be an unique experience for you and for me!</p>

But some quests are also simple for you: To open a certain door why not shooting some ropes and some heavy old debris from a crane will open it for you.I will also implement some easter eggs and quests for you, which are based on real world conspiracy theories, but the community should also have a chance to decide how. We will read doodles and look at your suggestions!

I would really love to develop this game further, so it can be an unique experience for you and for me!
Best regards and have fun,
Mario

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Hi everyone, we are Surprised Monkey Studio</strong>, creators of ""<strong>Surviving the Humans</strong>"" and we couldn’t be more excited to tell you all about our new project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608777573/v5ffcdgto9qb5xcr3wgu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Surviving the Humans is a 2D point-and-click adventure-style video game. Where we can be part of a very enriching story of a misunderstood zombie in the 80s. An epic and never seen before story with a fully hand-drawn unique style.</strong></p>
<p>We took the liberty to paraphrase Nelson Mandela, since we belive what he said applies perfectly with the game:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite. "" </i></p>
<p><i>By Nelson Mandela</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are sure you remember what a blast you had solving a lot of puzzles in those adventure games we all used and use to love still, such as Monkey Island, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, and many others. That is why nothing would make us happier if you feel the same way as you did before with our game.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608777681/jgxpjws3siegu7ekk3sa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Main Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have to collect items, use them in the correct places to solve the puzzles and help Cooper in this new adventure.</li>
<li>Hundreds of interactive objects and a few easter eggs with funny descriptions.</li>
<li>Mini-games to test your skills.</li>
<li>A suspenseful and one-of-a-kind story.</li>
<li>Multiple characters, locations, and items.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608778018/hiwawrasce1wdjj7uxba.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The story was worked on for several months.<strong> It is mainly based on the story of Cooper, a zombie who rises from his grave in the 80s in a cemetery knowing absolutely nothing about his past. We accompany and help him throughout an epic story where he learns what it means to be a zombie and how to change human's misconception about it's kind. But beware, you should not let your guard down and try at all times to survive the attacks and intolerance of people.</strong> </p>
<p>We belive that a story like this was never told before, that zombies always have to be bad, murderous, and monstrous. That is why we always try to approach things from another perspective, and this game seeks that same thing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cooper:</strong> is our main character and antihero. He did not choose to become a zombie, but life (or death) had given him a second chance to make an impact.  Now he has to learn his new nature and it's ways. Each action we take will have an impact on the rest of the members of the town, thus setting in motion a compelling story. </p>
<p>His body is in full rot and it is difficult for him to keep his limbs together, but gladly he has a lot of ingenuity and he will use it to achieve his goals.</p>

You want to have control over everything and everyone, controlling and obsessive. Unsure of himself. He hates zombies.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Anne:</strong> A mainly very sensitive woman, who is afraid of abrupt changes. She is tender and a romantic woman. He likes a lot to walk and be outdoors. She has a bit macabre taste, a fan of horror movies and things a bit sordid. She has curls and a freckled face, she is quite small physically and practically without strength.

We want it not to be just another graphic adventure, but to innovate new mechanics with a fluid and responsive gameplay. Our former hometown will be our playground, but this time surrounded with a culture full of changes as were the 80s. Not only are we going to try to stay ""alive"", but we are also going to take care of those that matter the most to us, and if necessary, to strike back, not with force, but with our ingenuity, since our nature and rotten body won't stand a chance in combat.</p><p><strong>Movement:</strong> we can automatically go to the objects location by clicking them, but also move to wherever we want with WASD and the arrows.</p><p><strong>Interaction with objects: </strong>When pressing on an object, the interactive menu appears that allows us to Grab the object, Examine it, or Talk to it.</p><p><strong>Use of objects:</strong> items can be used directly by dragging and dropping them from the inventory onto other objects in the scene.</p><p><strong>Mini-games: </strong>Mini-games are always necessary for an adventure. As in monkey island, it is the battle of the sword, in ""Surviving the humans"" we created the battle of fear. Zombies are slow to catch their victims, so they depend on their skill to throw out a terrifying phrase and petrify their victims with fear. Practice makes perfect, so we must first practice with other zombies in the graveyard.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609012614/sz7cd6aoibfhaqtacsid.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609012644/iefhqkjmbwkj1azfyiob.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/7haELbESygFjvNJriY/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For us, <strong>the art of the game is essential</strong>.

When we have it ready, we pass it to Unity and apply all kinds of post-processing effects to achieve the final result.</p><p>The steps for the creation of art.

Hi everyone, we are Surprised Monkey Studio, creators of ""Surviving the Humans"" and we couldn’t be more excited to tell you all about our new project.

Surviving the Humans is a 2D point-and-click adventure-style video game. Where we can be part of a very enriching story of a misunderstood zombie in the 80s. An epic and never seen before story with a fully hand-drawn unique style.
We took the liberty to paraphrase Nelson Mandela, since we belive what he said applies perfectly with the game:
 
""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite. "" 
By Nelson Mandela
 
We are sure you remember what a blast you had solving a lot of puzzles in those adventure games we all used and use to love still, such as Monkey Island, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, and many others. That is why nothing would make us happier if you feel the same way as you did before with our game.

 
Main Features:

You have to collect items, use them in the correct places to solve the puzzles and help Cooper in this new adventure.
Hundreds of interactive objects and a few easter eggs with funny descriptions.
Mini-games to test your skills.
A suspenseful and one-of-a-kind story.
Multiple characters, locations, and items.

 

The story was worked on for several months. It is mainly based on the story of Cooper, a zombie who rises from his grave in the 80s in a cemetery knowing absolutely nothing about his past. We accompany and help him throughout an epic story where he learns what it means to be a zombie and how to change human's misconception about it's kind. But beware, you should not let your guard down and try at all times to survive the attacks and intolerance of people. 
We belive that a story like this was never told before, that zombies always have to be bad, murderous, and monstrous. That is why we always try to approach things from another perspective, and this game seeks that same thing.
 
Cooper: is our main character and antihero. He did not choose to become a zombie, but life (or death) had given him a second chance to make an impact.  Now he has to learn his new nature and it's ways. Each action we take will have an impact on the rest of the members of the town, thus setting in motion a compelling story. 
His body is in full rot and it is difficult for him to keep his limbs together, but gladly he has a lot of ingenuity and he will use it to achieve his goals.
 Vincent: He is a zombie who lives in the cemetery, he is many years old and tries to share his experience with all the zombies. Very fearful of humans, since he has seen his zombie friends fall one after another. He's a mentor, used to getting new zombies under his wing quickly, helping them progress, and teaching them the basics so they can survive as long as possible. George: He is a zombie of British origin, a major general who was in the First World War. He is always at war, especially now with humans as they cause the casualties of his army of zombies. He is in charge of the security of the cemetery, he just wants to exterminate all humans, dominate the town and the world. For him, the cemetery is his fortress, his trench, he does not go out under any circumstances. Spencer: A portly human survivalist, always in camouflage clothing as if prepared for battle at all times. Low-mannered, sullen, and moody. He has a beard and always has a serious expression. He understands that the end of the world is near and he doesn't want to waste time socializing. You want to have control over everything and everyone, controlling and obsessive. Unsure of himself. He hates zombies. Anne: A mainly very sensitive woman, who is afraid of abrupt changes. She is tender and a romantic woman. He likes a lot to walk and be outdoors. She has a bit macabre taste, a fan of horror movies and things a bit sordid. She has curls and a freckled face, she is quite small physically and practically without strength. She works in the local cinema and on weekends in the capfeteria. She has 2 jobs since her boyfriend doesn't work and she has to support him. And many more...  The game will have 4 chapters where the situation will change dramatically.  Exploration: you will explore different locations, each and every one of them with many interactive objects, mysterious and spooky secrets to unveil. Much to explore, much to discover.Puzzles: you will put your brains to the use to solve the problems and obstacles that appear to Cooper. Only you can help him surpass them.Inventory: we have an inventory where we will store all the necessary objects to solve the puzzles and help us throughout our adventure. We will also be able to make combinations of certain items, to generate new ones.Dialogues: we will meet many characters throughout the story, and each of them has a story to tell. We are going to have to talk our way out, or we may need to convince them of certain things to advance in the story.Dismemberment: We can use Cooper's hand and head to overcome certain obstacles. Listening to conversations or seeing certain things from a small space is no longer a problem when we can leave our head anywhere, or use and interact with certain objects when our hands can perform tasks under our command.The main objective of ""Surviving the humans"" is to learn what it is to be a zombie. We want it not to be just another graphic adventure, but to innovate new mechanics with a fluid and responsive gameplay. Our former hometown will be our playground, but this time surrounded with a culture full of changes as were the 80s. Not only are we going to try to stay ""alive"", but we are also going to take care of those that matter the most to us, and if necessary, to strike back, not with force, but with our ingenuity, since our nature and rotten body won't stand a chance in combat.Movement: we can automatically go to the objects location by clicking them, but also move to wherever we want with WASD and the arrows.Interaction with objects: When pressing on an object, the interactive menu appears that allows us to Grab the object, Examine it, or Talk to it.Use of objects: items can be used directly by dragging and dropping them from the inventory onto other objects in the scene.Mini-games: Mini-games are always necessary for an adventure. As in monkey island, it is the battle of the sword, in ""Surviving the humans"" we created the battle of fear. Zombies are slow to catch their victims, so they depend on their skill to throw out a terrifying phrase and petrify their victims with fear. Practice makes perfect, so we must first practice with other zombies in the graveyard.       For us, the art of the game is essential. That is why we decided we wanted the whole game to be drawn by hand and with an unique style. We have a creative process in which we establish what we must do first, we make several sketches, and then the drawing process begins and ends with beautiful results. When we have it ready, we pass it to Unity and apply all kinds of post-processing effects to achieve the final result.The steps for the creation of art. First a sketch, then it goes to the pc, where the lines, shadows, and color are made. Then it goes to Unity where post-processing, effects and lighting are applied. And after all that, you can see that the results are amazing.As video games developers, with more than 10 years of acummulated experience as programmers, we took full advantage of Unity engine and built an architecture for the game from scratch. Generating our own cinematics, animations, and mechanics for the game. In the beginning, the game will be released for the platforms: PC, Mac, and Linux. If we manage to raise enough, we will launch on consoles.",26.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The game uses a mixture of sprites and handdrawn tiles. Sprites highlight interactable objects and NPCs while tiles on the other hand are mostly for atmospheric purposes.

Borrowing it from the bank always comes with high risks and seeing how other great RPGs were made possible due to all the generous people supporting their kickstarting campaigns, I'll put all of my faith into this one.
 
 

The game uses a mixture of sprites and handdrawn tiles. Sprites highlight interactable objects and NPCs while tiles on the other hand are mostly for atmospheric purposes. But making quality tiles (and especially sprites) takes a lot of time and money, so I want to invest the lion share from your contributions into art. Converting this construct into a sprite might be the hardest and most expensive thing to do, yet it should be worth it.Speaking of constructs, please check out the gallery for this campaign, as there are additional concept artworks for constructs and characters.For the soundtracks, most important characters have a unique battle theme.The ratio for ""battle-theme"" and all other soundtracks (including sounds) is planned to be around 40/60.
 
-Music-
The soundtrack for waking up in a peaceful place, protected by trees and its habitants.The normal battle theme against most enemies.The battle theme for Luka, the Gri. She's affinated with raising the dead and gives them orders for her own amusement.More to be added soon.

-About myself-I'm a young freelance game developer from Germany who's ready to make a  memorizable game for the world.My first game ""Sanatory Hallways"" for the Wii U was my first small step into the world as game dev and now with The Donnerwald Experiment I plan to make a notable impact in the Indie scene.I was already a gamer at a young age starting with the SNES.Over the years my love for RPGs skyrocketed with Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana and Pokémon and lately LISA the painful RPG as well as Undertale.Especially the Paper Mario series holds a special place in my heart and is the main inspiration for this project.Licenses/Credits for Open Source Resources",12.0,3,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>$2400.00   THE DETAILS ARE SKETCHY</b></p>
<p>I have quite a number of sketch books surrounding the JINKO project but this one that contains the very first, complete story outline in pictures and notes, all hand-done in ink and pencil. The notes have an inbuilt security system in that they are largely unreadable. (after all it was only me that had to read them! )Though the story has developed into a very different space, the early designs for characters, locations and set ups remain largely intact.  The outline wraps up just past halfway with the rest of the book containing random notes and designs. Some are more significant than others, but they all have the energy of the story.</p>
<p>This book has travelled first class, been lost on a Hong Kong ferry and worked in more cafes than a hyperactive barista.  It is very special to me for many reasons and as much as I don’t want to let it go, I think it has a special value in contributing to the further development of JINKO.</p>

<b>Creator – <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852244/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Deane Taylor</a></b><p>Deane Taylor is an award winning animation veteran who has worked on over 400 hours of television, ranging from <i>The Flintstones</i> through to <i>Ren and Stimpy</i>, <i>Cow and Chicken</i> and <i>Figaro Pho</i>. His most notable achievement was that of Art Director on Tim Burton’s Oscar nominated classic animated feature <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i>, which he regards as the most personally satisfying project of his career. </p>
<p><i>Jinko</i> has been in development for around ten years using a ‘slow cooker’ approach, according to Taylor. </p>
<p>‘For many years, I’ve wanted to tell Jinko’s story. Its appeal to me is in its ability to entertain while having a strong conscience. The story is about the futility of greed, and in deciding how best to illustrate this I’ve chosen animation. The language will be a carefully orchestrated blend of cinema and theatre, with a richly caricatured style which highlights the folly of the theme.’ </p>
<p>The strategy in building Jinko’s story was to treat it as a film first and a game second.  Regardless of the final product being one or the other, story is the critical factor and the film process is the most appropriate way to tell that.</p>
<p>The basic framework is a trilogy. Jinko’s journey takes us through her early life in a decayed and dying world followed by her years in captivity and, finally, to her discovery of a magical hidden paradise.</p>
<p>A five-act structure allows elements to unfold in an episodic chapter style, which easily adapts to the needs of gameplay.  </p>

</div></div>","The goal of crowdfunding Jinko is to create an incredibly impressive trailer in order to pitch to big league producers and gaming companies.  
Once we have a like minded Gaming company on board that's where the real fun begins.


THE GAMEThe story of Jinko breaks into 7 acts, each with its own genre of gameplay and unique design. As the story unfolds new characters rise and join your team, each offering a set of skills that Jinko can use and further develop. The opportunity for exploration is huge. From the densely populated Rat City through to the tribes of the impure there is no shortage of hidden secrets. THE STYLEThe animation style combines CGI, 2-D, stop-motion and puppetry. The story is not time specific. Design style blends familiar but distorted reality with total fantasy.  Jinko’s journey unfolds in two contrasting worlds, each with multiple locations ranging from grand scale to the intimate. THE FEATUREStory synopses and draft beats already exist making Jinko ideal for an animated feature at 110 minutes. This has primarily been created to explore the greater depths of the gameplay and feed into the cut scene potential. The story breaks into five acts with a prologue and epilogue. Each act is constructed chapter style, with transitions that create the ability for believable leaps in time and location as needed. Jinko is a mixed media fantasy adventure game for young adults.The protagonist is Jinko—an orphaned sea gypsy in search of her origin and an escape from the demons that plague her from within. The player shares Jinko’s experiences at the ages of 5, 8 and 15 years old. Intelligent and canny from the outset, she further develops her special abilities in order to face her darkest challenge.The antagonist is a vicious carnivorous Witch, at war with a crazed puppet Queen. In a futile battle of vanity and greed they threaten to destroy the subterranean paradise—a beautiful, but dangerous place at the centre of a world where lakes of molten opal lap at the edges of crystalline volcanoes, coral forests and upside-down, contorted glacial valleys.   Jinko can’t allow this unique world to suffer the fate of the one she has come from. She will challenge the Witch and the Queen under pirate law. Snakes and ladders, winner takes all! In resolving the conflict Jinko discovers this underground Eden is where she rightfully belongs. (1) STORY and SCRIPT (teaser)Confirm relevant story revisions and conform to final pass on teaser script. Prep for voice record.(2) PRODUCTION DESIGN (teaser)Finalise character design from early development conformed to recent research. Lead, secondary and incidental characters. Prep for storyboard needs first.Complete ‘above’ and ‘below’ world locations. Hero beats first, transitional second. Transitional pieces are for time distance and scale. Establish schematics and light direction, identify special conditions.(3) ART DIRECTION (teaser)Produce character color-all (take 01). Detail the hero locations and confirm additional light direction/atmospherics/FX (take 01).(4) STORYBOARD/COLOR SCRIPT (teaser)Plot the character beats, construct the stage, create the cinematic language and broad-stroke color for palette and light direction.(5) VOICE RECORD/EDIT/MUSIC/FX (teaser)Edit to beats and identify points of additional performance required and/or desired.(6) ADDITIONAL POSING/REVISE BOARD (teaser take 02/03)Key poses to enhance performance and establish additional character ticks.(7) FINAL MUSIC-FX-EDITProduction ready.$5.00   I'D JUST LIKE TO THANK... 
There are four different designs which is our way of somewhat individualising the email you receive. A small gesture to express our genuine thanks. 


$10.00   THE UNSUNG HEROES 
The support cast are a rich and varied mob, largely crafted on the fly while illustrating story-point. At other times they're created ahead of time to build a look and feel for a sequence. Whatever the point of origin, these guys are an all-important part of the production.
(below are examples of art available)



$25.00   THE STARS 
The lead characters are created in exactly the same way as the other cast with the exception that their deeper secrets are explored and their personalities exposed.    A lot more posing, a lot more expression, a lot more attention to costume. All the things that feed into creating a believable, engaging character.
(below are examples of art available)







$50.00   THE REAL THINGDrawing mug-shots of uniform size that go on the wall is an integral part of the character development and I have a bunch of these. I’ll keep the copies, you can have the originals. 






$90.00   THE EARLY STUFF

These are from the 'all sorts' basket. Character art, notes, locations, ideas. All of it is relevant as part of the organic nature of design and will feed into the final product.





$125.00   THE NOT SO EARLY STUFF

From the same basket, a little more developed. Some say a little prettier because of the colour and tone. I’d agree with that. Colour and tone is what knits the loose lines together.



$210.00   5 DROPS OF SINISTER SAUCE

Why are these my favourites? I take them everywhere I go. These drawings have flown first class, travelled on trains, been lost on Chinese ferries and sat in more cafes than George Clooney. 






 



$400.00   BRING ME THE HEAD OF JINKO

You can only go so far with a pen. In the hands of a talented sculptor you can speak louder with clay than words. For that reason Hayley Egan started on these without final design to see which direction it might fall into. All part of the organic process.









$500.00   SKYPE Q&A WITH DEANE TAYLOR 

There's so much great information out there for just about anything you need to know that I thought it worthwhile to focus on what I know best, the scribble factor.   I truly believe that the more fast and furious technique becomes available, the greater the need for basics. I’m happy to chat at length about the things that have helped me.        



$2400.00   THE DETAILS ARE SKETCHY
I have quite a number of sketch books surrounding the JINKO project but this one that contains the very first, complete story outline in pictures and notes, all hand-done in ink and pencil. The notes have an inbuilt security system in that they are largely unreadable. (after all it was only me that had to read them! )Though the story has developed into a very different space, the early designs for characters, locations and set ups remain largely intact.  The outline wraps up just past halfway with the rest of the book containing random notes and designs. Some are more significant than others, but they all have the energy of the story.
This book has travelled first class, been lost on a Hong Kong ferry and worked in more cafes than a hyperactive barista.  It is very special to me for many reasons and as much as I don’t want to let it go, I think it has a special value in contributing to the further development of JINKO.





Creator – Deane TaylorDeane Taylor is an award winning animation veteran who has worked on over 400 hours of television, ranging from The Flintstones through to Ren and Stimpy, Cow and Chicken and Figaro Pho. His most notable achievement was that of Art Director on Tim Burton’s Oscar nominated classic animated feature The Nightmare Before Christmas, which he regards as the most personally satisfying project of his career. 
Jinko has been in development for around ten years using a ‘slow cooker’ approach, according to Taylor. 
‘For many years, I’ve wanted to tell Jinko’s story. Its appeal to me is in its ability to entertain while having a strong conscience. The story is about the futility of greed, and in deciding how best to illustrate this I’ve chosen animation. The language will be a carefully orchestrated blend of cinema and theatre, with a richly caricatured style which highlights the folly of the theme.’ 
The strategy in building Jinko’s story was to treat it as a film first and a game second.  Regardless of the final product being one or the other, story is the critical factor and the film process is the most appropriate way to tell that.
The basic framework is a trilogy. Jinko’s journey takes us through her early life in a decayed and dying world followed by her years in captivity and, finally, to her discovery of a magical hidden paradise.
A five-act structure allows elements to unfold in an episodic chapter style, which easily adapts to the needs of gameplay.

Ammunition and upgrade canisters can be bought during missions with score.The second one is the standing with Moon Resources Corp. Each time beacon is deployed, the point added to your standing with Moon Resources Corp. These points can be used to unlock weapons. The number of the beacons that can be deployed is unlimited and supplied by Moon Resources Corp.UpgradesEvery weapon, its ammunition and astronaut equipment have up to 6 upgrades, 3 upgrades minimum. This brings total amount of upgrades for weapons and ammo alone to more than 50. Carrying capacity of ammunition can also be upgraded and is 12 levels each. Astronaut has 18 equipment upgrades - fuel tank, jets, and augmentations. This type of upgrades will reduce fuel consumption, movement efficiency and resistance against certain enemies and environments, and unlock ability to carry heavy weaponry, such as minigun, hand cannon and upgraded machine gun.Upgrade Canisters are required to upgrade equipment. Upgrade Canisters are remains of alien civilizations from earlier times, scattered around Moon, and also can be bought for score points from MR Corp.As you progress and upgrade the equipment, the weapon and ammunition for that weapon will become more and more powerful against enemies with resistances, and therefore more weapon choices to deal with them will be available.Below image of upgrades, available for machine gun.Please note that the values of upgrades are not final and will be balanced in the course of development.PuzzlesAll levels will have different puzzles to solve (1-3 per level) in order to progress through the game or find goodies.Player will have drones equipped which help explore the surrounding, to collect item required to solve puzzle from inaccessible to player areas, access switches behind obstacles, lure key monster etc. What is already in game

New Tabletop Games
Original Miniseries’
An Online Platform for the Tabletop Community
All current and future projects are available on the Space Tavern Games website. So we have turned to everyone to help make this happen!(unfortunately our funds are limited, so at the beginning of this campaign this is the only image we could afford to put in here. We hope you enjoy it.)With Your Support
We’ve set our goal at 5,000 because that will allow us to do the following;
Get the online store up and running.
Get started with our own original shows
However, if our initial goal is reached, we do have STRETCH GOALS! All of our stretch goals are listed below and our hope is to achieve enough funding to make Space Tavern Games our Full Time Job. This would also quite possibly create the greatest Game store ever.

The Impact
The impact Space Tavern Games is aiming for is one that could be groundbreaking. We want to shake the typical Hobby/Game shop structure and reputation, create great products, and have superior customer service and satisfaction.
The tabletop gaming community has never truly had a strong establishment for where developers and testers from all over can truly connect on the internet
Valhalla would have multiple social platforms built around an e-commerce webstore for any developer or publisher to put up any tabletop game to be on the market, gain a following, reach out to other circles within the tabletop realm and build a following for any game listed in our system.
We wish to bring tabletop gaming to the forefront of entertainment with our own original shows that highlight the positive impact of tabletop games.
Risks & ChallengesWe understand that the current trend of games are those played on the consoles or PCs. We believe however that there is something special about sitting down to play a game on a tabletop with friends and family. We want to join other companies and other gamers in making sure tabletop gaming pushes to the forefront alongside of other forms of gaming.
We are developing our own tabletop games, and some designed for younger kids
We want to help build a strong tabletop community for everyone out there.

<h2>UPDATE</h2>
<p>We've changed the game name from MOMENTUM to GRAVITY VECTOR due to the community's request since there are already two games on Steam called ""Momentum"" and ""inMomentum"".</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who are we?</strong></h2>
<p>We're a group of passionate game developers who wish to bring new experiences to players all around the world.</p>
<p>My name is Miljan Bojovic and I'm an IT Manager working in a clinic in Italy. As some of you may have noticed my name does not sound italian and in fact I'm not. I'm originally from Serbia.</p>
<p>I am also the CEO and Founder of <i><a href=""http://www.poliexa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">POLIEXA Entertainemnt</a></i></p>
<p>As I went to italy my parents bought us our first Console. Sega Mega Drive (also known as Sega Genesis). As soon as I started playing games on that little black box I realized my true passion. I wanted to be able to create those things, create games with my own stories. So after years I'm here with experience and tools to start doing it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What is this campaign about?</strong></h2>
<p>This campaign may seem the usual Indie video game and in fact it is. With the difference that this is our first step into something big. Everything starts small.</p>
<p>This game represents experience in game development and tests out our knowledge. </p>
<p>Helping this campaign to reach its goal is telling us ""We believe in your ideas"" and also contributing to something bigger than the game is.</p>
<p>Our real goal is to keep people curious about our future projects by showing them what we achieved with Gravity Vector in just our spare time which believe me it's not much.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why do we need funds?</strong></h2>
<p>Everything has a price and until now we've been relaying only on our own everyday financial resources. So we've been very limited to achieve different things such as acquiring testing hardware, audio or graphic assets for our project. Since our goal is to make a game that everyone can enjoy we're putting all out effort to bring the best of it but this requires financial resources.</p>
<p><strong><i><u>Why we need this much amount of money?</u></i></strong></p>
<p>I won't be able to be precise about how much we really need. The amount shown here is approximate to what we really need in order to accomplish this project and what we've already spent to bring the game where it is right now which I can safely say we've more than 50% of its final state of development.</p>
<p>Here are some investments we need to bring forward the whole project and assure we've be able to continue the pursue of our dream.</p>
<p>Testing Machines (Computer Hardware, software license etc...): 13500€ </p>
<p>Audio, Video, Sound and Graphics Assets: 2500€</p>
<p>Third Party Software Licensing: 3500€</p>
<p>Sound Engineering, libraries and audio hardware: 3800€</p>
<p>Website Management: 1600€</p>
<p><u><i>If funding will exceed the initial amount, the investments will go into Virtual Reality Hardware in order to start working on VR content.</i></u></p>

</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>What are the risks in this whole project? Well, as for everything there is a goal and a deadline to respect and we're doing our best to succeed in this. Our main challenge is to dedicate every minute of our spare time into Gravity Vector development. Even if the game is more than 50% done.</p>

Risks & Challenges
What are the risks in this whole project? Well, as for everything there is a goal and a deadline to respect and we're doing our best to succeed in this. Our main challenge is to dedicate every minute of our spare time into Gravity Vector development. Even if the game is more than 50% done.

<p>The non-profit Austin Toy Museum was established as a set of traveling exhibits that brought the childhood nostalgia of every 80's and 90's kid to life. After years of making the rounds, the Austin Toy Museum finally found a home in East Austin. Showcasing toys mostly from the 70's, 80's, and 90's! The primary focus of the museum is reliving the greatest decades of toys and gaming in an interactive way. </p>

<p>Hops &amp; Heroes Comics, currently the only 501(c)3 comic book store in America,  moved into Austin Toy Museum in December of 2016, upping the geeky goodness by providing current, classic, and variant comic books from all major publishers and top names in Indie comics as well. With a focus on promoting diversity, community involvement, education, and the neighborhood bar feel, Hops &amp; Heroes is paving the way for a new type of comic book store. </p>

<p>Our building is awesome to the max, a really gnarly place to hang out, but it's also in need of some wicked upgrades if it's going to be the powerhouse of  Nerdom we want to achieve. </p>
<p>Here's just a couple of things we're going to be doing to make the environment even more radical: </p>
<p>1) Welcome to the Warp Zone: We're bringing retro ""epicness"" to life by recreating the feel of your favorite arcades from the 80's. We'll be updating our arcade games, fixing some of the old ones, and bringing in the fun. So start saving those quarters because the days of trying to get the high score on Centipede and Ms. Pac-Man are about to return! </p>
<p>2) New AC units -- If you've been here in the summer months you know it gets a little warm. Turns out Texas is hot, and trying to cool off with just some wall units doesn't beat that Texas heat. Which is why we want to get a better cooling system to make your experience more enjoyable for those long hours playing Magic: The Gathering, or Galaga in Warp Zone.</p>
<p>3) Bigger, Better, Stronger displays -- Austin Toy Museum has a lot of rare and vintage toys to display, but not a lot of space to actually display them in. While the Toy Museum staff has been working to modify donated displays and build their own cases over the years, we're looking to expand and unify the experience so that there will always be a variety of toys set up in a dynamic way.</p>
<p>4) General repairs -- Our building is old. The kind of old that makes parachute pants look like the next fashion statement. So we'll be doing some necessary upgrades and modifications to really make the building fresh. </p>

<h2><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
<p>I have always dreamed to create a game. Years ago, I picked up my first game and I was obsessed. What I believe is that you can escape your problems and delve into a new world. With a new multiplayer type gameplay, you can be strategic and social at the same time.</p>
<p>I was thrust into a deep stage of depression and it felt like games were the only thing that kept me alive and happy. And I want other people to feel that way.</p>
<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>You may be thinking, ""there are so many MOBA games and almost all of them are exactly the same."" But this is different.</p>
<p>The concept is two teams of 3 battling off in a large battleground.</p>
<p>There is a base hidden somewhere on the map. The teams have to find it. Once you get to the base, you need to stay there for a total of a minute, with the timer restarting if you leave the base. Meanwhile, your team needs to defend and stay put at your base/take over the base.</p>
<p>Your character is a human, that you customize to your satisfaction. You start with just 1 or 2 weak abilities and 1 or 2 weak weapons. By playing and/or winning, you get cases which contains 1 ability and 1 weapon (if you win, you get a rare case and if you lose, you get a common case). Each case has a chance to get different rarity items. These rarities are common, rare, extraordinary and exotic. The higher the rarity, the better the item. Brag to others about your items and you can even trade.</p>
<p>You will be able to switch between flying camera, third person and first person. This allows you to be diverse in game preference.</p>
<p>All of this is ranked but you can also play on community servers or offline with bots. The bots can help you sharpen your skills with difficulty ranging from harmless to 1 hit kill.</p>
<p>And this is only the tip of the iceberg of all the features in the game.</p>

<h3>Rulers in Perdition </h3>
<p>An Epic Fantasy Based RPG where your choices truly impact the world, where those same choices shape multiple endings, where you impact the entire realm on a unique scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Russell King, a long time avid gamer, I went to college for graphic and web design and got a taste of programming in my current job. I've been playing RPG's since I was 5, and I've been hammering out this story for over 18 years as a dungeon master. My team is Sean Potter, Levi Johnson, September Garland, and Charles Jones. Sean helps with story, Levi is our music director, September does our conceptual art, and Charles is our unity expert. </li>
<li>As an avid gamer, I feel so many games get convoluted these days. I want to make RPG's that a player can jump into and enjoy. Some of my favorite games follow a strict formula but leave out exciting features. I want to hold the player responsible for their actions. If they are of a good alignment and commit a crime I want their character to feel the sting. I want them to make a fall from grace and perform a redeemer quest in order to return to their original alignment. You will be able to recruit people, and you will be driven towards an epic battle to decide the fate of the realm from the standpoint of your kingdom. I want your actions to determine how well prepared your side is for that epic battle, such as troop counts, strength of your enemies, even what special characters will take place in the fight. I'm also firm on using real people for every humanoid character in the game to develop an organic and unique feeling. We are designing an Epic RPG either way for both the PC and a prequel for mobile devices. We simply seek to expand our team and deliver this masterpiece to the you the consumer, faster and stronger than we could do with our current team.</li>
<li>By contributing to the game you will be creating a legacy of games that we aim to develop. Starting with this title. Every person in my team is passionate about games. We want to continue to make amazing games for gamers by gamers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We ask you to help us accomplish this dream, and to help us deliver exciting game mechanics wrapped into enthralling storylines, combined with beautifully crafted graphics. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need $500,000 to fully accomplish our dream involved in this project. We will be able to purchase additional assets from the unity store, upgrade our hardware, purchase the software we require to make top end graphics, and the more we receive the larger our team can become and the more time, resources, and skilled individuals we can dedicate to the project! At $500,000 the government will tax us at the highest tax bracket, my state will want a piece and then indiegogo wants a piece so instantly that's 54% of the funds raised spent. Afterwards we will hire a couple additional designers, and purchase assets from the Unity Asset store. </li>
<li>At our higher tier perks we are giving you a producer credit to be a part of this game, also at $150 you get a .pdf compendium of all the characters in the game who were modeled from real people, one side will be their character bio, the other side is who they really are, as well as an explanation of how we brought these people in-game. </li>
<li><strong>Regardless of how much capital we raise we will accomplish this game build, the only factor is the duration of time it will take to make, and with less money it will not have all of the features it deserves, but we will push it out, at 500,000 we will launch our PC version, anything below that we will start with a mobile prequel and then push the PC version out afterwards.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>What you are providing us with by choosing to donate to our project:</p>
<ul>
<li>The impact we plan to make on the gaming industry with our project is significant. We aim to make an Epic RPG that becomes a house hold name, spawning multiple genre defining sequels across multiple platforms. We also want it to be one that people enjoy playing again and again and eagerly anticipate a sequel or added content.</li>
<li>We will have a working version of our product by January 2019 at the latest, with a minimal goal of specific features. Ideally, we will have all features implemented by this time but we aim to be realistic, without the funding from the people who are reading this Rulers in Perdition will take a significant amount of time to develop properly especially for a one to two person coding team. If we can raise our capital and expand our team to multiple coding experts then we will be able to not only hit the January 2019 deadline, but we will be able to implement all the features we desire. If we hit any of our stretch goals we will be able to implement these features quicker and have a working product by mid-late 2018. When you have 140+ characters to render, and the massive environment as well as complex game mechanics being introduced to work cohesively together you find why this is an Epic, and not just an RPG as well as why it will take so long to complete the project from start to finish.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p><strong>- Combining multiple features from multiple genres</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Successfully creating the final battle between all five kingdoms</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Ensuring that the flying, riding, and sailing mechanics are fluid motions that are not choppy</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Making a successful building system for personal kingdom building *Stretch goal feature*</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Implementing the largest class system and character customization system ever made</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest portion of developing this game is we are tying together components that exist already in other major titles spanning multiple genres. We are not reinventing the wheel, we are simply adding the pieces that exist already to turn wood into rubber so to speak. With that being said, our challenge is being able to successfully tie these features together.</li>
<li>We will overcome the challenges above by reaching out to my own personal network of developers I’ve established over the years since college who have previously worked on games or in other programming fields. Another way is by finding solutions by utilizing unity assets. If solutions are not present we will rise to the challenge by creating solutions through writing our own assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask others in your personal network to view this campaign, get excited about it, tell people in your community about Rulers in Perdition, because everyone involved in the project from developer to model to voice actor is excited about it, we just hope you are too since we are developing this for you!</li>
<li>Don’t forget you can quickly share our campaign by using the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you kindly from the entire team we look forward to dazzling you with your masterpiece!!!</p>

<h3>Who am I, what do I do and what do I want?</h3>My name is Mark Starkey, and I am a video gamer of 26 years, experienced in working in the industry and a keen enthusiast of video game arcades. In 2011, I purchased a number of arcade machines from the closure of Londons biggest arcade, the legendary 'Funland' located within the Trocadero at Piccadilly Circus, and opened up The Heart of Gaming (affectionately known to its audience as 'HoG') in North Acton, London. It has been growing for years, and its now time to move the HoG to a better location with more facilities! <br/><br/>The purpose of this campaign is to raise the funds to enable us to move into and renovate the new property to meet and exceed the gamers expectations. We have found an ideal location, but work is needed. Your donations and contributions and support will be used  to accomplish this, so that the equipment can be moved in.  <p><br/><strong>Why Back My Project?</strong><br/><br/>The success of this project would be absolutely groundbreaking. Firstly, you will be helping to provide a heritage archive, a working museum and destination point for gamers of the past, present and future. We would be succeeding, as players, where the corporations ultimately failed us. In this, you would be showing the world what true underdogs are capable of. You will also ensure that the current players and generations to come will be able to experience the joy of an arcade in real life rather than through videos of the past.   </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The target amount is for £90,000. We already have 90% of the gaming equipment needed for the venue. Your money will be spent largely on the following expenses-<br/><br/>Venue rent deposit and initial upfront rent payment period.<br/>Additional new generation consoles, software and peripherals<br/>Installation of a lan set up and pc gaming area and casting booth. <br/>​Purchasing of additional media equipment such as display screens and projectors<br/>The purchase of furnishings for player comfort such as chairs, sofas and beanbags and shelves.<br/>A conference/ private hire room facility<br/>Installation of all utilities- Toilets, electrical lines, ethernet wiring, water, fire safety and internet.<br/>Full internal rennovation- flooring, cubicles, walls, shelves, platforms and a stage.<br/>A safety budget for initial outgoings.<br/>New equipment such as pool tables, air hockey, an intercom system and vending machines.<br/>Installation of counters, fittings for shop and cafe/ bar area.<br/>Implementation of a high quality website.<br/>Additional arcade machines and renovation of existing ones.<br/><br/><br/><strong>What will we provide in exchange for donations?</strong><br/>​<br/>We have created a number of perks for you to enjoy in exchange for backing our project, and hope that you will enjoy them and find a package that suits you. These perks include-<br/><br/>Nostalgia in the way of 'Funland' metal gaming tokens, the seeds of yesterdays arcade making way for the future growth of another!<br/><br/>Fashion in the way of t-shirts and hoodies. Feel comfortable, and show others you are part of the HoG community!<br/><br/>Recognition in the form of your name being engraved on a plaque to be displayed as long as the heart keeps beating!<br/><br/>Game time, in the way of purchasing various membership offers, with varying perks!  <br/><br/>Recognition, by having your name featured on a plaque to be permanently displayed in HoG for as long as the heart keeps beating.<br/><br/>And more benefits, such an invitations to our VIP and press launch party, and private hiring also! <br/><br/><strong>And if we don't reach our goal? </strong><br/><br/>The HoG will happen regardless. <br/><br/>If we fail badly- This simply means that we will have to take on investors, and its fair to say some have approached me seeking involvement on a financial level. Very and quite simply, I don't want this. I prefer the democracy that HoG operates as with its customer base, and would rather it remained as such. Nonetheless, it is an option should the donations not be satisfactory. <br/><br/>Remember, the crowning beauty of HoG is that it is community based, and powered by players.<br/><br/>If fall short- Should we do well enough but still fall short, then the HoG will do what it has always done, and that is to make use of what is available, and grow slowly but surely. Some ideas will be momentarily on hold, but will be achieved later down the progressive line. <br/><br/>Either way, the funds that people invest are going to the project. We are in a position to strike a massive notch into the history of destination gaming. Thought to be dead due to emulation and the rise of home consoles, we haven proven beyond doubt that the decline in arcades is down to the inability of the Old School operators to move with the times. Survive and adapt. This is what the HoG does. This is what you will be part of. Together we will all make history, as we welcome a new version of the 'Arcade' in the 21st century.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since the HoG was started, a number of smaller businesses across the UK have implemented gaming areas, as we have proven that people will travel for the right gaming set ups, but noone has bought the scene out in London like the Heart of Gaming, NOONE. We have caught the eyes of celebrities, from Bill Bailey to Dick and Dom. We have hosted 'first look' and location tests for new games. We have even played host to multiple educational visits from schools, colleges and universities. We even had a mural painted by two ladies following the death of Nintendo President Satori Iwata that not only went viral, by Nintendo of Japan personally sent a copy to his family. We have recovered from flooding, from robbery, and nothing has been able to hold us down. The HoG just continues to grow all the time, and with your help, it'll grow even bigger and better. With 4 years experience, the foundation is solid and growing. The eyes of the world are on US. Newspapers and media list us as 'the one to watch'. You're about to find out why. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Obstacles that we'll overcome</h3>
<p>There were some issues in the old building that we encountered on our journey, but we're older an wiser now, and steps have been taken to ensure previous obstacles will be a thing of the past. Experience is key to dealing with issues. Take a look at some of the improvements we've been able to recognise through experience.<br/><br/>High powered internet and wi-fi. This was a pain with no remedy before, making streaming events very frustrating. Our new unit does not have such issues.<br/><br/>Climate control. Before we were in a warehouse that trapped heat in the summer and cold in the winter. Now we're in a shopping center, these issues are gone.<br/><br/>Amazing travel links. The previous HoG had no night buses and was uncomfortable to reach due to no lighting in the alley way that involved players walking past a cemetery in pitch black. The new location is a minutes walk in a heavily populated and well lit area from the Central Line tube. This now runs 24 hours at the weekend. The Hammersmith and Circle Lines are also local. There are multiple night buses and two bus stations. There is an overground line stop too, and a car parking facility in a neighbouring shopping center. This issue is DEFINITELY sorted. </p>Local amenities. The old HoG had nothing but Asda and Tesco, meaning that meal time meant a long walk. Shepherds Bush has plenty of local meal options and shops mere seconds away from the HoG entrance. Were 10 seconds walk from Vue cinema!<p> </p>

<h3>Ruler of Kings Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings. I am <strong><a href=""http://www.jeanborde.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jean Borde</a></strong>, a web coder, writer, autism parent and old school dungeon master. I'm am fairly well known online. You can find me through our many sites but the one I am best known on is <a href=""http://www.internationaldiscussions.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">International Discussions</a>, even so you can also find me through <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Borde"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jeanborde"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, etc. As a web developer I am very familiar with scams out there. To verify any information is connected to the actual project, please ensure to use the WhoIS information connected with the domain (if you know what that is). Please contact me via <a href=""http://www.JeanBorde.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.JeanBorde.com</a> or <a href=""http://www.RulerOfKings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.RulerOfKings.com</a> from the contact button on those pages. I am usually timely with replies. Now, on to this campaign:</p>
<p>We've created a free medieval fantasy text RPG that is part of a wider international community of writers, debaters and of course role-players. We already run many play-by-post games there but I've found that the pace may be slow at times, however the opportunity to be descriptive is far greater than live tabletop.

<p>Ruler of Kings is a medieval fantasy text role-playing game that allows you to <strong>play at anytime without the need of a Dungeon Master or other players</strong>. It works based on a combination of custom codes, a compelling story, colorful non-player characters and your choices. It is very much like reading a medieval fantasy novel where you make the choice together with dice, and role-play!</p>
<p>The Ruler of Kings home page explains the game more in depth and there are some videos there that can help you get a better feel for it, however to truly understand Ruler of Kings you have to play it! There is nothing like it online because it combines the element of story building, character development, role-play, and strategy thus allowing you to always be in a medieval fantasy so long as you have access to a browser and the internet. I can also describe it like reading a medieval fantasy novel where you are the author and control the protagonist. Certain elements of the game can also be edited or updated by players, For instance, if you do not like how a place in the town is described you can submit an improvement or alternate description.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As an autism parent I've seen how role-playing games can help many on the spectrum to express themselves (see this <strong><a href=""http://www.bordeglobal.com/foruminv/index.php?showtopic=322640"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">article</a></strong> I wrote) but this isn't about autism per se as all kinds of people play Ruler of Kings and other RPGs at our site. I am just mentioning it because many have social challenges that can benefit from an outlet to express themselves. We've decided to start a funding campaign to expand the game. At present, there are two medieval towns, many assignments and 3 specific quests that can be played at anytime. Since this engages a lot of time and expertise I need a source of income to keep me going, hence this campaign. Contributions will also help pay for servers, domains, video creation, images, more expert input into the content, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Contribution</h3>
<p>When you chose to back this project you are helping many medieval fantasy lovers to have an outlet available 24/7 to get into a world that encourages writing, reading, role-play and strategy. Ruler of Kings runs in conjunction with a community (existing for over 16+ years) that caters for constructive input free from spam, trolls and haters in general. This means it is a safe place to play because it is well moderated, in fact, many stages of the game require approval at first to ensure those coming to play have an intent to be a genuine participant.</p>
<p>Your contribution will specifically aide in expanding these parts of the game:</p>
<p>1. The introduction of armies, battle map and player army battles</p>
<p>2. The introduction of clans among players</p>
<p>3. The introduction of a familiar with his/her own role-play</p>
<p>4. The introduction of more quests, especially a major quest with the typical elements of a tabletop game as part of the exploration.</p>
<p>5. Expansion into two other towns.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Challenges</h3>
<p>Do note... Ruler of Kings at <a href=""http://www.rulerofkings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RulerOfKings.com</a> is an ongoing project and ever growing. I have to home school two of my boys on the spectrum and look for an income at the same time - a formidable task while coding Ruler of Kings and maintaining the community it runs on. Your contributions will enable me to dedicate more time to it as I will not have to worry as much about income for the period of the expansions listed. If for some reason the campaign amount is not met we will still use what is made towards the expansion of Ruler of Kings as it is already running and being played by many.</p>

<p>Hello! Salangan Games team presents you our project - Zeliria Sanctuary visual novel.</p>
<p>We started creating our game in July 2017; originally it was planned only in Russian, as we just wanted to make a small unpretentious visual novel. But when we released a demo version, we found out that our game was interesting for many people; and questions about release in Steam forced us to think about the future of the project.</p>
<p>The interest of our Russian-speaking players made us review our plans and not only make the game in two languages ​​- Russian and English, but also significantly expand it.</p>
<p>To implement all that, we need much more finances than we planned, so we decided to start this fund-raising campaign.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>To be an elite fighter of special forces is cool! Strength, dexterity, popularity with the opposite sex, and loyal friends – all this our Maxx has in abundance. Combat missions are difficult, but they give enough thrills to feel your life in all its glory!<br/> <br/>Alas, even such a dynamic life bores with time; and the colors begin to fade. But where can a special forces soldier who passed through hell and high water find new sensations? Where no one else was before! Become the first in something, even if it will be a suicidal experiment to test the world’s first teleport!<br/> <br/>What? The chance to survive is 13%? It’ll do!<br/> <br/>It would be too easy and stupid to die for Maxx, but life obviously loves him. But he also could not just go down in history, having completed the experiment successfully… He’d rather get into a mess.<br/> <br/>Maxx took just one step, one small step for a man, but it forever separated the past from the future, divided his life into BEFORE and AFTER, to Earth and “Hell, where am I?!”. But isn’t it what he was looking for? Or was it not the personal motives and desires that hid behind the bravado of the young fighter?<br/> <br/>It is impossible to go back, past achievements and merits no longer matter, now there is only one way forward.

<p>Since our game is full of humor and sarcasm (Humkey is the biggest sarcasm lover), it is very important that the color of the speech of our Salangan is not lost in translation. Therefore, for a quality literary translation of the game, we will need professional translators; a significant part of the funds will be spent on their services.</p>
<p>The main goal of our collection is not so great - only 1800 USD, this amount will be enough for us to add several animation elements to the game and to ensure the quality translation of the game into English.<br/>The rest funds will be aimed at improving the game graphics - increasing the number of transitional scenes for dynamic moments of the game, adding animation to backgrounds and sprites, as well as final arts of the game in a realistic style.</p>
<p>We will certainly release our game even if the fund raising is unsuccessful. But we do need your support to make it better. </p>

<p>We dream to make an OST intro. This small fragment creates that initial mood needed for player to plunge into the new world. Just two or three minutes, but to make them at the level corresponding to the rest of the content, we need to record a song in English and make animation.</p>
<p>All $8 and $200 funds will be spent for translation into Japanese. To release the game in Japanese at the same time as the English one, we need $ 10,000. If this amount is not collected, we will release the Japanese version later (as the game is sold). Nevertheless, even a partial amount will speed up the translation of the project.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Set in the nineties, USSR, ""Seven Summer days"" is a set of five visual novels combining loss, passion, anger and mystery. Noir story is the first game from series. After it there will be plot bridges: a loss story, a passion story and an anger story. And Road Demon/Demiurge-trio finishes it as a big epilogue of Close Realms Universe.</p>
<p>Each game features about 20 hours of gameplay with a total non-linear scenario and multiple endings. Six heroines, with a meeting of two of them in the Noir story. </p>
<p>I'm working in GMS2 so porting game to another gaming platforms is only matter of money (and buying extended license). So in case of success there will be simultaneous release in any possible PC/mobile device. In case of even greater succes I can create web-version of game.</p>
<p>7sd will contain more than 120 hours of gameplay in its script, over 50 backgrounds, and 3+ hours of music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I already have fully working demo so you are able to check future game via downloading/playing the demo and decide whether you support me or not. Probably you just hate visual novel, you know.</p>
<p>So what I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprites or heroines models.There are SIX main heroines (Maria, Lera, Stasya, Lana, Sasha, Yana) and I have only one of them.  It costs money. I'm working with a great artist so there are no doubts about future sprite quality.</li>
<li>Music or soundtrack. Speaks for itself. Good music costs money. And yeah, I'm working with yet another great artist. You can check his music in the demo.</li>
<li>License! Well, it costs about $400 to port my game to all your devices. </li>
<li>Translation. Well I'm writing in russian so I need someone who's good enough to translate my text. And he will be paid for his work.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556362109/ngcg6awyoakmffkadprh.png"" src=""""/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Let me make some loud noises... FROM THE CREATOR OF NUMBER ONE EVERLASTING SUMMER'S MODIFICATION!!! Come on. It's just a mod. People reading it do love it and want me to continue writing this mod.

Set in the nineties, USSR, ""Seven Summer days"" is a set of five visual novels combining loss, passion, anger and mystery. Noir story is the first game from series. After it there will be plot bridges: a loss story, a passion story and an anger story. And Road Demon/Demiurge-trio finishes it as a big epilogue of Close Realms Universe.
Each game features about 20 hours of gameplay with a total non-linear scenario and multiple endings. Six heroines, with a meeting of two of them in the Noir story. 
I'm working in GMS2 so porting game to another gaming platforms is only matter of money (and buying extended license). So in case of success there will be simultaneous release in any possible PC/mobile device. In case of even greater succes I can create web-version of game.
7sd will contain more than 120 hours of gameplay in its script, over 50 backgrounds, and 3+ hours of music.

What I Need & What You Get
I already have fully working demo so you are able to check future game via downloading/playing the demo and decide whether you support me or not. Probably you just hate visual novel, you know.
So what I need:

Sprites or heroines models.There are SIX main heroines (Maria, Lera, Stasya, Lana, Sasha, Yana) and I have only one of them.  It costs money. I'm working with a great artist so there are no doubts about future sprite quality.
Music or soundtrack. Speaks for itself. Good music costs money. And yeah, I'm working with yet another great artist. You can check his music in the demo.
License! Well, it costs about $400 to port my game to all your devices. 
Translation. Well I'm writing in russian so I need someone who's good enough to translate my text. And he will be paid for his work.



The Impact
Let me make some loud noises... FROM THE CREATOR OF NUMBER ONE EVERLASTING SUMMER'S MODIFICATION!!! Come on. It's just a mod. People reading it do love it and want me to continue writing this mod. But instead of it I'm going to convert this mod to the separate game (is coming after my work at D3|RD will be finished). 
So here's the roadlist:
1. Noir prequel game.
2. Bridge one (loss story) - a story with two routes with Lana and Maria (a boat trip and a train trip). This will be a first connection between original 7dl story and an actual Road Demon scenario.
3. Bridge two (passion story) - story with Stasya and Lera.
3. Bridge three(anger story) - story with Yana and Sasha.
4. Road Demon/Demiurge-trio - main story with all six heroines.
5. 7dl conversion project - converting my already extisting universe into the separate game (its about 100 hours of gameplay. No kidding!)
6. A book may be created, if the idea finds some response.
 
My stories are about people. About their relationships and their fate leading into the surprisingly interesting endings.  You could find some warmth and hope if you need it. Or just dive deep into a grim atmosphere of my noir story.  Just try clicking some buttons. There are three parts of stories: Lana's ending from the conversion, Dem prologue from Road Demon|Demiurge-trui and Noir as demo exclusive.
BTW, you've got two numbers ""3"". For your info.

Risks & Challenges
Well, the most risk is all mine. Since I've already got in here. I'll be working on my universe no matter of gaining the goal or not. It will be just... slower. The most expensive of course is the music and the heroines' visual. But I will got it as well one way or another. So supporting me you're just speeding up the process.
And yeah, go check out my demo please. 
You can get it here on google.drive. Enjoy reading!

</div></div>","We are team of six people. We have the will, knowledge and most importantly the passion to see this project to the end. What we do lack, is funding to expand our numbers with a team of 3D Modelers and animators, and with some more server programmers and Unity3D developers, who will help us finish the project by the end of this year. And that's where You guys come in play. However, if we fail to gather required funds via crowdfunding, we certainly won't be giving up on this. Completing Heroes of Asgard is our dream, and you just do not give up on your dreams that easily! Heroes of Asgard will be an old-school MMORPG with new ideas and modern execution, based upon the gameplay of Metin2, and is due to release in late 2015.Ascalon, land of the rich and prosperous. Long ago, the Ascalonians have learned the life of trading. Prosperity has gradually transformed the area into a marketplace where traders from other kingdoms gathered to display their most precious treasures with a bid to find buyers or to trade for other exotic item.Talos, a strong and mighty kingdom who fought bravely against the titans, where names of those legendary heroes are now recorded in the book of Asgard. Talos is the birthplace of great heroes. The Talosian are proud of their ancestors and train hard each day with an aim to continue the legacy and be remembered forever.Midas, land of mystery, surrounded by a world of wilderness. Legend has it that the senior Gods constructed a magical wall in this land to prevent demons from invading. The Midasians believe that there is something magical hidden beneath the land which is why the demons have been trying to take over the area for themselves.Combat is based on Hack & Slash system, the player hits the space key each time he or she wishes the character to strike, or just keep holding the button to complete the combo!Every Class has 6 different skills, divided by attack skills and buffs. Buffs skills can be applied on self or for all. Every skill has 4 different grades and at each grade the animation is enhanced.Skill starts at the non-master level. After a fixed amount of skill points, the skill advance to Master Level. At this stage the skill can only advance by reading books. Books can be found from Arks or special box and can only be read once a day. At every level, the amount of books needed to complete is increased till it reaches the Grand Master level. The last grade is known as the Perfect Master which needs some rare stones to achieve.There are also several passive skills that are common in all Class and sub class. They can just be leveled up with special books and they help the players in different ways, like raising some status or boosting special abilities.PVP system is various and can be triggered in any map. A player can attack other player from a different nation without restriction as they are no different from the monsters. They can also attack player from the same nation using the Free Mode (although it doesn't come without a cost) or he can press the ""Duel"" button and start a normal 1 versus 1 against a co-national. PVP is also triggered on the external maps when 2 or more players claim the same Ark or the same Boss. Usually these situations escalate quickly and friends of both parties approach immediately to aid their friends causing a big war that may continue even after the object of the dispute is long gone. It is also common to attack the Town of a nation with a small or larger group of players and this particular PVP is called raid.Apart from the common PVP, the game offers different kind of PVP.Once a week, each kingdom fights for the glory of their Kingdom known as the Kingdom War. All 3 kingdoms fight each other in a 2 round match on an event map. During the first round, kingdom with less point will be sent back home while on the second round the kingdoms with more points is the winner.To ensure greater success during game development, the founders and their team members have agreed to go with crowd funding through Indiegogo to raise sufficient fund for the purpose of hiring more graphical staff and server programmers.

<p>Space Chronicles is a free-to-play MMORPG you can play in your browser. You are a space pilot in one of the two races of the game universe, fighting a bloody war to control the Deutanio, the most rare and precious material in the universe. Gather resources, fight the enemy, join factions to reach common objectives, explore and much more! Write the chronicles of the universe!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433150931/hoauqc7elb7ohdrzsbaj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>
<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Brief Gameplay Introduction</span><br/>
</h3>
<div> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>If you ever played games like DarkOrbit, this game will be familiar in its basic gameplay.</p>
<p>You start by selecting your race. Then you obtain a basic spaceship, some weapons and ammo that you can upgrade with credits, aurum, resources and by rising your exp level.</p>
<p><b>Races</b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">The game universe is dominated by two races: The Humans and the Ruykons. There is also present a third race non playable called 'Insectoid', biomachines with survival as their unique objective.</p> </div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432568100/kp9gvmcytlyoazwjrtyz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<br/><b>Deutanio</b>
</div><div>
<p>The 'Deutanio' is the most rare and precious resource in the universe. It is the only material that can be used to produce the 'Energhon'. The 'Energhon' makes up the energy used for everything in the universe, from spaceships engines to weapons, defense shields, warp jumping and much more.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432568159/xys0dqdkls5t5n3yuqvh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Resources</b></p>
<p>Because the 'Deutanio' is so very rare in the galaxy, the two races have engaged in research to find methods to synthetize it. The process isn't easy or cheap and introduces the concept of 'material crafting'. In the universe there are six main resources:</p>
<p>Beuranio, Palonite, Talonite, Teutranio, Detraxite and Deutanio</p>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</b><p><b style=""background-color: initial;""></b>The 'Beuranio', 'Palonite' and 'Talonite' are the most common resources in the galaxy. You can find them in asteroids, salvage box, insectoid and other places.</p>
<p>It's possible to combine the Beuranio and the Talonite to synthetize the Teutranio and combine the Palonite and the Talonite to synthetize the Detraxite. By combining the Teutranio and the Detraxite you can finally synthetize the Deutanio! Confused? I told you it wasn't easy!</p>
<p>And yes, you lose some resources along the way. I also told you it's not cheap!</p>
<p>Obviously you can also buy the already synthetized resources on the galatic market so that option is up to you!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Credits and Aurum</b></p>
<div>
<p>The Credits are the main currency of the game. It can be found in the salvage boxes, in the insectoid and obviously yes, it can be looted from the other dead players.</p>
<p>The Aurum is a premium currency of the game, you can think of it as gold. You can get Aurum monthly if you pay for a Premium Account or buy it from our upcoming store. It can also be found in little quantity within the game to allow the free users to obtain the most powerful equipment, but obviously more slowly!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Spaceships and Weapons</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432568259/ayw7ukwufh2nxvn4vimo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>The spaceship is your ""avatar"" in the game. The Hull defines your hitpoints, your speed and the max number of resources player can load aboard. You can upgrade your ship and also buy new hulls to make it more powerful. But you can only use one ship at time, you can't build a fleet.</p>
<p>The weapons available are currently of three main types:</p>
<p>Laser Cannons, Missiles and Mines.</p>
<p>Every weapons can be loaded with different Ammo Types.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Every ammo types has a basic damage and unique effects, but the number of weapons multiply the damage of the Ammos. I'll give you an example:</span></p>
<p>you have 2 laser ammo type on board, the 200 damage type and the 400 damage type.</p>
<p>You have 2 laser cannons. So your basic damage will be 200 x 2 for the first type of ammo and 400 x 2 for the second type. </p>
<p>This is a basic rule, but there are other things influencing the damage, like the experience level or the droids.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Factions</b></p>
<p>It will possible to create Factions (or Clans) to cooperatively pursue common  objectives to complete quests, events, and super special events!</p>
<p><b>And more...</b></p>
<p>This is only a brief introduction of the Space Chronicles galaxy.</p>
<p>It is a universe continuously evolving, one where your actions will have consequences, directing and developing the game's story!</p>
<p>Without getting in depth into the gameplay (that would be a very long reading for this page) you should know that there are an incredible amount of features you can further read on our website, our facebook page or our twitter account. We will upload a full gameplay guide on our website in the coming weeks, but be patient: it's long to read but also to write!</p>

<h3>Other ways to help us</h3>
<div><p>We appreciate any way in which will be able to help us achieve our funding. If you are unable to contribute
financially to our campaign, please share the page with your network!</p></div>
<div><h3>Risks &amp; Challanges</h3></div>
<div>
<p>Financial
instability is our main challenge: we face the risk of running out of cash.
As we are a small team, it takes longer to complete the project; however it is easier to control our budget that way. Even though we are a small team, the
experience and background of each member has made the team diverse with
creative/design and business/finance expertise. We are constantly analyzing the status of
the game and comparing it to our budget to ensure we have enough money.</p>
<p><b>If this campaign does
not get funded, we'll be doing flexible funding so that backers can still get their
rewards, and so we can still improve the game.</b></p>

Space Chronicles is a free-to-play MMORPG you can play in your browser. You are a space pilot in one of the two races of the game universe, fighting a bloody war to control the Deutanio, the most rare and precious material in the universe. Gather resources, fight the enemy, join factions to reach common objectives, explore and much more! Write the chronicles of the universe!

Brief Gameplay Introduction

 
If you ever played games like DarkOrbit, this game will be familiar in its basic gameplay.
You start by selecting your race. Then you obtain a basic spaceship, some weapons and ammo that you can upgrade with credits, aurum, resources and by rising your exp level.
Races
The game universe is dominated by two races: The Humans and the Ruykons. There is also present a third race non playable called 'Insectoid', biomachines with survival as their unique objective. 


Deutanio

The 'Deutanio' is the most rare and precious resource in the universe. It is the only material that can be used to produce the 'Energhon'. The 'Energhon' makes up the energy used for everything in the universe, from spaceships engines to weapons, defense shields, warp jumping and much more.




Resources
Because the 'Deutanio' is so very rare in the galaxy, the two races have engaged in research to find methods to synthetize it. The process isn't easy or cheap and introduces the concept of 'material crafting'. In the universe there are six main resources:
Beuranio, Palonite, Talonite, Teutranio, Detraxite and Deutanio

The 'Beuranio', 'Palonite' and 'Talonite' are the most common resources in the galaxy. You can find them in asteroids, salvage box, insectoid and other places.
It's possible to combine the Beuranio and the Talonite to synthetize the Teutranio and combine the Palonite and the Talonite to synthetize the Detraxite. By combining the Teutranio and the Detraxite you can finally synthetize the Deutanio! Confused? I told you it wasn't easy!
And yes, you lose some resources along the way. I also told you it's not cheap!
Obviously you can also buy the already synthetized resources on the galatic market so that option is up to you!

Credits and Aurum

The Credits are the main currency of the game. It can be found in the salvage boxes, in the insectoid and obviously yes, it can be looted from the other dead players.
The Aurum is a premium currency of the game, you can think of it as gold. You can get Aurum monthly if you pay for a Premium Account or buy it from our upcoming store. It can also be found in little quantity within the game to allow the free users to obtain the most powerful equipment, but obviously more slowly!

Spaceships and Weapons



The spaceship is your ""avatar"" in the game. The Hull defines your hitpoints, your speed and the max number of resources player can load aboard. You can upgrade your ship and also buy new hulls to make it more powerful. But you can only use one ship at time, you can't build a fleet.
The weapons available are currently of three main types:
Laser Cannons, Missiles and Mines.
Every weapons can be loaded with different Ammo Types.
Every ammo types has a basic damage and unique effects, but the number of weapons multiply the damage of the Ammos. I'll give you an example:
you have 2 laser ammo type on board, the 200 damage type and the 400 damage type.
You have 2 laser cannons. So your basic damage will be 200 x 2 for the first type of ammo and 400 x 2 for the second type. 
This is a basic rule, but there are other things influencing the damage, like the experience level or the droids.

Factions
It will possible to create Factions (or Clans) to cooperatively pursue common  objectives to complete quests, events, and super special events!
And more...
This is only a brief introduction of the Space Chronicles galaxy.
It is a universe continuously evolving, one where your actions will have consequences, directing and developing the game's story!
Without getting in depth into the gameplay (that would be a very long reading for this page) you should know that there are an incredible amount of features you can further read on our website, our facebook page or our twitter account. We will upload a full gameplay guide on our website in the coming weeks, but be patient: it's long to read but also to write!

Hey, why do you want my money anyway?

 
Space Chronicles is a project that has requested a big investment to reach this prototype  stage. Currently the project is approaching the alpha phase but we have got many ideas that we want to reasearch & develop. That's why we need your help and support!
The money that we'll get from this fundraising will only be used to fund the game development, to acquire new assets and software licenses, and to hire new developers. The main objective is clear: to get the most entertaining and addictive game possible!

Other ways to help us
We appreciate any way in which will be able to help us achieve our funding. If you are unable to contribute
financially to our campaign, please share the page with your network!
Risks & Challanges

Financial
instability is our main challenge: we face the risk of running out of cash.
As we are a small team, it takes longer to complete the project; however it is easier to control our budget that way. Even though we are a small team, the
experience and background of each member has made the team diverse with
creative/design and business/finance expertise. We are constantly analyzing the status of
the game and comparing it to our budget to ensure we have enough money.
If this campaign does
not get funded, we'll be doing flexible funding so that backers can still get their
rewards, and so we can still improve the game.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Custom Models</b><br/>(3D model creation can be costly depending on the model, I personally have not practiced enough to be proficient in making my own 3D models which is why I have Mauri on the team to cover that aspect of development. Models can range from $50 for a clothing/accessory piece to $300+ for a character, structure or anything that requires a long creation time or great detail). </li></ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul><li>
<b>Purchase Assets</b><br/>(If you read the ""Game Engine"" section above you now know I am using the Unity Engine which has a store called the ""Asset Store"", since I am one person I go there to purchase things that I cannot make on my own. Things like scripting assets that help with culling, processing, handling of models, visual effects, shaders, real time reflections, etc. <br/><br/>Asset prices can range from $10 to $150 or more depending on what the asset does, how long it's been around and what changes have been made to it's recent updates). </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Soundtrack</b><br/>(The soundtrack for KSA as of now consists of mostly all royalty free music in order to minimize costs at the beginning of production, I find that having custom music tracks really helps solidify singularity and remembrance over time with gamers and devs. alike. I would like to have custom tracks replace the already present royalty free music and also new tracks for the upcoming levels/playable areas).</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Marketing</b><br/>(Word of mouth can be a powerful marketing tool but another powerful way to get your game known is paid advertisment, I plan to utilize paid ads with well known websites, radio commercials, convention booths, fliers, merchandise, etc. <br/><br/>I do plan on attending conventions in the near future in order to showcase KSA and offer merchandise that people can enjoy, keep or share with friends in order to spread the word and remember the game for a long time to come).<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Unity Pro License Fee - $1,500</b><br/>(In order to fully utilize Unity to it's fullest potential the pro version purchase is necessary, currently I do a monthly subscription but with the funds from this campaign I plan to purchase it flat out for an entire year. Covering all costs for the engine use and ensuring an entirely legal release).</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Production Time/Living Costs</b><br/>(Production of KSA not only requires costs for things to put into the game itself but also for the game developers survival. A portion of the money raised will go towards living costs in order to solidify a stable living situation so focus on the game can be a top priority. <br/><br/>As I mentioned in the beginning of this fundraiser I have paid for the production of KSA from money I earned working at corporate jobs and doing independent client work. This approach worked for a while but as 10 months has passed the game is nowhere near where I wish it to be, I feel within that time I could have accomplished a lot more if I had only the time and money to just focus on the game itself. <br/><br/>A portion of the raised funds will help solidify that living space and help the progress of KSA increase dramatically, pushing the overall production time and final release date a lot earlier then if I continued to work on the game only in my spare time.<br/><br/>This does not mean I will be buying a house or renting out a work studio to work out of, this merely means it will cover my rent and food costs so my main focus can be to finish KSA).</li></ul>

<p>The reason I decided to go with Indiegogo instead of Kickstarter is simple, the flexible funding option, at this point in development I have put quiet a lot of time and money into the production of the game. As a solo developer who <b>self funds</b> all of my projects I generally try my best not to ask for funding from others unless it is entirely necessary, at this point I feel it is necessary to get support from the fans and potential fans of the game in order to complete Kitten Super Adventure. <br/><br/>So I have come on Indiegogo asking for support!</p>

</div></div>","Kitten Super Adventure is a game where you play as a kitten and explore tons of worlds, your mission is to collect the stolen catnip bags and bring them back to Cat Islands, only then can you save your kitten companions and stop the islands from sinking!The evil Dr. Tricksies who was banished to an isolated island because of his crazy experiments finally got his revenge on the rest of the kittens by stealing all the catnip bags. Will he stop there? No his plans are much more diabolical then that, Dr. Tricksies and the minions he has gathered plan to sink the islands, drown all the kittens and build a floating castle where Cat Islands once was.  Who can save Cat Islands and the kittens who live there? Only one kitten can, that is you! 


Over a year ago I presented a small tech demo in a video to see how people would respond to a game where you play as a kitten, since then a lot of people have come to love Kitten Super Adventure!


Gameplay for Kitten Super Adventure will resemble similar gameplay to that of Spyro The Dragon, what I mean by this is in Spyro there were the base areas for the level and then inside of that level, numerous portals to other playable areas. Kitten Super Adventure will resemble similar gameplay but instead of diamonds being collected, you will be collecting catnip bags and have puzzles to solve.


You can collect catnip bags from enemies, find treasure chests, solve puzzles, complete missions and much more!

The game itself still has a ways to go before it is actually finished and various gameplay elements have yet to be implemented but there is definitely a plan.







Features that will be present in Kitten Super Adventure are as follows:
- Rich Storyline(The story will follow as explained above).





- Large Explorable Worlds(The size of each level will vary and present different obstacles/tasks to complete).


- Interactable Objects, NPC's, Etc.(Some object will be around just for fun while others will be main keys to progressing further in the game or opening portals to the other playable areas). 


- Puzzles(Puzzles can vary from ""Activate the buttons"" to getting through multiple areas with move able objects that need to be in a certain patter. Puzzles will change with the levels.). 

- Ability To Customize Your Kitten(Customize your kittens body structure, clothing, accessories and more!Some levels in story mode may remove your clothing/accessories and replace them with ones that fit the story, please keep this in mind and remember to save your customized kitten setups). 

Customization Test:

The functionality to customize the kittens body structure is in place but has not been fully implemented into the UI for players as of yet, here is a demonstration video showing what could be done in the game in the near future. 
This is a small demonstration and does not represent the final version that will be available for body customization. 


- Save Customization For Later Use(You can save a bunch of different customized kitten setups to be used at any point in time during free roam or story mode).
- Varying Mechanics(The base mechanics for movement and interaction will always stay the same but depending on the level there may be an extra mechanic or even a few extra mechanics that can be utilized such as using a hoverbike, riding a skateboard, using a jetpack, etc.). 



- Multiplayer(This is a feature that is still in the experimental stage and is planned to be in the final version, where you can enjoy being a kitten with other players, show off your customized kitten, have races, contests, you name it!)


- Alternate Titles

(As an extra bonus for completing certain missions and tasks you can unlock special title scenes or mini games.)







For various reasons we decided to not offer physical rewards as it ends up taking a huge chunk out of the raised funds, what we can offer is digital content that is only available to backers.
Below you will find the perk information, each tier comes with previous tier rewards (Ex: Purchase the $100 tier and receive rewards for that tier and any prior tier)



  
 I am sure for many of you one of the first questions that will arise is ""What is the money going to be used for?"" Let's go over that shall we:


Custom Models(3D model creation can be costly depending on the model, I personally have not practiced enough to be proficient in making my own 3D models which is why I have Mauri on the team to cover that aspect of development.

Kitten Super Adventure has a very small team dedicated to the production of the game, I personally handle 90% of the workload alone while the other 10% that can be attributed to 3D modeling is handled by one other person. Team Members:

Being a solo developer there are always challenges to overcome, the biggest is marketing and the next thing to follow is optimization. 
MarketingA small portion of the funds will go towards marketing the game before and after early access release on steam, being on steam does not always mean your game will be successful so it is up to us, the developers, to give it that little extra nudge.
While word of mouth has proven to be very powerful, a nice jump start on well known websites and other platforms using their paid marketing services can help to get that word of mouth expanding beyond the point it is at right now. 
Once the game has reached a certain point I will begin offering press kits and a press version of the game that will be sent out to newspapers, magazines, YouTubers and many other places that offer exposure for games.OptimizationWhile the game is meant to be quiet large and immersive the challenge lies in optimizing the game in order to function on most peoples computer,high or low end. The best solution I have come up with for this is LOD's (Load On Demand/Level of Detail) and depth of field culling, both have significantly lighten the load of each level I have implemented those systems into. I have presented this a few times over the course of development on the games facebook page, providing screenshots displaying changes in Tri Count and Draw Calls.

Another option I am looking into is world streaming, it's something I plan to learn more about in the near future as it seems very promising for optimization. 

Lack of Funds?
Even if the fundraiser is not successful whatever funds that has been raised will be put towards the production of the game, I definitely plan on finishing the game either way as I am not one to give up on anything that easily. Funds will help the production time decrease and allow complete focus on this game, without the funds I will have to work on it only in my spare time and gather funds from my paid work to put towards custom models and the other expenses.





If you have read this far you are awesome! Thank you so much for taking an interest in Kitten Super Adventure, the development of this game means a lot to me and hopefully my passion is apparent ^_^ 


As a solo developer the process is not always easy but anything is possible and with your support I can make this dream into a reality, I have even considered a VR possibility in the future which I think a lot of people will enjoy. 

A big inspiration for making this game was a huge desire to be a kitten, I am sure a lot of us have had this feeling at one point or another hehe to be a kitten and lounge around or go on secret missions where only a kitten could go! The adventures of a kitten must be so thrilling :D 

Once again thank you so much for any sort of support you have shown!

</div>
<p>The game is created for all Pinball &amp; Weed enthusiasts. The game will offer a Single-player with an intuitive game play story in which you fight to collect as many points as possible so you can grow more weed on your farm. </p>
<p>The game will also offer multiplayer to play against other stoners like yourself for different monthly and weekly prizes.</p>
<p>You will be surprised over and over again while playing Weed Pinball and you will laugh your head off while doing it!</p>

<p>In the Single-player you will go deep into the story-line to meet every crazy character that is shown in the game.

<h4>Mini Games</h4>
<p>To immerse you even more into this game in-between each level you will have special mini games which are used to create the changing environment for extra fun, but don't worry they also serve a purpose to the whole game as for example; before starting your first level you have to fly The Weed Voyager through space to collect as many stoner accessorize and avoid the police badges as they create minus points. The point to this is that as more points you obtain the more Pinball balls you will receive when your playing a level. For each new level you will have a new mini game which will keep you feeling satisfied and wanting to play more.</p>

<p>The Multiplayer is the most fun part of our game. When playing multiplayer you can choose to play online or offline. While playing offline, you can play it on different devices or on the same device, for example on a tablet where each side of the tablet the user has his own controls.</p>

<p>Weed Pinball multiplayer is full of surprises and tricks with which you can win and disable your opponent. From switching their controls from left to right, to getting number of different power-ups. In addition to this, if you want to make the game harder for your opponent you can also hit the frog with your ball and cause it to drop bombs and shorten the two joints that the opponent has as his controls, but be careful, the same can happen to you. </p>
<p>While competing online you will be able to compete in a friendly match ladder or in a competitive match ladder for which you will need to submit the plants you earned in to enter the competition. For each victory you will gain your opponents weed plant and there will also be monthly and weekly prizes for first three places on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>You will also be able to brag about your victory on Facebook and show your friends who the real Weed Master is!</p>
<p>For Multiplayer we currently have one Map for Offline and Online. In the future we will add more Maps to keep the game changing and more fun!</p>

<p>The reason why we chose crowdfunding is because we need your help! <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have already invested</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> over 30,000$ for copyright, software, hardware and other costs which are only related to production of the game. Now we need your help to help us finish the game with better quality and deliver it to you our supporter as fast as possible.</span></p>
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>To be able to create the game as good as possible and most important to be able to buy servers on which we would host our game on. Currently we are unable to implement the online Multiplayer as we need servers for that. With these servers we would cover all the platforms and unify them so that a person who owns Android can play against an iPhone user or even against Mac Os or Windows. In the future we would implement it with PS4, PS3, PSVita and Xbox One.</p>
<p></p>

<p>With your donation we would also be able to concentrate our full time towards Weed Pinball. You would give us an ability to finish the game much earlier and to implement other features into the game that all you gamers will love; from new levels to new mini games and different online competitions.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Forget everything You know about classical pinball! After a long period of time, pinball has evolved to Weed Pinball!







Weed Pinball will be published on several platforms. Firstly on Android and iOS mobile devices then later on Windows (Steam), Linux & Mac OS. Finally the game will be published on PS4, PS3 and Xbox One.
Weed Pinball is an action-arcade with ultra sharp and fluid 2D graphics, realistic physics and extraterrestrial music which wont leave you indifferent.

The game is created for all Pinball & Weed enthusiasts. The game will offer a Single-player with an intuitive game play story in which you fight to collect as many points as possible so you can grow more weed on your farm. 
The game will also offer multiplayer to play against other stoners like yourself for different monthly and weekly prizes.
You will be surprised over and over again while playing Weed Pinball and you will laugh your head off while doing it!



In the Single-player you will go deep into the story-line to meet every crazy character that is shown in the game. Each in-game character will give you a new awesome experience, but watch out because the  game also has bad guys which try to stop you in your mission to collect and grow as much weed as possible.
The first Two levels which have been finished:








Level Nirvana 2 is still in production, but above are some pictures of what we've done with it till now so you can see our progress! 

Mini Games
To immerse you even more into this game in-between each level you will have special mini games which are used to create the changing environment for extra fun, but don't worry they also serve a purpose to the whole game as for example; before starting your first level you have to fly The Weed Voyager through space to collect as many stoner accessorize and avoid the police badges as they create minus points. The point to this is that as more points you obtain the more Pinball balls you will receive when your playing a level. For each new level you will have a new mini game which will keep you feeling satisfied and wanting to play more.
The Weed Voyager  


The Fight for Weed




Bricks




The Multiplayer is the most fun part of our game. When playing multiplayer you can choose to play online or offline. While playing offline, you can play it on different devices or on the same device, for example on a tablet where each side of the tablet the user has his own controls.

Weed Pinball multiplayer is full of surprises and tricks with which you can win and disable your opponent. From switching their controls from left to right, to getting number of different power-ups. In addition to this, if you want to make the game harder for your opponent you can also hit the frog with your ball and cause it to drop bombs and shorten the two joints that the opponent has as his controls, but be careful, the same can happen to you. 
While competing online you will be able to compete in a friendly match ladder or in a competitive match ladder for which you will need to submit the plants you earned in to enter the competition. For each victory you will gain your opponents weed plant and there will also be monthly and weekly prizes for first three places on the scoreboard.
You will also be able to brag about your victory on Facebook and show your friends who the real Weed Master is!
For Multiplayer we currently have one Map for Offline and Online. In the future we will add more Maps to keep the game changing and more fun!






In Game Characters


Marry Huan

This being is not a male as everyone thinks. It lives in a very distant galaxy, where the main ingredient for life is THC. It is not aware in which troubles it will fall into when it comes to visit other galaxies.

Baja
As an escaped prisoner, he is trying to start a new business as a weed dealer. In the absence of weed on his home planet, he is trying to get the goods in other solar systems.

Angel Bob
Although hes not a real angel, Bob likes to present himself as an angel. He currently lives in his kingdom called ""Nirvana"" and is known as the guardian of weed and is very stingy when it comes to sharing the weed.

Coco

The dragon which had a hard childhood. After his parents sold him for a kilo of cocaine to some dealers. Angel Bob saved him from those dealers. Today, they are best friends and whenever Angel Bob needs to light his joint Coco is there to help.

Hypo
Psychedelic frog Angel Bob loves to lick.



Po-po Mile

He is trying to catch Baja in his dealing endeavors. He is a very clumsy police officer  and not even one criminal is afraid of him. While he was on duty, someone stole his belt so when you hit him with your ball in-game his pants can drop. 


The reason why we chose crowdfunding is because we need your help! We have already invested over 30,000$ for copyright, software, hardware and other costs which are only related to production of the game. Now we need your help to help us finish the game with better quality and deliver it to you our supporter as fast as possible.
Why?
To be able to create the game as good as possible and most important to be able to buy servers on which we would host our game on. Currently we are unable to implement the online Multiplayer as we need servers for that. With these servers we would cover all the platforms and unify them so that a person who owns Android can play against an iPhone user or even against Mac Os or Windows. In the future we would implement it with PS4, PS3, PSVita and Xbox One.


With your donation we would also be able to concentrate our full time towards Weed Pinball. You would give us an ability to finish the game much earlier and to implement other features into the game that all you gamers will love; from new levels to new mini games and different online competitions.

<br/>The Game</h2><p>Elfscape consists of 18 quests, including 8 big and epic ones.</p><p>Every quest tells a story of a specific character and their relation to Jushur. In the side quests, you will accompany Jushur to various situations – whether he’s celebrating a wedding, being a hairstyle consultant, teaching children how to write, or listening to local fool’s poems.</p><p>In the main quests, Jushur is searching for a way to defeat the demon. You’ll try to kill the demon’s servants and they will try to kill you. Dive into Jushur’s story and meet interesting characters, such as elven princess or your enemies from the old times. You’ll be worshipped and you’ll mourn the deaths of your friends.  </p><p>And moreover, you can just run around the world as you like and discover new territories. Have fun - pick some plants, kill some beasts -  and use gathered materials later to create ammunition, armour and potions.</p><p>You can play Elfscape on a keyboard, but it is recommended to play with gamepad (it’s especially useful when fighting with Erimha).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565899184/jaslhtkbnkl1fubhxvb4.png"" src=""""/></p><p><br/> </p><h2>Erimha</h2><p>Erimha is an ancient weapon of the Elves.

They welcome him as a hero predestined to beat the demon but Jushur’s only desire is to get as far away from the Flying island as possible. He flees the city but he is lost in the canals when the Spitter Rat attacks him. Thankfully, the Unworthy appear, ready to help the chosen one.You cannot use Erimha in this level since Jushur hasn’t gained it yet.Please, keep in mind, the demo is not 100% finished yet.Click here to download demo (Windows).Click here to download demo (macOS).Gameplay
The GameElfscape consists of 18 quests, including 8 big and epic ones.Every quest tells a story of a specific character and their relation to Jushur. In the side quests, you will accompany Jushur to various situations – whether he’s celebrating a wedding, being a hairstyle consultant, teaching children how to write, or listening to local fool’s poems.In the main quests, Jushur is searching for a way to defeat the demon. You’ll try to kill the demon’s servants and they will try to kill you. Dive into Jushur’s story and meet interesting characters, such as elven princess or your enemies from the old times. You’ll be worshipped and you’ll mourn the deaths of your friends.  And moreover, you can just run around the world as you like and discover new territories. Have fun - pick some plants, kill some beasts -  and use gathered materials later to create ammunition, armour and potions.You can play Elfscape on a keyboard, but it is recommended to play with gamepad (it’s especially useful when fighting with Erimha). ErimhaErimha is an ancient weapon of the Elves. Its effect changes depending on the type of ammunition. Erimha has three built-in slots and each bullet can be fired in two different styles. The player can alternate between the slots during a fight.  The CanalsThe Elfscape world is quite big. Better use water canals for transportation from one end to the other.     StoryRabisu! Make a deal with me!Have you ever felt that your RPG character is an almighty god with so much power, that it became quite boring? Well, elven prince Jushur Eanatum feels like this his whole life. In the Elfscape world, elves are absolutist rulers – no wonder, they’re smarter, stronger and they live longer... And the Gods want it that way.However, when elf Jushur Eanatum gets poisoned by his own servants , he finds himself standing at the gate to the afterlife. Jushur fears entering the gate so he makes a deal with a curious creature named Rabisu – granting him one more chance for life in exchange for a promise to serve Rabisu after his final death. Unfortunately, Rabisu never specified the length of that promised life.And so it happens, the first thing Jushur sees when he wakes up is demon Rabisu who came to claim his soul. Jushur runs from the demon and tries to hide in the caves under the city...  The UnworthyA wise ruler sees his folk like his own children. Children unable to live without his fatherly guidance, following him beyond death. Deep in the caves under the city live the Unworthy. They spend their whole lives worshipping the cult of the Elf, the Noble Beast Lahmu and the First High Priest.No light reaches the underground so only the prayers determine morning and night. Prophecy foretold that one day, the Elf will descend to the underground and, with the Unworthy by his side, lead a victorious war against the demon.Not too many of them realise what the word „war“ really means.   Characters Jushur Eanatum Jushur, a bored ruler of the western part of The Flying Islands. Folks love his fatherly reigning hand, kind and just at the same time. At least that’s what he seems to think. Rabisu – Master of the TowersDemon Rabisu lurks after sinful souls that  are terrified of the gods‘ final judgement. For a simple promise to become the servants in his world after their final death, the desperate deceased get one more chance in the world of the living. In the history of time, nobody has ever defeated the demon.  Ida Ida is a cheerful, very noisy person. She doesn’t care much about the prophecy and the temple. Instead, her mute brother Micha gets most of her attention. WappaWappa is a hardworking but hot-headed young man with an opinion on everything. He’s aspiring for a priest career but his hot temper (and, according to the current High Priest, lack of devoted faith) sabotages his own efforts.Binitarian  LahmuThe legendary Noble Beast Lahmu. His mere existence is to assist the Elf in the glorious war against the demon. He doesn’t seem to think too highly of people, though... CitiesThere are two big cities in the underground – Eshara and Shroomgarden. The city carved in stone - Eshara is the capital city of Elf’s cult. The High Priest Fulrad resides here. You can recognise people from the city by their simple, brownish clothing.On the contrary, Shroomgarden is built in a mushroom oasis. Instead of prayers, you can hear songs and beating of the drums – folks are much less conservative here.Cities are home for craftsmen. If Jushur brings them material, they can make anything he needs for his upcoming adventures for free (it is a sin to ask the noble Elf for money). Jushur can get anything here, from potions to armour, or Erimha ammunition.  All quests start in the cities.City of EsharaShroomgarden
WritingThere are two types of writing in the Elfscape world - elvish and human. Elvish, on the left, is read from top to bottom. Because Elves are magical creatures, even their writing is over-flown with magic, creating ornamental patterns. Human writing, on the right, is read from left to right. People are slower writers so their writing is more simple. It's not magical, but it's easy to read.ComicsIf you want to know, how the life in the underground looks like, and to discover what it means to be praying to Lahmu every day and waiting for the Elf’s arrival, you should meet Agol.Agol only wants two things in life. One, to have the least complicated life possible. Two, the heart of his beloved Naara. Watch him find out that these two wishes contradict each other – and check out his life before the arrival of the Elf in the comics here:  Click here to read the comics!Stay in touch with Elfscape universe.
