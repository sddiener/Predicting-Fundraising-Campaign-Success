Our Story
About five years ago, we both got simple shelf top home ice cream makers and started making ice cream for fun.  What started out as something innocent, ended up being a far bigger creative outlet than either of us would have dreamed.For some reason, ice cream clicked for us and provided us with a way to take the inspiration that we got from the local food community and channel that passion into something we could give back and feel proud of.  Since then we’ve take this inspiration, (and maybe some friendly competitiveness), and challenged ourselves to create new and exciting ice cream flavors on a weekly basis.  
In the spring of last year, we decided to take our ice cream to the net, and started a blog where we release one of these flavors every week and promote our suppliers and local farmers as much as we possibly can.  Flavors like Apple Fritter Apple Fritter, Sour Cream Strawberry Shortbread, Almond Green Anise and Figs, Brown Butter Cornbread, and way more.  So far we have over 100 flavors and a long ways to go. Check out our flavors at www.frozbroz.com
Since we can’t legally sell our ice cream yet, we give away two pints of the weekly flavor in a random drawing.We have a huge passion for this ice cream we’ve created, and refuse to compromise quality for extra profit.  Since we make our own ice cream base – and have many different bases that we use, we have a much more difficult path to getting the licensing require to legally bring our ice cream to market.  Many ice cream makers purchase their base pre-made, which allows them to bypass some of this licensing.  Because making our own base is crucial to the quality and breadth of flavors we create, we have no choice but to get the expensive pasteurization equipment required to get licensed, become the smallest dairy in the state of Minnesota and start selling our ice cream to the public.Thank you! 


The Impact
If we raise the money we are asking for here, we'll be able to purchase the equipment needed to get a modest start.  It will enable us to utilize the local farms we love and sell our ice cream to the public without sacrificing an ounce of quality that we require.



What We Need & What You Get
What we need is a basic list of equipment to enable us to produce our ice cream on a larger scale.   Here is the list as we see it:

 

Commercial Ice Cream Machine
Vat Pasteurizer and chiller
Kitchen utensils
Packaging/labels
Ice Cream Cart
Licensing costs


With this equipment we are going to continue to make a new flavor every week and will continue to give two pints of that flavor away, but we will also sell that flavor and whatever we have in our inventory every Saturday and at any other appearances we may make at local farmers markets and through CSA's.  In addition we hope to be able to start shipping our ice cream across the country.

If we don't meet our goal, we will cry, post a video of us crying, and then we'll go the old school route to get the remainder of our funding and take our business plan to investors and banks and become slaves to the man to make sure this ice cream gets out.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Goodnuss is here to change the nut milking industry!</h3>
<p>Everyone loves fresh, healthy almond milk. But to make nut milk at home, you have to wash and rinse the nuts, soak them, blend them, clean the blender, strain the nut pulp through a cheese cloth sack, then wait for hours for it to be ready ...what a chore!</p>
<div>
<p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507852795/gfmzkxjtogubqxqpmtr3.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>It's literally nutty how much time it takes to make nut milk at home! </p>
<div>You could buy it at the store, but there is a problem with that, nut milk available in stores typically only has about 2% nuts in the whole carton! How could you possibly get the health benefits of almond milk if there are hardly any nuts in it?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>And the rest of the ""milk"" is full of additives and synthetic vitamins that actually cause inflammation and other health problems, rather than providing you with the good benefits you expect.</p>
<p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507852317/dwgwi4rmvg1etygmzhgi.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>You could also buy one of those expensive, bulky blenders that ONLY works with nuts, but who needs ANOTHER expensive kitchen appliance that takes up a bunch of space and is hard to clean?</p>
<p>That's why we invented the Goodnuss Sack, to solve all of this...</p>

<div>It's a new kind of nut milk bag that lets you say goodbye to messes in your kitchen, overpriced appliances, unhealthy store bought milk, and long hours spent making nut milk instead of spending time with your family and friends.</div>

<div>    </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>It accomplishes this because we do all of the hard work for you. We pre-blend and soak the nuts so that you don't have to! All you need to do is just add filtered water. You don't even have to look up a recipe.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>We use only the highest quality ingredients, because that's what you deserve.</div>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And you never have to worry about the nutrition label because you can KNOW that we will never put in any harmful additives, and your milk will always be made from 100% nuts... never 2% nuts and 98% filler ingredients you can't pronounce.</div>

</div></div>","Goodnuss is here to change the nut milking industry!
Everyone loves fresh, healthy almond milk. But to make nut milk at home, you have to wash and rinse the nuts, soak them, blend them, clean the blender, strain the nut pulp through a cheese cloth sack, then wait for hours for it to be ready ...what a chore!

    
 
It's literally nutty how much time it takes to make nut milk at home! 
You could buy it at the store, but there is a problem with that, nut milk available in stores typically only has about 2% nuts in the whole carton! How could you possibly get the health benefits of almond milk if there are hardly any nuts in it?
 

And the rest of the ""milk"" is full of additives and synthetic vitamins that actually cause inflammation and other health problems, rather than providing you with the good benefits you expect.
  
 
You could also buy one of those expensive, bulky blenders that ONLY works with nuts, but who needs ANOTHER expensive kitchen appliance that takes up a bunch of space and is hard to clean?
That's why we invented the Goodnuss Sack, to solve all of this...


 

   

 
It's a new kind of nut milk bag that lets you say goodbye to messes in your kitchen, overpriced appliances, unhealthy store bought milk, and long hours spent making nut milk instead of spending time with your family and friends.
 

Goodnuss makes it easier than ever to get the health benefits of homemade nut milk
along with the time-saving convenience of store bought milk. It truly combines the best of both worlds.


    
 

It accomplishes this because we do all of the hard work for you. We pre-blend and soak the nuts so that you don't have to! All you need to do is just add filtered water. You don't even have to look up a recipe.
 

We use only the highest quality ingredients, because that's what you deserve.
 
    

 
And you never have to worry about the nutrition label because you can KNOW that we will never put in any harmful additives, and your milk will always be made from 100% nuts... never 2% nuts and 98% filler ingredients you can't pronounce.
 
        

 
       


. 
      
  
Seriously, it's that easy. It's as convenient as store bought milk but it's as healthy as the stuff you make right in your own kitchen. Made with only all natural, whole food ingredients so you know EXACTLY what you're getting.       
                            
        We make our pulp with whole ingredients so it's just like you were making the pulp yourself. It will give you the freshest, healthiest raw nut milk! Don't forget to use the pulp after you've milked it. It is packed with protein and fiber and makes a great snack, cookie base, or body scrub..you name it!
 
    
    Goodnuss is a nut-milk innovation company headquartered in the quirky city of Portland,Oregon. We created a solution to fix a problem that we had ourselves, and now we're on a mission to fix it for you too.Goodnuss offers freshly made pre-blended pulp inside a patented and reusable mess-free nut milk bag. This allows nut milk drinkers to conveniently reuse the bag without needing to crush nuts or find a recipe. Just add water, shake, strain, enjoy, and then re-use!

We expect the actual production of the Goodnuss sacks to be completed in 4 months.

<h3><u><strong>What is it?</strong></u></h3>
<p><i><strong>Good Life Market Delivery</strong></i> is a sustainable delivery service which offers package free bulk and organic grocery foods and home goods, delivered directly to your door!*</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588350374/fnm27vf3yalokveozli4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We follow a traditional milkman model where any reusable containers we deliver your goods in, when you are finished with those containers, we will pick those up from your door. We will then sanitize the containers for reuse, and provide a credit back into your account to use for your next delivery! In this uncertain time where health is our utmost concern and we are being asked to practice social distancing, many natural and other local foods stores have either had to shutter their store or if they are open for business, they have closed down their bulk sections.  When things reopen, there is not telling the state of our natural food stores- if they will reopen.  Our online GLM Delivery store team  is taking the utmost precaution in sanitization and safeguards and with our sustainable delivery model, we can deliver to you the same bulk model you have come to love!</p>
<p>To begin with, our online store will offer a selection of home goods- kitchen items, to go ware, laundry and general cleaning products, bath and beauty products, all natural and toxin free as well as in sustainable compostable, or reusable/ refillable containers, along side of selection of natural snacks, dried goods, crackers, nuts and breakfast items- not to mention coffee ( we Portlander’s MUST have our local coffee! ).</p>
<p><strong>Good Life Market Delivery website</strong> ( currently under construction but feel free to peruse it! <a href=""https://www.goodlifemarketdelivery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.goodlifemarketdelivery.com </a>)  will be the one stop shop for you to order items on your grocery list and get delivery scheduled. It is also the place to schedule your pick up of containers for reuse.</p>
<p>Over 45% of all our waste in America comes from grocery waste - all that individual one-time-use packaging. We endeavor to disrupt that number by providing you with smart swap options of more popular store items for natural, toxin free, longer lasting and ( for the food p[rocuts) better tasting which will have you healthier, saving more $, saving you time of having to go out and shop ( if you can venture out these days) and saving our Earth.</p>
<p><i>*Our current delivery location is the Portland metro area and will include Portland, Beaverton, Hillsboro, Aloha, Gladstone, Oregon City, Lake Oswego, and West Linn addresses initially.</i></p> <h3><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></h3>
<p>Vote for change to healthier and sustainable shopping habits with your dollars and your voice! Help us start a revolution.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We need $12,000 to start the beta test of our delivery model</strong>. With these funds, we shall finish the crafting of our online store delivery website and infrastructure, get our delivery drivers hired and trained and begin our beta test phase where we will sell, deliver and pick up for a group of 40 patrons for two months in order to smooth out how we function- and then open to the Portland metro area public! We already have some investors (we are still open to more investors so get in touch if you are interested!) and we the founders of Good Life Market have put in hours and money to establish our structure, solidify our partnerships with great suppliers, start getting stock ordered - all the incredible goods we will offer!- and get organized to deliver this goodness to you, sans the packaging.  With your contributions, Good Life Market Delivery can start the beta test phase this summer and look to a public opening in early Fall 2020!</li>
<li>We have rewards! Of course, everything we are offering for rewards is zero waste - and will be delivered to your door when you make your order through our online store! <i><strong>However, we know that not everyone lives in the Portland area </strong>that would like to show support here so we are more than happy to send you your reward if applicable via snail mail- using recycled materials. </i>

<h3><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></h3>
<p><strong>Love our earth, enjoy cost savings in bulk, and support sustainable shopping. </strong></p>
<p>Living a zero-waste life is good for you and good for the Earth and everything on it. In our current society, it is difficult to shop for our weekly grocery needs and be aware of the amount of trash we are creating with every product we buy.  And yet, to live a life of producing little to no garbage is terribly inconvenient even though it the most obvious choice for solving the environmental problems caused by landfills.

Plus,  added cost benefit by paying for the refilling of reusable containers for your goods.</p> <p>GLM Delivery offers ( or will offer ) bulk food, cosmetics, toiletries, soaps, household products, cleaners and more from suppliers who have amazing products and honor our environment.

<p>Beginning any large project like this, there is the possibility of unforeseen circumstances where we may not be able to open as soon as we would like, or worst case scenario, at all.

</div><p> </p></div>","What is it?
Good Life Market Delivery is a sustainable delivery service which offers package free bulk and organic grocery foods and home goods, delivered directly to your door!*

We follow a traditional milkman model where any reusable containers we deliver your goods in, when you are finished with those containers, we will pick those up from your door. We will then sanitize the containers for reuse, and provide a credit back into your account to use for your next delivery! In this uncertain time where health is our utmost concern and we are being asked to practice social distancing, many natural and other local foods stores have either had to shutter their store or if they are open for business, they have closed down their bulk sections.  When things reopen, there is not telling the state of our natural food stores- if they will reopen.  Our online GLM Delivery store team  is taking the utmost precaution in sanitization and safeguards and with our sustainable delivery model, we can deliver to you the same bulk model you have come to love!
To begin with, our online store will offer a selection of home goods- kitchen items, to go ware, laundry and general cleaning products, bath and beauty products, all natural and toxin free as well as in sustainable compostable, or reusable/ refillable containers, along side of selection of natural snacks, dried goods, crackers, nuts and breakfast items- not to mention coffee ( we Portlander’s MUST have our local coffee! ).
Good Life Market Delivery website ( currently under construction but feel free to peruse it! https://www.goodlifemarketdelivery.com )  will be the one stop shop for you to order items on your grocery list and get delivery scheduled. It is also the place to schedule your pick up of containers for reuse.
Over 45% of all our waste in America comes from grocery waste - all that individual one-time-use packaging. We endeavor to disrupt that number by providing you with smart swap options of more popular store items for natural, toxin free, longer lasting and ( for the food p[rocuts) better tasting which will have you healthier, saving more $, saving you time of having to go out and shop ( if you can venture out these days) and saving our Earth.
*Our current delivery location is the Portland metro area and will include Portland, Beaverton, Hillsboro, Aloha, Gladstone, Oregon City, Lake Oswego, and West Linn addresses initially. What We Need & What You Get
Vote for change to healthier and sustainable shopping habits with your dollars and your voice! Help us start a revolution.


We need $12,000 to start the beta test of our delivery model. With these funds, we shall finish the crafting of our online store delivery website and infrastructure, get our delivery drivers hired and trained and begin our beta test phase where we will sell, deliver and pick up for a group of 40 patrons for two months in order to smooth out how we function- and then open to the Portland metro area public! We already have some investors (we are still open to more investors so get in touch if you are interested!) and we the founders of Good Life Market have put in hours and money to establish our structure, solidify our partnerships with great suppliers, start getting stock ordered - all the incredible goods we will offer!- and get organized to deliver this goodness to you, sans the packaging.  With your contributions, Good Life Market Delivery can start the beta test phase this summer and look to a public opening in early Fall 2020!
We have rewards! Of course, everything we are offering for rewards is zero waste - and will be delivered to your door when you make your order through our online store! However, we know that not everyone lives in the Portland area that would like to show support here so we are more than happy to send you your reward if applicable via snail mail- using recycled materials. 

If we don't reach our goal, we are still going to use every cent towards Good Life Market Delivery, which is why we have opted for flexible funding. Every little bit helps and will make a huge impact on helping us make our zero waste dreams of changing our grocery shopping habits come true!

Peek at Some Rewards and Samples of what GLM will offer:

Refillable Mason Jar snacks, pantry items and food staples.

Bathroom zero waste options that are compostable, toxin free and aesthetically beautiful from tooth brushes to scrubs and more.

Loofahs- the natural way to clean and exfoliate.

Mason jar coffee accoutrements for the Portland Coffee lover.

Refillable cleaning products that fit mason jars and your sustainable lifestyle.


Food To Go ware- stainless steel bento boxes and travel retractable straws.

<p><strong>HELP US BRING ROSEN'S CINNAMON BUN TOAST SPREAD TO MARKET - AND BE THE FIRST TO TRY IT!</strong></p>
<p>I'm Amy Rosen, a journalist, food editor, cookbook author and recipe developer, who had an epiphany a year ago while watching my family eat cinnamon buns during the holidays. For the first time in a week, a big table of normally boisterous people, from toddlers to teens, 40-somethings to 70-year-olds, were all quiet and happily munching away on the cinnamon buns I had just baked. ""Wait a minute,"" I thought out loud. ""Everyone loves cinnamon buns. I should open up a cinnamon bun bakery!"" </p>
<p><strong>Less than 10 months later, the doors to Rosen's Cinnamon Buns swung open for business. </strong></p>
<p>Now almost a year into it, we're ready to take the next step. Almost everyone who walks into our sweet little shop says, ""I wish you could bottle that scent."" And that's exactly what we intend to do, with your help. </p>
<p>You know the delicious filling, what we call ""the goop"", inside of cinnamon buns? Well we're making it into a jarred spread, perfect on toast, drizzled over crepes, pancakes, waffles and ice cream, or even used to make your very own buns, by smearing it over pizza dough before rolling it up and baking.</p>
<p><strong>The uniquely great taste of Rosen's Cinnamon Buns will be available far and wide!</strong></p>
<p>But, we need your help to make this happen. From designing and printing labels, to buying all-natural ingredients, and jars, running a production line and heading into distribution, getting a new product to market doesn't come cheap. Become a part of the campaign and we'll be ever so grateful, plus, you'll be the first to try it!</p>

<p>1861 Distillery was founded by three friends who appreciate a good bourbon and life in the slow lane. Inspired by the opening of a railroad that brought luxury to one of the South’s most distinct towns in 1861, the distillery serves a discerning clientele who appreciate the finer things in life. The 1861 family of spirits are crafted in a slow process with only the best ingredients, including water from one of the world’s purest limestone aquifers. Today, our spirits are as iconic as the small Southern town of Thomasville, blending the same appreciation for nature, friendship and a slower pace of life that continues to define this special corner of the world.</p>
<p>Your support will allow you to have early access to goods and perks and will help us dig the well that we need to access the pure, limestone-filtered water that will produce the fine spirits that you deserve.</p>

Why not keep the convenience of a drip coffee while still keeping the fresher, richer, & bolder tastes of a Pour-Over Coffee?  Aroma helps handle ALL the hassle and time spent waiting around for your pour-over coffee. It is your new favorite robot barista! Just pour hot water into the tank & leave it be! Why Pour-Over?More meticulous than machine-drip coffee, brighter and crisper than a French press, and less hassle or danger than a stove-top percolator. That's Why. You get a fuller serving of java than you'd get from a normal coffee-maker with Pour-Over Coffee. What's Automatic Pour-Over?Just press the button and Aroma will put itself to work. The spinning tank will release the right amount of hot water into your ground coffee beans. Perfectly simulating a skilled barista's pour-over.  Also saves you a ton of time. Even Coffee ExtractionPrecise timing and water-to-coffee ratio deliver impressive consistency & handcrafted flavor                              The Perfect Pour-Over Without The FussWith Aroma, all the difficulties of pour-over coffee are handled automatically. Now, it’s a breeze to brew a cup of coffee worthy of the Specialty Coffee Association's “Golden Cup Standard.” Never sacrifice quality for convenience again.See What Others Are Saying 
Reusable Filter & Easy CleaningWith a wire mesh filter, no wasteful paper filters are needed. To clean, just rinse & set aside!             
Food Grade Certified MaterialsMaterials are certified by the FDA to be used in baby feeding products.How to Use AromaCoffee ScienceDid You Know? On average, it takes about 2.5-3minutes make a dark roasted pour-over coffee, and 3-4minutes for a light roasted one. This includes the dripping time after you stop adding water. How Much Time Wasted? Let's say you make a dark roasted pour-over coffee each morning, 5 days a week. You've spent 780 minutes (13 hours) standing on your kitchen counter waiting for your pour-over coffee in a year. What Could've Been? What could you have done instead with those times? Brush your teeth? Extra 3 minutes of sleep per day? Feed your cat? Spread your toast? Pack your bag? FunctionalityLifestyle How Much Is Coffee Costing You?Yes, Keurig is cheaper than Starbucks -- but Aroma is even Cheaper than K-cupsStarbucks Comparison: The average cost of a 120ounce coffee from Starbucks is $1.75, If you had one each morning, 5 days a week, you'd spend $455 per year. K-cup Comparison: The average cost of a k-cup is around $0.67.

If on the other hand you find yourself losing electrolytes along with water, like for example when you consume diuretics (e.g. alcohol), do intense exercise and sweat a lot, or even when you are sick and have stomach trouble, you’ll find that water is not enough.

We've successfully completed our crowdfunding campaign - thank you all so much for the support! Hydrant is an electrolyte mix biologically designed for rapid absorption and efficacy. It's reliable hydration: it just works. No gimmicks or weird ingredients. Hydrant’s proprietary formula is engineered to perfectly balance bio-available Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium and Zinc. Rather than mask the salinity with artificial flavors and sweeteners, we took a minimalist approach and combined a hint of real cane sugar with natural lemon and lime flavors. Modern routines are dehydrating, and current solutions are weak and full of unnecessary additives. 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated [1]. We work out more, we drink more and we travel more than previous generations. Daily dehydration leads to problems like fatigue, tiredness, headaches and a reduction in mental acuity [2,6 - 9]. How do we fix this?When you lose water and electrolytes and become dehydrated, the fastest way to get back to your optimum is by putting back what you need in the right ratio. Sports drinks, coconut water, enhanced water etc. aren’t using these optimal ratios:   ​A biologically balanced, rapid hydration solution, without the artificial colors, flavors and sweeteners. ​Good hydration improves mental sharpness.Whether you’re burning the midnight oil or grinding through a regular day at the office - stay sharp with perfect hydration.This is because nerves send signals around your body and brain using Sodium and Potassium [10].  Without the the right ratio of sodium and potassium (and water!) in your cells, the signaling speed is reduced.Even low levels of dehydration reduce the perception of alertness, and the ability to concentrate [6]. However you stay active, you need to put back the electrolytes you lose to keep your goals in focus.The scientific community has been researching this since the 50’s, and it’s now widely accepted that dehydration from any cause negatively impacts athletic performance [6,11]. The main symptom of dehydration is fatigue. Say goodbye to the afternoon slump with balanced hydration.It’s not totally clear what mechanism of dehydration causes fatigue, but it is likely similar to the mechanisms that affect cognition. It's accepted as one of the main symptoms of dehydration [2]. Even your mood can suffer when you’re dehydrated. Don’t be a buzzkill.Mild dehydration leads to a deterioration of mood in both men and women [12,13], drink up! Feel better when you wake up, especially after a big night out.Drinking alcohol dehydrates you because alcohol is a diuretic [14]. This makes you pee a lot, expelling water and flushing out electrolytes.  Replacing those lost fluids and electrolytes rapidly will make you feel a whole lot better the next day. Nothing’s worse than spending the day stuck inside.Replace lost fluids and electrolytes fast with Hydrant, and get back on your feet. This was the original use case for ORS [3,4]. Throw a couple packs in your suitcase for peace of mind when you travel!   ​​ ​ ​John Sherwin - Founder and Scientist at HydrantJohn is a Biological Sciences Alumni of Oxford UniversityNot wanting to join the ranks of Academia, John looked West to Silicon Valley and joined Quartzy as an early employee. Quartzy helps top notch scientists at institutions like Stanford, Harvard and MIT make their research labs more efficient.The start-up lifestyle is intense, and after a while led to fatigue at work, and outside when he should have been enjoying his 20s.  Rather than continue making tradeoffs between sleep, friends, health and career, John designed a product that could help support a demanding lifestyle, using his knowledge of human biology.  Hydrant is a very functional product & brand, without any over-promising or “fluff”.  It is hydration at its most basic scientific level - with a subtle, natural flavor.“There are a lot of brands out there that over-promise and under deliver, and I, for one, am over it. I wanted to make a product that “just works”. No wild claims, no BS. When you need it, it works. Hydrant takes care of the basics, so you have the freedom to do whatever it is that you care about.However you make your money, however you spend your time, we’ve got you covered.”Contact John at john[at]drinkhydrant.com  ​ Taste Test TeamFounders of King Restaurant in NYCThe founding team of King met in London whilst the 2 chef’s Clare de Boer and Jess Shadbolt were cooking at the River Cafe, one of London’s top restaurants.  With Annie Shi heading up the front of house, the 3 founders have quickly made a splash on the New York food scene, with excellent reviews from the New York Times and the New Yorker.  We’re proud to have had them help us hone the different iterations of Hydrant. ​ Design and Branding PartnerBased in New York City, CROSBY is a referral-only team of designers, developers, storytellers & business strategists, who love to build brands. ​ 
Advisor: Heidi Skolnik, Sports Nutritionist & Wellness ExpertHeidi Skolnik M.S., C.D.N., FACSMBiography: Heidi worked with the The NY Knicks (7 years), NY Giants (18 years), the NY Mets (15 years), and has worked with countless other athletes in the NHL, MLS, WNBA, as well as Olympic competitors, professional cyclists, marathoners, and collegiate athletes. She also sits on the board of The National Osteoporosis Foundation and is an advisor to the bookazine Eat This, Not That.www.nutritionconditioning.net ​ It’s hard to know what’s “healthy” in this era for three main reasons:
Nutrition science is still evolving
The spread of misinformation on the internet is at an all-time high
Companies see an opportunity to make a quick buck and make unproven or “half-truth” claims, often hidden behind clever wording
Our product does one thing only: hydration. It is our duty to be current on hydration science, and we take this very seriously.Our team is built on scientific principles. We wouldn’t put our names on claims that aren’t backed up with good science, and we would only recommend Hydrant to you if it really will benefit you. ​  ​Why does Hydrant contain a small amount of sugar?The main reason is function, as sugar activates the sodium-glucose co-transport mechanism which is basically a molecular pump in your gut. When sugar is present, the pump is activated, which speeds up your absorption of electrolytes and water. Products without sugar are unable to take advantage of this effect.We also HATE that weird taste you get with diet sweeteners, even the natural ones. We would rather have a “less sweet” drink that tastes natural than add those. Is this organic?No - although we support naturally sourcing our ingredients where possible, getting organic electrolytes is expensive, and at this time we cannot meet the threshold of organic ingredients to be a certified organic product. Is it GMO free?No - although some of our ingredients are certified GMO free, not all of them are so we cannot get the certification ourselves. GMO or not, our ingredients are carefully selected with your health in mind. Why not just drink water?Water is great - it makes up 70% of our bodies, is refreshing, and important for your health. When you aren’t living a demanding lifestyle - you’ll be fine with just water. If on the other hand you find yourself losing electrolytes along with water, like for example when you consume diuretics (e.g. alcohol), do intense exercise and sweat a lot, or even when you are sick and have stomach trouble, you’ll find that water is not enough. Modern routines are more dehydrating than ever, you need to replace the electrolytes you use so that your body can return to its optimum state, allowing you to perform at your best. What are the ingredients?Functional:Cane Sugar, Sodium Citrate, Potassium Citrate, Sodium Chloride, Magnesium Citrate, Zinc Gluconate.Flavor:Lime Juice Powder, Citric Acid What are ""diet sweeteners""?In the video, we reference how there are no diet sweeteners in Hydrant.  This means there are no artificial sweeteners, but also none of those ""natural"" sweeteners on the market (like stevia). How do I make a purchase?Pick a perk to support, and submit it! Why do I have to pay more for international shipping?Shipping costs outside of the USA are significantly higher, so we can't offer free shipping and have to add it individually by country.  We only want to pass on the cost of shipping, no more. Are duties/taxes included in the price?NO. For international backers, your government may tax you on the product as it enters your country, and we do not cover these for you.  Each country has slightly different rules on duties/taxes, so please do check those and make sure you factor them in when you choose to back our campaign! Where do I put my shipping address?We’ll reach out to get your shipping information as we get closer to delivery date! Where is the product created?We’re designed and made in USA.  General hydration:[1] 75% of Americans are dehydrated: Survey of 3003 Americans, Nutrition Information Center, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (April 14, 1998)[2] Symptoms of dehydration: MedlinePlus.gov, Mayo Clinic.

<p>I have designed these sauces to be HOT, but most importantly, to TASTE GOOD! We make the best tasting, most edible hot sauces that money can buy. All our sauces have heat AND are something that you actually crave to put on your food. </p>
<p>Son Of A John was an unexpected arrival that began life as a long term project to grow Japanese Maple trees. I also started growing a garden in the back yard - because homegrown vegetables are undisputedly the best!  With dreams of bountiful harvests, I planted my garden…and along with the tomatoes, carrots, and everything else, I planted WAY too many peppers. My veggies needed to drink and I gave them rainwater. They needed to eat too, and I became a worm farmer so they had good organic fertilizer. They thrived and produced – a LOT.  What to do with all those peppers? HOT SAUCE!!! I went into the kitchen and developed my first hot sauce recipe, Light My Fire…and it was good! Very good! Thus, Son Of A John was born – the best tasting (HOT) hot sauces in the South!</p>
<p>Being a good cook and liking to share, I began giving bottles to friends and family.  I got rave reviews from everyone on my first sauce and went back to the kitchen to create the next two even hotter sauces, Smokin’ Ghost and Ant Bite – both of which turned out just as tasty as the first…full of flavor and just as fantastic, if not BETTER!</p>
<p>People were trying to give me money for bottles to take to their friends and family, and more than one person told me I should start selling them because they really are THAT good! At this stage, I realize I have a knack for what I am doing. I have sold individual bottles and 3 bottle sets, which are a big time hit!  Everyone loves them!  Now, people are buying cases instead of bottles.  There is hot sauce everywhere!!  To keep up with the demand, it is time to get some help and work with a co-packer because Son Of A John has now outgrown my kitchen.</p>

We all lead and live busy lives, always on the go, and often we do not have the time to take care of ourselves. We have all been here before, we wake up and are getting ready for work, and we go to the kitchen and start preparing our vegetables and fruits to make our favorite juice blend. We have just created a delicious and healthy beverage full of vitamins and nutrients that we need to kick-start our day. In the wake of creating our beverage, we have created an incredible mess and we are now almost running late for work. Traditional juicers have many moving parts that need to be cleaned and stored away properly which is very time-consuming.

The ""I M Possible"" or ""Impossible"". We all lead and live busy lives, always on the go, and often we do not have the time to take care of ourselves. We have all been here before, we wake up and are getting ready for work, and we go to the kitchen and start preparing our vegetables and fruits to make our favorite juice blend. We have just created a delicious and healthy beverage full of vitamins and nutrients that we need to kick-start our day. In the wake of creating our beverage, we have created an incredible mess and we are now almost running late for work. Traditional juicers have many moving parts that need to be cleaned and stored away properly which is very time-consuming.

I am a Professional and Lifestyle Dominatrix, and I live and work in Toronto, Canada. In Addition to being a Domme, I am also quite active writing, podcasting, life coaching, mentoring, volunteering, &amp; acting as an advocate for mental health. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1036695/files/20141121163752-01.jpg?1416616672"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Who wants these chocolates? Just about anyone. Do you need a subtle hint to give your lover in an attempt to spice things up in the bedroom? Offering them a pair of chocolate handcuffs would be a delicious way to get the message across. Do you want to tell your lover that you fantasize about licking her toes? Purchase some chocolate toes and show her how you'd do it. Whether you are looking to make things more interesting or you are a fetishist looking for new forms of expression, there's a tasty solution here for you. <br/><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/829991/files/20140902182015-flogger_leather_boots_sexy_domme_dominatrix_fetish.jpg?1409707215"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I was disappointed at the lack of kinky chocolates available in local sex stores. After doing some research and realizing that there really isn't much out there, I decided to do something about it. I wanted to give people more than a chocolate that vaguely resembled a part of the anatomy or favourite toy, I wanted to give people an experience in chocolate. Regardless of your particular kink or fetish, there will certainly be something that titillates you. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I will be releasing two lines of Dominantly Delicious Chocolates. The first will be recreations of My body. These aren't items that have been sculpted to resemble Me, but rather they are exact replicas. The chocolates are made from moulds taken directly from My body by a skilled molding professional. I am starting with: The Toe Bar, Peep Toe Platform Shoes, and a recreation of My lips. This is just the tip of the iceberg. More chocolates cast from various parts of My body will be released on an ongoing basis. <br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/829998/files/20140902182401-DSC_2348.JPG?1409707441"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>The second line of chocolates will be focused on My favourite toys and tools, the first of which will be a chocolate recreation of a real pair of Handcuffs. Like the body parts, these will be created from molds of actual items, not tiny sculpted replicas of them.  <div>
<br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Your contributions are the final piece in this nearly-assembled puzzle. Having the initial moulds of My body &amp; toys made has been the first step. The next step is to have production moulds &amp; packaging created. Until this venture, I never appreciated how much money is spent on properly packaging a consumer item. Anything I raise above and beyond the immediate costs of paying for the moulds &amp; packaging (when added to My own savings) will be used to secure a 3D scanner &amp; printer, as well as other stretch goals. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A few initial points:</p>
<p>1. You can contribute to this campaign anonymously - simply check the box that reads ""don't display my name on the campaign page"" when you make payment. </p>
<p>2. Any items sent to you will be shipped discreetly. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3. You can select your level of anonymity when being mentioned on My website, newsletter, blog etc. based on the various perks. Simply let Me know how you would like be listed when I express My appreciation (eg. John Smith, J. Smith, J.S., slave john, etc.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Any money raised, whether I reach My goal or not, will first go towards paying for production moulds &amp; clamshell packaging. Remaining funds will be used to purchase a 3D scanner followed by a 3D printer. As stretch goals are reached, the money will be spent to facilitate the creation of the stretch goal items. If any money is left over it will be used to assist in securing a distribution centre that will double as My event venue. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/830004/files/20140902182459-leather_bullwhip_dress_boots_pro_domme_fetish_dominatrix.jpg?1409707499"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The perks have been designed to fill two main categories. The first is for people who wish to contribute and receive some thank-you items in the mail in the form of chocolates and photographs. The second category of perks is for those of you who still want the physical items, but also wish to spend some one on one time with Me.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Stretch Goals</h3>
<div>If I reach $30,000 I will add a chocolate blindfold to the selection of chocolates. Everyone who pledged $50 or more will receive one (or more depending on their chosen perk) free with their order. Everyone who pledged less than $50 will be able to purchase them at a reduced price. </div>
<div>If I reach $40,000 I will add a chocolate paddle to the selection of chocolates with the same stipulations as the chocolate blindfold. </div>
<div>If I reach $50,000 I will add a chocolate whip to the selection of chocolates. This will be a larger item. Everyone who pledged $75 or more will receive one (or more depending on their chosen perk) for free. Anyone who pledged less will be able to purchase the whip at a reduced price. </div>
<div>If My pledges exceed $75,000 I will follow through with the stretch goal that was (not-so) subtly hinted at in My video. I will undergo breast augmentation. Afterwards, I will have a 3D scan taken of My new 'assets'. From this scan I'll have a unique and very limited-run chocolate created. Everyone who pledged $200 or more will receive one (or more, depending on the perk chosen) for free. Everyone who pledged will be able to purchase My chocolate 'assets'. This item will <i>never  </i>be available in any store or on any website. Due to the technical nature and recovery time involved with this particular stretch goal, the fulfillment date will be later than the other perks. I will keep you updated. </div>
<div>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/830005/files/20140902182528-lace_fetish_pro_domme_outdoor_dominatrix.jpg?1409707528"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<br/>If I exceed $100,000, I will be hosting a  launch party. Everyone who pledges will receive a free invite. Varying levels of VIP status will be distributed based on pledges. If you are unable to make it, the party will be live-streamed for you, and I will have a camera following Me everywhere. If you are a VIP pledger and are unable to make it, you'll receive some live VIP treatment during the party. There will be a number of prizes being drawn during the course of the party, and only those in attendance (live or virtual) will be able to claim them. These prizes will range from some of My personal items to one on one time with Me. </div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Asking for help isn't something that I do easily. This project is extremely important to Me. I'm a diverse woman, both intellectually and financially, and this new venture excites Me, however it is something that I am unable to launch without assistance.<br/><br/>If you have any questions that you would like answered, feel free to ask them publicly or privately. </p>

</div></div>","Sex and Chocolate. Few things go together better. Considering My tastes and proclivities since youth, it's fitting that I'm not starting a 'vanilla' candy company. I am a Professional and Lifestyle Dominatrix, and I live and work in Toronto, Canada. In Addition to being a Domme, I am also quite active writing, podcasting, life coaching, mentoring, volunteering, & acting as an advocate for mental health. Who wants these chocolates? Just about anyone. Do you need a subtle hint to give your lover in an attempt to spice things up in the bedroom? Offering them a pair of chocolate handcuffs would be a delicious way to get the message across. Do you want to tell your lover that you fantasize about licking her toes? Purchase some chocolate toes and show her how you'd do it. Whether you are looking to make things more interesting or you are a fetishist looking for new forms of expression, there's a tasty solution here for you. I was disappointed at the lack of kinky chocolates available in local sex stores. After doing some research and realizing that there really isn't much out there, I decided to do something about it. I wanted to give people more than a chocolate that vaguely resembled a part of the anatomy or favourite toy, I wanted to give people an experience in chocolate. Regardless of your particular kink or fetish, there will certainly be something that titillates you. I will be releasing two lines of Dominantly Delicious Chocolates. The first will be recreations of My body. These aren't items that have been sculpted to resemble Me, but rather they are exact replicas. The chocolates are made from moulds taken directly from My body by a skilled molding professional. I am starting with: The Toe Bar, Peep Toe Platform Shoes, and a recreation of My lips. This is just the tip of the iceberg. More chocolates cast from various parts of My body will be released on an ongoing basis. The second line of chocolates will be focused on My favourite toys and tools, the first of which will be a chocolate recreation of a real pair of Handcuffs. Like the body parts, these will be created from molds of actual items, not tiny sculpted replicas of them.  
Your contributions are the final piece in this nearly-assembled puzzle. Having the initial moulds of My body & toys made has been the first step. The next step is to have production moulds & packaging created. Until this venture, I never appreciated how much money is spent on properly packaging a consumer item. Anything I raise above and beyond the immediate costs of paying for the moulds & packaging (when added to My own savings) will be used to secure a 3D scanner & printer, as well as other stretch goals. 



What I Need & What You Get

A few initial points:
1. You can contribute to this campaign anonymously - simply check the box that reads ""don't display my name on the campaign page"" when you make payment. 
2. Any items sent to you will be shipped discreetly. 
3. You can select your level of anonymity when being mentioned on My website, newsletter, blog etc. based on the various perks. Simply let Me know how you would like be listed when I express My appreciation (eg. John Smith, J. Smith, J.S., slave john, etc.)
Any money raised, whether I reach My goal or not, will first go towards paying for production moulds & clamshell packaging. Remaining funds will be used to purchase a 3D scanner followed by a 3D printer. As stretch goals are reached, the money will be spent to facilitate the creation of the stretch goal items. If any money is left over it will be used to assist in securing a distribution centre that will double as My event venue. 

The perks have been designed to fill two main categories. The first is for people who wish to contribute and receive some thank-you items in the mail in the form of chocolates and photographs. The second category of perks is for those of you who still want the physical items, but also wish to spend some one on one time with Me.

Stretch Goals
If I reach $30,000 I will add a chocolate blindfold to the selection of chocolates. Everyone who pledged $50 or more will receive one (or more depending on their chosen perk) free with their order. Everyone who pledged less than $50 will be able to purchase them at a reduced price. 
If I reach $40,000 I will add a chocolate paddle to the selection of chocolates with the same stipulations as the chocolate blindfold. 
If I reach $50,000 I will add a chocolate whip to the selection of chocolates. This will be a larger item. Everyone who pledged $75 or more will receive one (or more depending on their chosen perk) for free. Anyone who pledged less will be able to purchase the whip at a reduced price. 
If My pledges exceed $75,000 I will follow through with the stretch goal that was (not-so) subtly hinted at in My video. I will undergo breast augmentation. Afterwards, I will have a 3D scan taken of My new 'assets'. From this scan I'll have a unique and very limited-run chocolate created. Everyone who pledged $200 or more will receive one (or more, depending on the perk chosen) for free. Everyone who pledged will be able to purchase My chocolate 'assets'. This item will never  be available in any store or on any website. Due to the technical nature and recovery time involved with this particular stretch goal, the fulfillment date will be later than the other perks. I will keep you updated. 




If I exceed $100,000, I will be hosting a  launch party. Everyone who pledges will receive a free invite. Varying levels of VIP status will be distributed based on pledges. If you are unable to make it, the party will be live-streamed for you, and I will have a camera following Me everywhere. If you are a VIP pledger and are unable to make it, you'll receive some live VIP treatment during the party. There will be a number of prizes being drawn during the course of the party, and only those in attendance (live or virtual) will be able to claim them. These prizes will range from some of My personal items to one on one time with Me. 



The Impact
Asking for help isn't something that I do easily. This project is extremely important to Me. I'm a diverse woman, both intellectually and financially, and this new venture excites Me, however it is something that I am unable to launch without assistance.If you have any questions that you would like answered, feel free to ask them publicly or privately.

<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>Bowls are a great way to store things and easy to manage, just like Tupperware, but if we stored everything in our fridge in containers, we’d never have any space in there!</p>
<p>So of course, the solution is simple – Ziploc and other kinds of storage bags, but once it’s time to get out the soup, leftovers, or freezer meals that you’ve put in there, they’re such a hassle to work with. They can’t stand upright, they fall over when you try to put them in pots and pans, and then you’re left with more of your food on the kitchen floor and the counter than on your plate.</p>
<p>But what if there was a device that gave you an easy way to manage your bags in the kitchen, and also doubled as a drying rack for your storage bags?</p>
<p><strong>That’s where our Handy Helpers come in.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>Having 20 Dishes Handy Helper Hands-Free Baggy Holders is just like having an extra set of hands in the kitchen. With easy to use clips and slid base to hold your bags in place, handle up to a gallon of liquid and other food items with no spills, and no worry.</p>
<p>Use them to hold your bags in place whether you’re storing food, need to have your bag open while you’re cooking and making meals, or just to dry out your storage bags between use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>The 20 Dishes Handy Helper Hands Free Baggy Holder Team is looking to raise enough funding for our very first production run. We’ve already tested and had great success with the prototype, so now it’s time to get manufacturing so we can bring them right to you!</p>
<p>But we don’t want your support in exchange for nothing! Therefore, we invite you to check out our reward tiers, where you have the chance to secure your very own set of 20 Dishes Handy Helper Hands Free Baggy Holders, starting with the 2-pack reward for the low pledge of just $15. Get as much as you’d like (trust me, we’re not complaining), and hey, why not make a couple donations on behalf of your friends who love cooking?</p>
<p> </p>

I want to share with you our exciting journey of how we have improved the quality of life of over 10,000 families by building over 150 bee hives a day, training beekeepers and harvesting tastebud tantalising ethical, cold pressed HONEY.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509119334/fsyserqh0ppmocdr4emv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Before Mama Buci I was a Hedge Fund Manager but one day while I was enjoying the trappings of my success I realised that there had to be <strong>more to life</strong> than just making money.  I wanted to do more to help others in a philanthropic way and decided to focus my newfound commitment on the poorest communities in Africa . So I jacked in the day job and started my search for the best way to do this.</p>
<p>As with anything in life I tried and failed but I got back on my horse as I was determined not to give up on my mission.  It was essential to continue sustaining the <strong>school</strong> we had built as part the initial projects I had already started in the community.</p>
<p>It was then that my dear friend, John Enright, mentioned the potential of commercial bee keeping.  I threw myself at this new idea and created Mama Buci.  After a lot of time and investment we have finally been able to have a positive impact, <strong>helping over 10,000 families </strong>in Zambia!  But there is <strong>more to be done</strong> which is why I am here asking for<strong> your help!</strong></p>
<p>Mama Buci has built over 105,000 beehives which provide a <strong>secure income</strong> for over 10,000 families.  But our <strong>ambition is much bigger</strong> than this.  By 2022 we want to have over <strong>500,000</strong> hives across the Zambian forest.  This would provide secure income for 50,000 families and provide <strong>education for over 100,000 children!</strong>  In fact, every single jar of delicious Mama Buci honey sold provides education and a meal for a child. </p>
<p>I <strong>invite</strong> <strong>you</strong> to join me on the Mama Buci journey...and to play a part in the effort that will make a difference to the lives of <strong>thousands</strong> of people across Zambia!</p>

<p>Mama Buci honey is lovingly hand-harvested by over <strong>10,000</strong> trusted families in the virgin Miombo forests of Central Zambia. The amber, polyfloral, raw honey is produced from hive to bottle with <strong>no additives, preservatives, economic adulterants or other nasties</strong>.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We can’t take all the credit for its delicious taste though, as it’s the millions of bees that do most of the hard work. The African bees take their nectar and pollen from a rich variety of wildflowers in the Miombo forest that change from season to season. This is why we have two different types of honey, our summer and winter harvest.</p>
<p>The <strong>Summer</strong> <strong>Harvest</strong> has a light amber, floral taste with tantalising hints of aniseed and fennel. It’s earthy flavours make it a great accompaniment to cheese or other savoury foods.</p>
<p>The <strong>Winter</strong> <strong>Harvest</strong> has a rich, sweet, dark amber flavour with comforting hints of black treacle (molasses). It tastes scrumptious spread over toast, drizzled over yogurt or stirred in your favourite brew.</p>

<p>Beekeeping has been a popular income-generating activity in Zambia for centuries. However, most of the honey produced is kept in traditional bark hives, which involves a harvesting process that strips the bark from the tree ultimately leading to its death. This not only has a negative impact on the environment but also to the beekeepers income as the bees need to feed off the trees to produce honey.</p>
<p>This all changed however with the introduction of the<strong> top bar beehive</strong> which is where our delicious honey is created.  The top bar hive yields <strong>twice</strong> the amount of honey than the traditional bark hive and causes absolutely <strong>no damage</strong> to the trees and surrounding forest. </p>
<p>After 2 years of struggling with technical problems involved with the beehives themselves my partner came up with the new design of the tree top bar hive. To our delight, the bees started to flourish, producing over <strong>12kg</strong> of honey on average per hive in a structure that, if maintained properly, could last a lifetime. That’s when we knew we had found something with the potential to really make a difference.</p>
<p>Now we are building over <strong>150</strong> beehives a day, 5 days a week, in our local Zambian workshop. We have provided over <strong>105,000</strong> beehives which will produce over<strong> 400</strong> tonnes of delicious raw honey this year alone.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509119692/vfwakkwwugsybcuj5axz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Our focus starts with <strong>educating the beekeepers and families</strong> on how to work with their land to help maintain a <strong>healthy eco-system</strong>.  Mama Buci supports over 10,000 families in Zambia by providing them with beehives and beekeeper training needed to produce delicious raw honey that has a positive impact on the environment. In order to rebuild and invigorate impoverished communities, <strong>education is key</strong>, and that’s what is at the heart of the Mama Buci story.  Over the years we have watched <strong>communities, individuals and forests</strong> flourish.</p>

<p>In 2006 we set up the <strong>Luyando</strong> school in Kamafwesa which is now enjoyed by over <strong>420 children</strong> and provides work for 11 local teachers. The school has made such a difference to the prospects of this community and our goal is to continue to support more schools as Mama Buci grows. As part of our vision to support education, we also set up the charity <strong>Give Hope International </strong>which manages and expands Mama Buci's educational aspirations which it is now doing in Zambia, Malawi and Ethiopa.</p>

<p><strong>What does Mama Buci mean?</strong><br/>Mother Honey in Bemba, the local language</p>
<p><strong>Where does Mama Buci honey come from?</strong><br/>Our honey is from the virgin Miombo forests in Zambia</p>
<p><strong>How much money does Mama Buci give to the Luyando school?</strong><br/>For every jar sold Mama Buci donates a minimum of 50p which is the equivalent to a meal a day for children attending.</p>
<p><strong>Does Mama Buci run the school?</strong><br/>No, the school is run by the teachers, but was founded by Mama Buci CEO Martin Zuch. The school is funded by Good Hope International, a registered charity.</p>
<p><strong>How many children attend the school?</strong><br/>At the moment, there are 420 children attending, across all age groups from different villages. As incomes improve, families will be able to afford to send their children to school as education in Zambia is not free.  The school we support is for those who are unable to afford to educate their children.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the Winter honey so dark and the Summer so light?</strong><br/>The colour of the honey is determined by the nectar that is collected from the local flora and what is in flower when. This affects the colour and honey flavour. As have 2 harvests this reflected in the colour and flavour variations of the 2 seasons</p>
<p><strong>How have lives been transformed through the Mama Buci beekeeping program?</strong><br/>Beekeeping can take people out of poverty and because we pay a fair price for the honey harvested there is positive impact on not just the beekeepers’ families but also within the village. For example, where they were living in poor accommodation, they are now able to live in brick houses with steel roofs protecting them from the elements.  Please visit our site to learn more:  <a href=""http://mamabuci.com/meetthebeekeepers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mamabuci.com/meetthebeekeepers/</a></p>
<p><strong>Can I cook with Mama Buci Honey?</strong><br/>Yes, you can use Mama Buci honey in your recipes where honey is an ingredient or as a sugar substitute.</p>
<p><strong>When will my Christmas Gift PERK be despatched?</strong><br/>We aim to despatch your perk within 14 days of you signing up, so that it arrives to you in plenty of time for gifting. We will contact you to tell you its on its way.</p>
<p><strong>Will my Perk be tracked?</strong><br/>Yes where possible your parcel will be tracked and you will be provided with tracking information at the time of despatch.</p>
<p><strong>How long will it take for my Perk to arrive?</strong><br/>Depending on your Perk and country, it should arrive within 5-7 days of despatch.</p>
<p><strong>How many beekeepers are producing honey for Mama Buci?</strong><br/>Our beekeeper numbers are increasing all the time but there are currently 11,000 Beekeepers with whom we are working.</p>
<p><strong>Do the beekeepers have to pay for the hives that you supply?</strong><br/>No, we provide all the beekeepers with between and 5 and 10 hives free, as well as protective clothing.</p>
<p><strong>How do the beekeepers get paid?</strong><br/>Each beekeeper is paid cash on the day of honey harvesting, by weight.</p>
<p><strong>How does Mama Buci choose the beekeepers?</strong><br/>We work closely with the village elders in the first instance and either the Elder, the equivalent of a Chief/Leader, nominates an individual(s) or the village will nominate the person(s) that they think should be the beekeeper.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any women beekeepers?</strong><br/>Yes, beekeeping is not a single gender activity. There are women supporting their families through beekeeping with Mama Buci. You can read our beekeeper stories on our website <a href=""http://mamabuci.com/meetthebeekeepers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mamabuci.com/meetthebeekeepers/</a></p>
<p><strong>How many hives do you have in the forest?</strong><br/>At the moment, we have over 105,000 hives in the Miombo forest.</p>
<p><strong>How many beekeepers and hives will you have in 5 years time?</strong><br/>We hope to be working with and helping 50,000 beekeepers, by 2022 which would mean that there would be 500,000 hives in the forest.  If Mama Buci can reach this target, we will be making it possible for 100,000 children to attend school on a daily basis (based on the average of 2 children per family attending).</p>
<p><strong>Why does Mama Buci not use Bark Hives?</strong><br/>We use top bar hives which are made from timber offcuts and manufacturing timber waste. This enables us to help preserve the forest and not damage the trees on which the wildlife, climate and villages depend upon for food &amp; shelter.  Unfortunately, bark hives destroy the trees and can leave the honey tainted.</p>
<p><strong>Who makes the hives?</strong><br/>Local carpenters are employed to build the hives that we give to beekeepers</p>
<p><strong>Do the children have to wear a uniform?</strong><br/>It is preferable for the children to wear a uniform, which we provide, as clothing can be expensive and is often hand me down so it helps them to feel that they belong </p>
<p><strong>What language are the children taught in?</strong><br/>English is deemed the national language, so we teach in English and the local language of Bemba.</p>
<p><strong>How many teachers are there at the school?</strong><br/>We currently have 12 teachers.</p>
<p><strong>What subjects are taught at school?</strong><br/>English, Maths, Geography, Reading &amp; Writing, </p>
<p><strong>Will Mama Buci help support more schools?</strong><br/>As part of our objectives we hope to be able contribute funds to Good Hope International so that they may build more schools within Zambia and bordering countries, to secure more opportunities in their future.</p>
<p><strong>When the honey is harvested are the bees killed?</strong><br/>No, we train our beekeepers on the importance of leaving the brood (Queen, Worker bees, Drones, eggs and larvae in tact) We only take the surplus honey and leave the bees within the hive.</p>
<p><strong>Will the honey crystallise and if it does what should I do?</strong><br/>All raw honey will crystallise over time. The crystallisation process is natural and does not mean that it is spoiled. Pure, raw and unheated honey has a natural tendency to crystallize over time with no effect on the honey other than colour and texture. If your honey should crystallise then stand the jar in warm water, in the airing cupboard or somewhere warm with an indirect heat and it will slowly return to a liquid. Don’t keep you honey in the fridge as this will accelerate the crystallisation process.</p>
<p><strong>What is cold pressed filtered honey?</strong><br/>The honey combe is pressed and then naturally filtered through sieves to separate the wax, any pollen or hive debris from the honey which runs through the sieve.</p>
<p><strong>Is the honey Organic?</strong><br/>Mama Buci honey is harvested from Virgin forests which has no pesticide use within it or on the land neighbouring the forest. Our honey has been certified organic in Zambia, it does not hold a Soil Association organic certificate at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Has Mama Buci honey won any awards?</strong><br/>Yes in 2014 it won a Great Taste Award. Great Taste, organised by the Guild of Fine Food, is the acknowledged benchmark for fine food and drink. It has been described as the ‘Oscars’ of the food world and the ‘epicurean equivalent of the Booker prize’. </p>

Bear Grylls
Hello! My name is Martin Zuch, founder of Mama Buci, a social enterprise. I want to share with you our exciting journey of how we have improved the quality of life of over 10,000 families by building over 150 bee hives a day, training beekeepers and harvesting tastebud tantalising ethical, cold pressed HONEY.

Before Mama Buci I was a Hedge Fund Manager but one day while I was enjoying the trappings of my success I realised that there had to be more to life than just making money.  I wanted to do more to help others in a philanthropic way and decided to focus my newfound commitment on the poorest communities in Africa . So I jacked in the day job and started my search for the best way to do this.
As with anything in life I tried and failed but I got back on my horse as I was determined not to give up on my mission.  It was essential to continue sustaining the school we had built as part the initial projects I had already started in the community.
It was then that my dear friend, John Enright, mentioned the potential of commercial bee keeping.  I threw myself at this new idea and created Mama Buci.  After a lot of time and investment we have finally been able to have a positive impact, helping over 10,000 families in Zambia!  But there is more to be done which is why I am here asking for your help!
Mama Buci has built over 105,000 beehives which provide a secure income for over 10,000 families.  But our ambition is much bigger than this.  By 2022 we want to have over 500,000 hives across the Zambian forest.  This would provide secure income for 50,000 families and provide education for over 100,000 children!  In fact, every single jar of delicious Mama Buci honey sold provides education and a meal for a child. 
I invite you to join me on the Mama Buci journey...and to play a part in the effort that will make a difference to the lives of thousands of people across Zambia!

 

Mama Buci honey is lovingly hand-harvested by over 10,000 trusted families in the virgin Miombo forests of Central Zambia. The amber, polyfloral, raw honey is produced from hive to bottle with no additives, preservatives, economic adulterants or other nasties.

We can’t take all the credit for its delicious taste though, as it’s the millions of bees that do most of the hard work. The African bees take their nectar and pollen from a rich variety of wildflowers in the Miombo forest that change from season to season. This is why we have two different types of honey, our summer and winter harvest.
The Summer Harvest has a light amber, floral taste with tantalising hints of aniseed and fennel. It’s earthy flavours make it a great accompaniment to cheese or other savoury foods.
The Winter Harvest has a rich, sweet, dark amber flavour with comforting hints of black treacle (molasses). It tastes scrumptious spread over toast, drizzled over yogurt or stirred in your favourite brew.


 

Beekeeping has been a popular income-generating activity in Zambia for centuries. However, most of the honey produced is kept in traditional bark hives, which involves a harvesting process that strips the bark from the tree ultimately leading to its death. This not only has a negative impact on the environment but also to the beekeepers income as the bees need to feed off the trees to produce honey.
This all changed however with the introduction of the top bar beehive which is where our delicious honey is created.  The top bar hive yields twice the amount of honey than the traditional bark hive and causes absolutely no damage to the trees and surrounding forest. 
After 2 years of struggling with technical problems involved with the beehives themselves my partner came up with the new design of the tree top bar hive. To our delight, the bees started to flourish, producing over 12kg of honey on average per hive in a structure that, if maintained properly, could last a lifetime. That’s when we knew we had found something with the potential to really make a difference.
Now we are building over 150 beehives a day, 5 days a week, in our local Zambian workshop. We have provided over 105,000 beehives which will produce over 400 tonnes of delicious raw honey this year alone.

 

Our focus starts with educating the beekeepers and families on how to work with their land to help maintain a healthy eco-system.  Mama Buci supports over 10,000 families in Zambia by providing them with beehives and beekeeper training needed to produce delicious raw honey that has a positive impact on the environment. In order to rebuild and invigorate impoverished communities, education is key, and that’s what is at the heart of the Mama Buci story.  Over the years we have watched communities, individuals and forests flourish.

 

 
In 2006 we set up the Luyando school in Kamafwesa which is now enjoyed by over 420 children and provides work for 11 local teachers. The school has made such a difference to the prospects of this community and our goal is to continue to support more schools as Mama Buci grows. As part of our vision to support education, we also set up the charity Give Hope International which manages and expands Mama Buci's educational aspirations which it is now doing in Zambia, Malawi and Ethiopa.

<p>Peanut butter: We’re nostalgic for it. Crack open a jar of peanut butter and BAM! Childhood is back!</p>
<p>On a sandwich, on some crackers, or straight off the spoon. Eating peanut butter is like inviting your childhood back in for a visit.</p>
<p>But did you know peanut butter can be shockingly unhealthy? Grab a jar from your pantry and look at the nutrition label. Surprised? Sugar, additives, preservatives, and chemicals.</p>
<p>We need<i>​ </i>to do better.</p>
<p>That’s where we come in. We are Natura and we believe that peanut butter can and should become something more than what it is. Something that we can snack on guilt-free, something that tastes delicious but is also as healthy as a bag of pure, roasted peanuts.</p>
<p>To that end, we've researched and developed Natura as a food product that uses the best natural ingredients to produce the best flavors we love and the healthfulness we need. Natura will produce the first Moringer Honey peanut Butter and eight other flavors including maple, crunchy, granola, cinnamon, honey, raisin, blueberries and strawberries</p>
<p>100% Natural</p>
<p>Made of 100% natural ingredients sourced in the USA, Natura is reliably wholesome. No chemicals. We believe food should consist of nothing but food. This may seem like common sense to you, but for many firms in the food industry, food is rarely <i>just</i> food. A large number of food products contain chemicals that no human should consume.</p>
<p>Nothing with the Natura label will ever contain chemicals.</p>
<p>Non-GMO</p>
<p>Our peanut butter is non-GMO, unlike the laboratory-tainted food products cluttering most grocery store shelves these days. For those of us who prefer to eat foods grown without<i>​</i>that technology, Natura offers an alternative peanut butter. Natura is bucking the trends that have persisted in the food sector for long enough. We are breaking out. We are making Natura the way that peanut butter should<i> be</i><i>.</i></p>
<p>Always Healthy, So Many Spreads</p>
<p>No trans fats</p>
<p>No added sugar</p>
<p>No preservatives</p>
<p>No Palm oils</p>
</div><div>
<p>Vegan</p>
<p>And Natura tastes wonderful!</p>
<p>At launch, we are introducing a series of flavors for our peanut butter, including:</p>
<ul><li>Peanut Butter Spread with Honey</li></ul>

<p><i><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></i></p>
<p>We need your help to raise the funds needed to produce, market, and distribute the initial flavors of Natura. Our fundraising goal for this campaign is $15,000, which will cover all of getting this groundbreaking peanut butter brand up and running. Any funds raised over this goal will be used for promotion and marketing.</p>
<p>And now the fun part! We are offering some exclusive rewards in exchange for your contributions, including early access to Natura. Be the first to try Natura!</p>

Peanut butter: We’re nostalgic for it. Crack open a jar of peanut butter and BAM! Childhood is back!
On a sandwich, on some crackers, or straight off the spoon. Eating peanut butter is like inviting your childhood back in for a visit.
But did you know peanut butter can be shockingly unhealthy? Grab a jar from your pantry and look at the nutrition label. Surprised? Sugar, additives, preservatives, and chemicals.
We need​ to do better.
That’s where we come in. We are Natura and we believe that peanut butter can and should become something more than what it is. Something that we can snack on guilt-free, something that tastes delicious but is also as healthy as a bag of pure, roasted peanuts.
To that end, we've researched and developed Natura as a food product that uses the best natural ingredients to produce the best flavors we love and the healthfulness we need. Natura will produce the first Moringer Honey peanut Butter and eight other flavors including maple, crunchy, granola, cinnamon, honey, raisin, blueberries and strawberries
100% Natural
Made of 100% natural ingredients sourced in the USA, Natura is reliably wholesome. No chemicals. We believe food should consist of nothing but food. This may seem like common sense to you, but for many firms in the food industry, food is rarely just food. A large number of food products contain chemicals that no human should consume.
Nothing with the Natura label will ever contain chemicals.
Non-GMO
Our peanut butter is non-GMO, unlike the laboratory-tainted food products cluttering most grocery store shelves these days. For those of us who prefer to eat foods grown without​that technology, Natura offers an alternative peanut butter. Natura is bucking the trends that have persisted in the food sector for long enough. We are breaking out. We are making Natura the way that peanut butter should be.
Always Healthy, So Many Spreads
No trans fats
No added sugar
No preservatives
No Palm oils

Vegan
And Natura tastes wonderful!
At launch, we are introducing a series of flavors for our peanut butter, including:
Peanut Butter Spread with Honey
 

Peanut Butter Crunchy
 

Peanut Butter Classic Creamy
 


 
 
Peanut Butter Spread with Moringa  and honey
 

Peanut Butter Spread with strawberry 
 

 
 
Peanut Butter blend with coconut
 

Peanut Butter blend with dates
 


Peanut Butter Spread with Maple Cinnamon
Peanut Butter Spread with Cinnamon Raisin
Peanut Butter Spread with Caramel Apple Pie
Peanut Butter Spread with Maple
Peanut Butter Spread with Chocolate Chips

We are also launching two almond butter flavors: Almond Butter Classic and Almond Butter Spread with Honey.
We have researched and developed these flavors. Now, we need your help bringing them to market.
What We Need & What You Get
We need your help to raise the funds needed to produce, market, and distribute the initial flavors of Natura. Our fundraising goal for this campaign is $15,000, which will cover all of getting this groundbreaking peanut butter brand up and running. Any funds raised over this goal will be used for promotion and marketing.
And now the fun part! We are offering some exclusive rewards in exchange for your contributions, including early access to Natura. Be the first to try Natura!

<h3>Mira Mira Coffee</h3>
<p>We are a neighborhood cafe in the heart of Savannah's growing art district, Starland. We are sisters who originally grew up in Washington State with an early and deep love of coffee, community, and music. Jessica is the artist with SCAD roots and is passionate about cultivating art and music in the city she convinced Amy to relocate to, not only to be close to family, but to experience the unique beauty and curiosity of our port city.  </p>
<p>After being here for almost a decade, we joined forces in the pursuit of adapting a space at the corner of 34th and Habersham St into a thriving neighborhood space. </p>
<p>Our goal is to expand on our coffee equipment, put the finishing touches on art and a mural, expand our hours, and expand what we can offer our neighborhood. This campaign will give us the ability to hire passionate people and provide a committed space for art, music, and creators. We are committed to working with local vendors and partnering with local companies, like Cup to Cup as a coffee roaster. We currently work with a local BBQ operation to offer a delicious lunch and dinner options with neighborhood friendly prices. We hope to expand into breakfast and brunch through this campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Campaign Goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The funding goal is $15,000 for an espresso machine, inventory, and expansion into 7 days a week of operations</li>
<li>The perks we are offering include locally printed apparel and coffee, we're working on sourcing diner mugs and coffee to-go cups to add later, as well as gift cards valued more than the original perk</li>
<li>All of the artwork and designs are done by SCAD students and local artists</li>
<li>All of the printing is from a local screen printing shop</li>
<li>The mural will empower a local artist </li>
<li>When we reach our goal, we will be able to offer the neighborhood a place to study and work remotely, as well as a meeting place, a presentation place, and opportunity for artists to showcase their art and music</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With rebranding a space and brining in a new team and new direction, we have laid the foundation and consistency to grow, but need your help to get there. We have our launch team in place and have been operating for 3 months under our structure and brand. Our small team is committed to core values that include quality, compassion, and fostering a place for creativity. </p>
<ul>
<li>To complete our space, we need to bring in more coffee options and expand into earlier hours</li>
<li>We have local roasters who are excited for our expansion and are already committed to starting to do new coffee cuppings and events with us</li>
<li>If we don't reach our complete goal, we will start with bringing in more robust coffee equipment and an espresso machine</li>
<li>The ability to offer a professional and bright space for students and remote workers to come to daily is our primary goal, we already have strong wi-fi and a lot of long window, bar and low seating with built-in USB and outlets every couple feet. </li>

<h3>***New stretch goal of $50,000. See update.***</h3>
<p>(We are so grateful that we met our original goal of $25,000 on the first day! <strong>Thank you!!!</strong> Because of all of your support, we have made a stretch goal for ourselves. The additional $25K will allow us to get our 500 gallon copper pot still from Germany set up in Portland. The kind folks at Aria Gin have been letting us use their still - for which we are so grateful - but we'd like to get our own up and running by February. Thank you for continuing to spread the word!)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Welcome to Freeland Spirits. Freeland is named after my Meemaw Freeland, who never touched a drop of booze in her life but taught me that all good things come from scratch. And that women can be anything they want.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>Freeland Spirits celebrates the women of the craft. From the gals who grow the grain to those who run the still, we are creating superior spirits that will feature the very best that the Pacific Northwest has to offer.</h3>
<p>The minute I first walked into a distillery, my future was sealed. The flavor of the spirits, the rich smell of the barrels, the beauty of all the grain and botanicals, and the dedication of the distillers in creating unique, craft spirits, drew me in from the moment I walked through the distillery doors. </p>
<p>Cory Carman and I always drink whiskey together when she comes to Portland. Cory hails from Joseph, Oregon, where she is the owner of the century ranch, Carman Ranch.  Over one of our whiskey sessions, I disclosed to Cory my distilling dream. She said, “Let's do it. I’ll grow your grain.” This spring Cory will plant her first crop of rye for Freeland Spirits. Cory’s crop rotation plan involves using beef and pork to fertilize the soil and help create the most flavorful grain.</p>

<p>What if ranches across Oregon were doing the same thing? Rather than letting acres go fallow, plant a crop that not only regenerates the soil but also produces value. And isn’t whiskey the most value added form of grain you could ever dream of? We will partner with other Oregon farmers to grow heritage corn varieties for our bourbon and juniper for our gin. Spirits created with these flavorful local ingredients will express the unique terroir of Oregon in every precious sip.</p>
<p>Along with our whiskey, we will make other spirits that invoke the very spirit of Oregon. One of those spirits is gin.</p>
<p>And let me tell you about the gin. Oh, the gin. Molly has spent years tinkering with botanicals to create the perfect gin. And today the very first full batch is coming off the still. Nothing about the process is simple. But simple wasn’t our goal. Our goal was a beautiful balanced gin that uses fresh ingredients and tastes like the best of Meemaw’s garden.</p>

<p>We use traditional heat distillation with 14 botanicals, including juniper. We are also using a unique piece of equipment called a rotovap. The rotovap is essentially a vacuum still that can distill much more delicate flavors that can’t survive heat distillation. Fresh cucumber, mint, rosemary, thyme, and honey are distilled using the rotovap. We’re purchasing these ingredients from local farmers right now, but in the future we want to grow them ourselves, even adding honeybees to the roof of the distillery. What is produced with heat distillation is then married with the rotovap process to create the most perfect gin that tastes like no other you’ve ever tried. Spirits aficionado and writer Natalie Brant says, “The best way I can describe it is like you’re lying in the sun next to a patch of cucumbers in the middle of a juniper forest. It’s glorious.” Beautiful in cocktails but I also love it with just a cube of ice.</p>

<p>Our goal is to raise $25,000.

(We are so grateful that we met our original goal of $25,000 on the first day! Thank you!!! Because of all of your support, we have made a stretch goal for ourselves. The additional $25K will allow us to get our 500 gallon copper pot still from Germany set up in Portland. The kind folks at Aria Gin have been letting us use their still - for which we are so grateful - but we'd like to get our own up and running by February. Thank you for continuing to spread the word!)
 
Welcome to Freeland Spirits. Freeland is named after my Meemaw Freeland, who never touched a drop of booze in her life but taught me that all good things come from scratch. And that women can be anything they want.

Freeland Spirits celebrates the women of the craft. From the gals who grow the grain to those who run the still, we are creating superior spirits that will feature the very best that the Pacific Northwest has to offer.
The minute I first walked into a distillery, my future was sealed. The flavor of the spirits, the rich smell of the barrels, the beauty of all the grain and botanicals, and the dedication of the distillers in creating unique, craft spirits, drew me in from the moment I walked through the distillery doors. 
Cory Carman and I always drink whiskey together when she comes to Portland.

<h3>Bierbrauen ist unsere Leidenschaft</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dieses Projekt ist eine Idee von Sam und Luis, die im vergangenen Jahr eine 8HL (800 Liter)-Brauerei in Berlin-Moabit gebaut haben und eine überwältigend positive Resonanz erhielten. Sie trafen sich bei einem Braumeister-Zertifizierungskurs der Versuchs- und Lehranstalt für Brauerei in Berlin (VLB). Die VLB wurde vom Craft Beer &amp; Brewing Magazine als <a href=""https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/uxn9BY8j1A/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">weltweiter Pionier in der Brauwissenschaft</a> ausgezeichnet.</li>
<li>Wir haben bereits über 30 neue Biere kreiert. In diesem Jahr wollen wir expandieren und haben eine Lokalität gefunden, die derzeit für diesen Expansionsplan reserviert und bereits mit dem Ort verbunden ist, an dem wir jetzt brauen. Der Tastingroom ermöglicht uns direkt mit unseren Kunden, Kollegen, Brauereien und Studenten zu kommunizieren. Es geht hier nicht nur um Bier.  Bei diesem Konzept geht es darum, unsere Ideen durch Entwicklung, Ausbildung und Forschung in Ihr Glas zu bringen und wirklich leidenschaftliche Menschen zu fördern, außergewöhnliche Produkte herauszubringen und Spaß daran zu haben! </li>
<li>Als Brauer glauben wir, dass die leidenschaftlichen und engagierten Menschen hinter den lokalen Brauereien in Berlin es verdienen, zu glänzen. Kleine Brauereien haben einen großen Einfluss auf ihre Umgebung. Sie bieten Arbeitsplätze, kulturelle Verbindungen und stellen in Notfällen Ressourcen für Bedürftige bereit.  Wir wollen einen Raum schaffen, in dem wir alle die guten Dinge des Lebens genießen können. DAS ist Bier, oder?! Mit jeder Spende für dieses Projekt hilfst Du uns und vielen anderen leidenschaftlichen Menschen, dem Traum näher zu kommen, die Berliner Brauereiszene zu einem weltweit zentralen Anlaufpunkt zu machen.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Was wir brauchen &amp; was Du dafür bekommst</h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Ziele</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bau eines Tastingrooms in Berlin. Wir möchten 12-15 Zapfhähne für unsere eigenen Biere und 2-5 Zapfhähne für Gastbiere installieren. Eine einzigartige Atmosphäre und lokal gebrautes Bier. <br/> </li>
<li>Erweiterung des Lager-, Kühl- und Gärraums der Brauerei, um dem Wachstum von mehr als dem Dreifachen der Produktion von 144.000 Litern pro Jahr gerecht zu werden.<br/> </li>
<li>Erweiterung unseres Fassreifungsprogramms, damit wir ein wichtiger Akteur in der Kategorie Sauerbier und Fassbier werden.<br/> </li>
<li><p>Unseren Chefbrauer Sam einstellen. Über 2 Jahre hat er für das Projekt gesorgt und wahrscheinlich isst gerade einen Teil des Getreides in der Brauerei, um an dieser Stelle am Leben zu bleiben.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Das Geld, das Du für diese Kampagne spendest, wird für den Ausbau unserer Aktivitäten verwendet, damit wir Dosen produzieren und an den Großhandel verkaufen können, der unsere Reichweite erhöht und wir auch weiterhin lokal und nachhaltig in Berlin produzieren.</p>
<p>Was passiert, wenn wir unser Ziel erreichen?</p>
<p>Wenn wir unser Ziel erreichen, können wir die schönen Räumlichkeiten, die wir uns bereits gesichert haben, ausbauen. Es ist geplant, den Tastingroom Anfang nächsten Jahres zu eröffnen. So haben wir Zeit, um die Finanzierung zu sichern und unseren Plan umzusetzen. Wir können uns auch einige kleine Brauerei-Upgrades leisten, um unser Bier frisch in der neuen Brauerei zu brauen.</p>
<p>Dieses Ziel zu erreichen, würde für uns alles radikal verändern. Wir werden endlich einen Raum haben, um unsere Produkte zu präsentieren! Natürlich wissen wir bereits, was wir damit machen würden. Dies ist der wichtigste Meilenstein, der unseren 3-Jahresplan in die Tat umsetzt. Eine weitere großartige Nachricht ist, dass wir bereits mit der Produktion von Dosen begonnen haben, so dass Du uns an immer mehr Orten sehen und unsere Biere käuflich erwerben kannst. Dieses Programm wird erweitert: Wir haben eine ""artists series"" gestartet, die Kunst aus aller Welt präsentiert. Schau` Dir unsere Finanzierungsvorteile an, um an diesem Programm teilnehmen zu können!</p>
<p>All dies sind wichtige Schritte auf dem Weg zu unserem ganz besonderen Ziel: Den ersten Tastingroom in Berlin zu eröffnen, der ausschließlich Bier aus heimischen Brauereien anbietet.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Die Auswirkungen</h3>
<p>Unsere Kampagne zielt darauf ab, ein tolles Produkt aus der Produktion direkt in Deine Hände zu bringen. Dein Beitrag wird den Unterschied machen, ob wir das scheinbar Unmögliche gegen die Bierriesen schaffen. Das Wachstumspotenzial ist unser größtes Kapital. Wir haben den Raum zu wachsen; wir brauchen nur die Mittel, um dorthin zu gelangen.</p>
<ul>
<li>In den ersten 4 Monaten unserer Geschäftstätigkeit haben wir mit einer sehr geringen Marge den Break-Even erreicht. Rekordverdächtig für eine Brauerei unserer Größe.  In diesem Jahr konnten wir konsequent die Gewinnschwelle erreichen und den Vertrieb außerhalb Deutschlands bis nach Kopenhagen ausbauen.</li>
<li>Wir sind Branchenexperten, die mit Deiner Hilfe eine Community aufbauen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hier sind einige unserer bisherigen Erfolge in diesem Jahr:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wir haben über 30 Biersorten gebraut.</li>
<li>Ankauf und Nachkäufe durch über 30 Bars und Restaurants, nur in Berlin.</li>
<li>Gesicherte Auftragsbrauereien unterstützen uns, indem wir ihre Biere brauen und beweisen, dass wir uns der Gemeinschaft verpflichtet fühlen, nicht egoistisch handeln sondern die Community fördern.</li>
<li>Durchführung von Bildungsprogrammen in den folgenden Kategorien: Off-Aromen aus Bier- oder Zapfanlagen und wie man sie identifiziert (Cicerone Certification Preparation), Keg-Handling, Zapfhahnkalibrierungen, Karbonisierungsmanagement, Leitungsreinigung und Installation.</li>
<li>Wir haben über 20.000 € an Produkten und Dienstleistungen verkauft.</li>
<li>Begonnene Exporte.</li>
<li>Wir haben an über einem Dutzend Veranstaltungen teilgenommen, Tendenz steigend.</li>
<li>Belieferung zahlreicher Unternehmensveranstaltungen und sogar einen Deal mit einem lokalen Friseurladen, der unser Bier frisch gezapft anbietet.</li>
<li>Wir haben einen Vertriebsleiter beauftragt, der den Vertrieb übernommen hat und unsere Kunden betreut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unsere Einbar Brauerei Familie ist größer geworden, als wir es je erwartet hätten. Ohne Deine Liebe und Unterstützung wäre Einbar nicht dort, wo es heute ist. Wir sind für immer dankbar und motiviert, weiterhin unseren Teil dazu beizutragen und der Gemeinschaft etwas zurückzugeben. Mit Deiner Hilfe werden wir mit einer noch größeren Familie teilen können!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risiken &amp; Herausforderungen</h3>
<p>Wie immer bei einem Unternehmen wie diesem gibt es auch Risiken, aber wir haben einen Plan zum Erfolg! Hier ist unsere SWOT-Analyse und wie wir mit jedem potenziellen Risiko umgehen werden:</p>
<ul>
<li>In erster Linie geht es darum, Mittel für einen Tastingroom und eine kleine Erweiterung zu sichern. Der Ausbauplan wird erst nach Beginn des Tastingrooms berücksichtigt. Hierfür ist die Eröffnung der Räumlichkeiten unerlässlich - für unsere Sichtbarkeit und Gemeinschaftspräsenz.</li>
<li>Wir müssen auch die Finanzierung sichern, um unseren Braumeister (aus den USA) einzustellen und dadurch sicherzustellen, dass er weiterhin erstaunliche Biere für uns braut. Um diese Ziele zu erreichen, sind wir auch auf der Suche nach Investoren und einem Bankkredit. Bei Interesse kontaktiere uns bitte direkt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Die Marktveränderungen sind minimal und stellen hier kein großes Risiko dar. Im Allgemeinen ist das globale Craft-Bier auf dem Vormarsch. Hier sind einige nützliche Links, die uns helfen zu erklären, warum wir uns entschieden haben, in Berlin zu brauen.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.brauer-bund.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.brauer-bund.de</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wie wir diese Herausforderungen bewältigen werden</p>
<p>Wir beginnen damit, unsere Risiken einzuschätzen indem wir sagen, dass uns eine einzigartige Freundschaft verbindet und wir angesichts aller Widrigkeiten ein gutes Team und agil sind. Die Art und Weise, wie man seine Situation betrachtet, ist wichtig. Unsere langjährige Erfahrung hilft uns, unseren Horizont zu erweitern, wenn wir mit ""verschlossenen Türen"" oder Misserfolgen konfrontiert werden. Wir sind Unternehmer mit Millionen von Ideen. Wir haben einen Plan für alles (gut oder schlecht), um den Erfolg zu sichern und unsere Träume, Wünsche und Ideen umzusetzen.</p>
<p>Kommunikation ist ein mächtiges Werkzeug. Die aktive Kontaktaufnahme zu allen, die zuhören, ist unsere Lösung für einige dieser Risiken. Wir sind so weit gekommen, weil wir stets um Hilfe und Rat bitten. Unsere Egos können die Schläge ertragen, wenn sie kommen. </p>
<p>Was passiert also, wenn wir unser Ziel nicht erreichen?</p>
<p>Kein Problem. Wir werden das tun, was wir bereits erfolgreich getan haben.  Wir sind leidenschaftlich genug, um uns mit dem zufrieden zu geben, was uns gegeben wird. Wir werden weiterhin Spaß daran haben was wir tun - leidenschaftlich Bier brauen und mit einer größeren Familie als bisher zurückkehren. Wir werden weitermachen, bis wir die Wirkung erzielen können, die wir uns vorgenommen haben. Kurz gesagt: Wir werden das Geld verwenden, um so weit wie möglich zu kommen und nie aufgeben.</p>

<h3><strong>Brewing beer is our passion</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>This project is the brainchild of Sam and Luis, who last year built an 8HL(800 Liter) brewery in Moabit Berlin, and received an overwhelmingly positive response. They met each other during an intensive Brewmaster Certification course offered by Versuchs- und Lehranstalt für Brauerei in Berlin (VLB). VLB was named as a <a href=""https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/uxn9BY8j1A/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">global pioneer in brew science</a> by Craft Beer &amp; Brewing magazine.</li>
<li>We have already created over 30 new beers, and this year we plan to continue the growth into a larger space currently reserved for this expansion plan, and already connected to where they brew now. It's important to have the space to interact directly with our customers, fellow breweries, and students. This is not just about beer.  This concept is about surging our ideas to your glass through development, education, and research. It's about funding truly passionate people, putting out exceptional products, and having fun doing it!  </li>
<li>As brewers, we believe that the passionate and dedicated people behind the local breweries in Berlin deserve to shine. Small breweries have a large impact on their surrounding community. They provide job opportunities, cultural connections and in emergencies, provide resources for the needy.  We want to create a space for all of us to enjoy the good things in life. That's just beer, right? By donating to this project you are helping us, and many other passionate people, get closer to the dream of making Berlin one of the greatest cities for beer in the world.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build a taproom in Berlin. We are currently looking to create a unique craft beer taproom featuring our beers, as well as guest beers that are brewed locally. We would like 12-15 taps. 2-5 guest taps. A unique atmosphere and locally brewed beer. If you know the perfect place., please contact us. </li>
<li>Expand the brewery storage, refrigeration, and fermentation space to accommodate the growth of over 3 times the production totaling 144,000 liters annually. </li>
<li>Expand our barrel-aging program to enable us to become a major player in the sour beer and barrel-aged beer category.</li>
<li>Hire our head brewer Sam. Who has given over 2 years to the project and is probably currently eating some of the grain in the brewery to stay alive at this point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The money you donate to this campaign will be used to expand our operations, allowing us to produce cans and sell to the wholesale space expanding our reach and continue to locally and sustainably produce in Berlin.</p>
<p>What happens when we reach our goal?</p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we will be able to put together the beautiful taproom we have already secured. The plan is to open this taproom early next year. So we have plenty of time to secure funding and implement our plan. We can also afford some small brewery upgrades that will allow us to get our beer fresh, alongside others, into our future space. </p>
<p>Hitting this goal would radically transform everything for us. We will finally have a space to show off our products! Of course, we already know what we would do with it. This is the major milestone that turns our 3-year stretch goal into a reality. Some other great news is we have already begun production of cans, so you will be able to start seeing us in more and more locations. This program will expand as we have already started an ""artists series"" that features art from all over the world. Check out our perks to see if you can be part of this program!</p>
<p>Reaching this goal is a major step towards our final goal in opening the first-ever, community-focused bar in Berlin, strictly serving beer produced by local breweries.<br/> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our campaign is aimed at bringing a great product from production directly into your hands. Your contribution will make the difference in achieving the seemingly impossible, against the beer giants. High-growth potential is our strongest asset. We have the space to grow; we just need the funds to get us there. </p>
<ul>
<li>In our first 4 months of operations, we came within a very small margin from breaking even. Record-breaking for a brewery our size.  This year, we have been able to consistently break-even and have expanded distribution outside Germany as far as Copenhagen. </li>
<li>We are industry professionals who will build a community with your help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of our accomplishments so far this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brewed over 30 beers styles of beer.</li>
<li>Purchased and repurchased by over 30 bars and restaurants, just in Berlin.</li>
<li>Secured contract breweries support by brewing their beers and proving our dedication to the community is not selfish.</li>
<li>Held educational programs in the following categories: Off flavors from beer or tap systems and how to identify them(Cicerone Certification Preparation), keg handling, tap calibrations, carbonation management, line cleaning, and installation.</li>
<li>Sold over 20k in products and services.</li>
<li>Started exports.</li>
<li>Participated in over a dozen events, and counting.</li>
<li>Secured numerous software corporate events, and even a deal with a local Barber Shop to have beer on tap.</li>
<li>Hired a sales manager to take over sales and deliver for all accounts. <br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As always with a business like this, there are huge risks, but we have a plan to succeed! Here is our SWOT analysis and how we will tackle each potential risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, to secure funds for a taproom and a small expansion. The expansion plan is our stretch goal and will be considered only after starting a taproom. The taproom is essential for our visibility and community presence. </li>
<li>We must also secure funding to employ our brewer (From the states) and ensure he continues to brew amazing beers for us. We are also looking for ownership investors and a bank loan to accomplish these goals. If you are interested please contact us directly. </li>
</ul>
<p>Time - We have a little time currently as the building we are currently occupying is under construction and our landlords are fully aware of our plans to take over the entire 200Sqmt property. We are already looking for a taproom location and hope to acquire that before the end of this campaign. </p>
<p>Market change is minimal and not much of a risk here. In general, global craft beer is on the rise. Here are some useful links we have found that help explain why we decided to build in Berlin.</p>
<p><a href=""https://brewersofeurope.org/site/countries/figures.php?doc_id=674"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://brewersofeurope.org/site/countries/figu...</a></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.brauer-bund.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.brauer-bund.de</a><br/> </p>
<h3>How we will battle these challenges</h3>
<p>We can start assessing our risks by stating that we have a unique friendship with an outlook to be agile in the face of adversity. The way you look at a situation is important. Our depth of experience helps us expand our minds when faced with roadblocks or failures. We are entrepreneurs with millions of ideas. We have a plan for everything (good or bad) to ensure success. </p>
<p>Communication is a powerful tool. Reaching out to everyone who will listen is our solution to some of these risks. We didn't get this far without reaching out and asking for help or advice. Our egos can take the blows when they come.  </p>
<p>So what happens if we don't meet our goal?</p>
<p>No problem. We'll do what we've done successfully.  We are passionate enough to make do with whatever we are graciously given. We will keep enjoying what we do and return with a bigger family than before and pinch our pennies. We will persevere until we can make the impact we set out to make in the first place. In short, we will use the money to get as far as we can, and never give up. <br/> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, we understand, but that doesn't mean they can't help!</p>
<p>Please like, share, enjoy a beer on us, or just send us love! We could not do any of these things without you. Thank you!</p>

Die Art und Weise, wie man seine Situation betrachtet, ist wichtig. Unsere langjährige Erfahrung hilft uns, unseren Horizont zu erweitern, wenn wir mit ""verschlossenen Türen"" oder Misserfolgen konfrontiert werden. Wir sind Unternehmer mit Millionen von Ideen. Wir haben einen Plan für alles (gut oder schlecht), um den Erfolg zu sichern und unsere Träume, Wünsche und Ideen umzusetzen.
Kommunikation ist ein mächtiges Werkzeug. Die aktive Kontaktaufnahme zu allen, die zuhören, ist unsere Lösung für einige dieser Risiken. Wir sind so weit gekommen, weil wir stets um Hilfe und Rat bitten. Unsere Egos können die Schläge ertragen, wenn sie kommen. 
Was passiert also, wenn wir unser Ziel nicht erreichen?
Kein Problem. Wir werden das tun, was wir bereits erfolgreich getan haben.  Wir sind leidenschaftlich genug, um uns mit dem zufrieden zu geben, was uns gegeben wird. Wir werden weiterhin Spaß daran haben was wir tun - leidenschaftlich Bier brauen und mit einer größeren Familie als bisher zurückkehren. Wir werden weitermachen, bis wir die Wirkung erzielen können, die wir uns vorgenommen haben. Kurz gesagt: Wir werden das Geld verwenden, um so weit wie möglich zu kommen und nie aufgeben.

Andere Möglichkeiten, wie Sie helfen können
Einige Leute können uns nicht finanziell unterstützen, das verstehen wir. Aber sie können uns trotzdem tatkräftig unterstützen!

Das Einbar Team
 
Brewing beer is our passion

This project is the brainchild of Sam and Luis, who last year built an 8HL(800 Liter) brewery in Moabit Berlin, and received an overwhelmingly positive response. They met each other during an intensive Brewmaster Certification course offered by Versuchs- und Lehranstalt für Brauerei in Berlin (VLB). VLB was named as a global pioneer in brew science by Craft Beer & Brewing magazine.
We have already created over 30 new beers, and this year we plan to continue the growth into a larger space currently reserved for this expansion plan, and already connected to where they brew now. It's important to have the space to interact directly with our customers, fellow breweries, and students. This is not just about beer.  This concept is about surging our ideas to your glass through development, education, and research. It's about funding truly passionate people, putting out exceptional products, and having fun doing it!  
As brewers, we believe that the passionate and dedicated people behind the local breweries in Berlin deserve to shine. Small breweries have a large impact on their surrounding community. They provide job opportunities, cultural connections and in emergencies, provide resources for the needy.  We want to create a space for all of us to enjoy the good things in life. That's just beer, right? By donating to this project you are helping us, and many other passionate people, get closer to the dream of making Berlin one of the greatest cities for beer in the world. 

What We Need & What You Get
Goals

Build a taproom in Berlin. We are currently looking to create a unique craft beer taproom featuring our beers, as well as guest beers that are brewed locally. We would like 12-15 taps. 2-5 guest taps. A unique atmosphere and locally brewed beer. If you know the perfect place., please contact us. 
Expand the brewery storage, refrigeration, and fermentation space to accommodate the growth of over 3 times the production totaling 144,000 liters annually. 
Expand our barrel-aging program to enable us to become a major player in the sour beer and barrel-aged beer category.
Hire our head brewer Sam. Who has given over 2 years to the project and is probably currently eating some of the grain in the brewery to stay alive at this point.

The money you donate to this campaign will be used to expand our operations, allowing us to produce cans and sell to the wholesale space expanding our reach and continue to locally and sustainably produce in Berlin.
What happens when we reach our goal?
If we reach our goal, we will be able to put together the beautiful taproom we have already secured. The plan is to open this taproom early next year. So we have plenty of time to secure funding and implement our plan. We can also afford some small brewery upgrades that will allow us to get our beer fresh, alongside others, into our future space. 
Hitting this goal would radically transform everything for us. We will finally have a space to show off our products! Of course, we already know what we would do with it. This is the major milestone that turns our 3-year stretch goal into a reality. Some other great news is we have already begun production of cans, so you will be able to start seeing us in more and more locations. This program will expand as we have already started an ""artists series"" that features art from all over the world. Check out our perks to see if you can be part of this program!
Reaching this goal is a major step towards our final goal in opening the first-ever, community-focused bar in Berlin, strictly serving beer produced by local breweries. 
The Impact
Our campaign is aimed at bringing a great product from production directly into your hands. Your contribution will make the difference in achieving the seemingly impossible, against the beer giants. High-growth potential is our strongest asset. We have the space to grow; we just need the funds to get us there. 

In our first 4 months of operations, we came within a very small margin from breaking even. Record-breaking for a brewery our size.  This year, we have been able to consistently break-even and have expanded distribution outside Germany as far as Copenhagen. 
We are industry professionals who will build a community with your help.

Here are some of our accomplishments so far this year:

Brewed over 30 beers styles of beer.
Purchased and repurchased by over 30 bars and restaurants, just in Berlin.
Secured contract breweries support by brewing their beers and proving our dedication to the community is not selfish.
Held educational programs in the following categories: Off flavors from beer or tap systems and how to identify them(Cicerone Certification Preparation), keg handling, tap calibrations, carbonation management, line cleaning, and installation.
Sold over 20k in products and services.
Started exports.
Participated in over a dozen events, and counting.
Secured numerous software corporate events, and even a deal with a local Barber Shop to have beer on tap.
Hired a sales manager to take over sales and deliver for all accounts.  

Risks & Challenges
As always with a business like this, there are huge risks, but we have a plan to succeed! Here is our SWOT analysis and how we will tackle each potential risk:

First and foremost, to secure funds for a taproom and a small expansion. The expansion plan is our stretch goal and will be considered only after starting a taproom. The taproom is essential for our visibility and community presence. 
We must also secure funding to employ our brewer (From the states) and ensure he continues to brew amazing beers for us. We are also looking for ownership investors and a bank loan to accomplish these goals. If you are interested please contact us directly. 

Time - We have a little time currently as the building we are currently occupying is under construction and our landlords are fully aware of our plans to take over the entire 200Sqmt property. We are already looking for a taproom location and hope to acquire that before the end of this campaign. 
Market change is minimal and not much of a risk here. In general, global craft beer is on the rise. Here are some useful links we have found that help explain why we decided to build in Berlin.

https://www.brauer-bund.de 
How we will battle these challenges
We can start assessing our risks by stating that we have a unique friendship with an outlook to be agile in the face of adversity. The way you look at a situation is important. Our depth of experience helps us expand our minds when faced with roadblocks or failures. We are entrepreneurs with millions of ideas. We have a plan for everything (good or bad) to ensure success. 
Communication is a powerful tool. Reaching out to everyone who will listen is our solution to some of these risks. We didn't get this far without reaching out and asking for help or advice. Our egos can take the blows when they come.  
So what happens if we don't meet our goal?
No problem. We'll do what we've done successfully.  We are passionate enough to make do with whatever we are graciously given. We will keep enjoying what we do and return with a bigger family than before and pinch our pennies. We will persevere until we can make the impact we set out to make in the first place. In short, we will use the money to get as far as we can, and never give up.  
Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, we understand, but that doesn't mean they can't help!
Please like, share, enjoy a beer on us, or just send us love! We could not do any of these things without you. Thank you!

<h3>Short Summary of this unique Flavour Enhancing Machine</h3>
<p>My name is Ian Boake, I am an electrical and electronics engineer and love helping people to make things at home which makes their lives much easier and saves them money. I started by making my own food dehumidifier using an incandescent lamp and a desktop fan, that unit I called '<i>Revision 1</i>' back in 2016. I showed a few fellows at work (Western Power in Western Australia)  and we started a friendly competition to see who could make the best tasting Beef Biltong (Biltong is remarkably like Beef Jerky, but uses different spices). I have a blog showing all the electronics systems I have worked on over the last couple of years, all geared toward making your life easier: <a href=""http://www.ianboake.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ianboake.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have since refined the concept over the last 4 years and now want to put it into full production, this is '<i>Revision 12</i>' of the original concept based on many people's feedback.  It has a <strong>Bluetooth interface</strong> to set-up the Wi-Fi connection to your local router, all of which is cleared illustrated within the supplied instruction booklet and much easier than anything that we have seen on the market.  The controller then serves a intuitive webpage that can be viewed on your mobile device for monitoring the process - ""the recipe"", as it were. The recipe book tells you what to watch for on the webpage, no matter whether you are making Beef/Venison Jerky, Fruit Leathers, Biltong or Dried Fruit.... </p>
<p>There is also a convenient adjustment knob which  allows you to adjust the heat engine output based on which  enclosure size you have attached it to. The heat engine is simply attached to your enclosure with four little screws and nuts that we supply  (the manual guides you on which setting is best for which delicacy). It is so simple!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The aspect of this system that I hope appeals to people is that by dehydrating meat with that great umami flavour - owing due to our unique Bluetooth <strong><i>Flavour control</i></strong> system they saves heaps of cash!! Fruit and vegetables etc may also be done and then these dried foodstuffs then no longer leads to waste or the rather exorbitant costs of buying these delicious items from retailers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jerky or Biltong lovers can spend thousands of $$$ dollars a year, and why when it is so simple to do it at home using the Billies 1000 unit and recipe book.  More importantly the foods really taste delicious!! We provide a free recipe book on how to set the controller to get the best tasting foods from 4 years of experimentation and which spices to use... The controller can get the best <strong><i>umami </i></strong>flavour for Beef Jerky, Salami, or Beef Biltong from hundreds of hours of testing various set-points.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why this campaign? If we can set-up a production line for these <i>Billies-1000 DIY systems</i> we can get more units out to people all over the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can see one of these working bees where I helped a group of folks to make their own dehumidifiers, this was a previous version of the unit as compared to the unit that this campaign is about. This latest unit is very much orientated towards much quicker deployment in around only 10 minutes with no electrical wiring required!!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
</div><div><ul>
<li>The input materials for the units and production workshop to fabricate these units in volumes (1000 per month), will cost about $45,000 and is what we need to really get going.</li>
<li>We will get people the first large volume produced units at 25% off the usual list price!</li>
<li>If we don't reach the full goal, we will still make the units, it will however take longer to get them out as our current process has insufficient automation to do volumes.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Saving Beef Jerky, Beef Biltong or Dried-fruit lovers, thousands of dollars a year, by empowering them to make these great treats themselves at home!</li>
<li>These units could also potentially be used by people around the world to dehumidify their farmed fruits and sell higher-value items without the need for refrigeration.</li>
<li>It also gives one of the best <i>umami favours</i> for Beef Jerky, Salami and Biltong, which are traditional foods for many nations (although going by different names). Your contribution allows us to produce a higher volume of these units, thus helping more people and putting the best <i>umami flavours </i>into homemade Jerky, Biltong using the tested set-points from our very own <i>Recipe book</i>.</li>
<li><strong>We have also learnt an incredible trick which we reveal in the recipe book to keep the original flavours of dried fruit - these thereby tasting much better than what comes out of conventional dehumidifiers!</strong></li>
<li>I am a professional electrical engineer with nearly 30 year's service to various industries and have thus made sure these units are completely safe with certified components (safe if used according to our instructions provided). We also made an amazingly simple Bluetooth user interface where you send a letter to the controller and it responds accordingly. We also tested it with a few young folks to ensure that it is easy to use and follow. </li>
<li>Everybody who has tried these units, raves about how easy it is to use and how delicious the dehydrated (desiccated) foods are, especially since they are now able to make these at home thereby saving them heaps of cash $$$.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The key risk here is that this product is not successfully scaled to get it out to a broader group across the world. We will however still make low volume units.</p>
<ul>
<li>The production process to scale is well understood in terms of injection moulding and printed circuit board production using a reflow oven etc.</li>
<li>The required equipment has been identified and a raw material supply chain already set-up and needs to be scaled-up to feed the higher volume production process.</li>

<p><strong>Cinder</strong> is a countertop grill with the <strong>precision of sous-vide</strong> and the <strong>power of a stovetop</strong>. With grill plates that stay within <strong>1 degree</strong> of your <strong>food's ideal temperature</strong>, Cinder provides edge-to-edge cooking with no temperature fluctuations — and it brings this <strong>precision to high-temperature searing</strong> too!</p>
<p>Order your Cinder through this campaign to get a discounted price and avoid waiting an extra 6-8 months before it hits stores. </p>
<p>You are already accustomed to making consistently incredible meals with sous vide. </p>
<p>But sous vide prep and clean-up <strong>take too much time</strong> (e.g. water baths, vacuum sealing, plastic bags, firing up the stove afterward). <strong>Cinder’s here to make sous vide faster, more versatile, and easier to use. </strong></p>
<p>The results have <strong>professional</strong> <strong>chefs</strong> and <strong>sous vide aficionados </strong>alike calling Cinder<strong> <i>revolutionary</i>. </strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BQIDlxtj9Z6/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chef Kenji</a> made the world’s best grilled cheese on Cinder.

<p>Dial in a temperature or pair Cinder with the mobile app (Android version coming soon). The <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cinder-precision-grill/id1126533066?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">app</a> automatically reads the thickness of your food (from Cinder) and tells you how long it'll take to cook. Cool, right?</p>
<p>No need for checking in or constant flipping. The temperature inside Cinder is so tightly controlled that you could leave it sitting inside Cinder for an additional 2 hours and your food still wouldn't overcook.</p>
<p>This is truly set-it-and-forget-it. If you don't regularly have the time to cook — or cook <i>well</i> — Cinder is the last kitchen appliance you'll ever need.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Whether it's a beep from the grill or a notification from the optional Cinder app, you'll be told when your food is done cooking — without you having to check.</p>
<p>Next, you can either let it sit at the target temperature and carry on with your other tasks. Or, you can switch Cinder into <strong>searing mode</strong>. In 45 seconds, you'll have a restaurant-quality sear with a deliciously caramelized exterior.</p>

<p>Precise temperature — not cooking time — is everything when it comes to cooking great food. Other appliances simply don’t have uniform temperatures across their surface. Steak dries out, salmon cooks unevenly, and you're left with food that’s mediocre unless you stressfully nail timing within 15-30s.</p>
<p>Cinder gets around this by using tiny heating nodes that continuously turn on and off to ensure every millimeter (literally) is at the correct temperature. This precision changes home cooking — no more monitoring and adjusting temperature every few minutes. Instead, work on your side dishes and talk with your family.</p>
<p>This is sous-vide cooking with the convenience of a microwave.</p>

<p>We’ve met so many customers with incredible stories about how Cinder has changed their lives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>GET YOUR FREE-TIME BACK: </strong><br/>“When I come home from work I’m exhausted. I used to just buying prepared food, but I make a meal with Cinder now then actually spend time with my family while it’s cooking. We were playing Monopoly one day and I accidentally forgot to take some salmon out… for almost an hour or so. It still came out perfect.” — <strong>Anne-Marie, Dover</strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>MAKE EVERYONE IN YOUR FAMILY A CHEF:</strong><br/>“My husband got me a Cinder for my birthday and I was furious because I thought he bought it for himself as another space-wasting gadget! I didn’t use it for several weeks, but one day my 12 year old made some chicken and toasted bread in it for his teammates. I couldn’t believe how good it tasted. After that I was hooked. He made chef-quality food himself.” — <strong>Deb, Austin</strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>MAKE BLAND FOOD TASTE GREAT:</strong><br/>“I’m a professional body builder and spend quite a bit of time in the gym or doing personal training on the side. I used to put chicken breasts and steak into the oven in bulk, and they would come out dry and overdone. A friend loaned me his Cinder and it’s just brilliant. I throw the frozen breasts onto Cinder just like I did before, but now it tastes incredible and juicy. Never thought my barbaric cooking could taste so freaking good.” — <strong>Riz, New Jersey</strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>FOCUS ON THE REST OF YOUR MEAL:<br/> </strong>“My friends and I started a little underground restaurant of sort in San Francisco last year. We hold dinners at our house, but have a tiny kitchen and run out of pots and pans even when we’re cooking for our weekly guests. We use the Cinder to put all the protein on autopilot then focus on the creative side dishes and garnish stuff.” — <strong>James and Chelsea, San Francisco</strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>REMOVE THE HASSLE OF SOUS-VIDE:<br/> </strong>“My wife’s dad is a chef. A couple years back I bought a sous vide precision cooker to impress him with filet mignon. I didn’t realize you had to take the meat out and sear it after it was done cooking. The meat came out a grey color and so I stopped cooking for a while after that. Didn’t have the motivation to make a smoky mess of my kitchen. A few months ago I saw a Cinder at the Target Open House and knew this was exactly what I was looking for the first time I bought a sous-vide device. I’ve been cooking delicious scallops and zucchini and am excited to impress my father-in-law this weekend.” —<strong> Chris, Medford</strong>

</div></div>","Cinder is a countertop grill with the precision of sous-vide and the power of a stovetop. With grill plates that stay within 1 degree of your food's ideal temperature, Cinder provides edge-to-edge cooking with no temperature fluctuations — and it brings this precision to high-temperature searing too!
Order your Cinder through this campaign to get a discounted price and avoid waiting an extra 6-8 months before it hits stores. 
You are already accustomed to making consistently incredible meals with sous vide. 
But sous vide prep and clean-up take too much time (e.g. water baths, vacuum sealing, plastic bags, firing up the stove afterward). Cinder’s here to make sous vide faster, more versatile, and easier to use. 
The results have professional chefs and sous vide aficionados alike calling Cinder revolutionary. Chef Kenji made the world’s best grilled cheese on Cinder. And Serious Eats declared it ""excellent.""


 


 
Place any fresh or frozen food inside Cinder and it will cook to Michelin-starred perfection. 


 


 
Dial in a temperature or pair Cinder with the mobile app (Android version coming soon). The app automatically reads the thickness of your food (from Cinder) and tells you how long it'll take to cook. Cool, right?
No need for checking in or constant flipping. The temperature inside Cinder is so tightly controlled that you could leave it sitting inside Cinder for an additional 2 hours and your food still wouldn't overcook.
This is truly set-it-and-forget-it. If you don't regularly have the time to cook — or cook well — Cinder is the last kitchen appliance you'll ever need.
 

 


 
Cinder's ceramic plates don't require butter or oil, so you just put the food in and close the lid. That's it.
 

 


 
Whether it's a beep from the grill or a notification from the optional Cinder app, you'll be told when your food is done cooking — without you having to check.
Next, you can either let it sit at the target temperature and carry on with your other tasks. Or, you can switch Cinder into searing mode. In 45 seconds, you'll have a restaurant-quality sear with a deliciously caramelized exterior.
 


 



 

When you're done eating, wipe down the grill plates with a paper towel. There are no pans or pots to clean up, no grills to scrub, no utensils to clean — nothing. (When your food doesn't burn, there’s no sticky mess to clean up.)
So not only is Cinder set-it-and-forget-it, it's also zero hassle. Perfect for people short on time.
 

 
Cinder is the world’s first hyper-precision grill, and there's nothing like it on the market.
Precise temperature — not cooking time — is everything when it comes to cooking great food. Other appliances simply don’t have uniform temperatures across their surface. Steak dries out, salmon cooks unevenly, and you're left with food that’s mediocre unless you stressfully nail timing within 15-30s.
Cinder gets around this by using tiny heating nodes that continuously turn on and off to ensure every millimeter (literally) is at the correct temperature. This precision changes home cooking — no more monitoring and adjusting temperature every few minutes. Instead, work on your side dishes and talk with your family.
This is sous-vide cooking with the convenience of a microwave.

GET YOUR FREE-TIME BACK: “When I come home from work I’m exhausted. I used to just buying prepared food, but I make a meal with Cinder now then actually spend time with my family while it’s cooking.

MAKE BLAND FOOD TASTE GREAT:“I’m a professional body builder and spend quite a bit of time in the gym or doing personal training on the side. I used to put chicken breasts and steak into the oven in bulk, and they would come out dry and overdone. A friend loaned me his Cinder and it’s just brilliant. I throw the frozen breasts onto Cinder just like I did before, but now it tastes incredible and juicy. Never thought my barbaric cooking could taste so freaking good.” — Riz, New Jersey 

FOCUS ON THE REST OF YOUR MEAL: “My friends and I started a little underground restaurant of sort in San Francisco last year. We hold dinners at our house, but have a tiny kitchen and run out of pots and pans even when we’re cooking for our weekly guests. We use the Cinder to put all the protein on autopilot then focus on the creative side dishes and garnish stuff.” — James and Chelsea, San Francisco 

REMOVE THE HASSLE OF SOUS-VIDE: “My wife’s dad is a chef. A couple years back I bought a sous vide precision cooker to impress him with filet mignon. I didn’t realize you had to take the meat out and sear it after it was done cooking. The meat came out a grey color and so I stopped cooking for a while after that. Didn’t have the motivation to make a smoky mess of my kitchen. A few months ago I saw a Cinder at the Target Open House and knew this was exactly what I was looking for the first time I bought a sous-vide device. I’ve been cooking delicious scallops and zucchini and am excited to impress my father-in-law this weekend.” — Chris, Medford

<h3>Who we are....</h3>
<p>We create and self-distribute seasonal kegged cocktails and sangrias around Ohio where quality, quick-service and volume are valued. ​ We've created a local brand and niche in the alcohol industry that we believe can grow to a national brand!! Our drinks can be found in Cleveland, Columbus, Toledo, Dayton and their surrounding suburbs. </p>
<h3>
<strong>What do we value?</strong> </h3>
<p>Most importantly, we value exceptional taste. Additionally, pre-batched cocktails also have some significant advantages: they ensure consistency; perfect proportions; and fast serving. Kegged cocktails also reduce a bar's waste by eliminating heavy pours (industry average is 20% loss to over pours). During the busiest times, they also reduce strain on bartenders. Our kegged cocktails work on commercial beer draft systems, meaning there is no additional equipment required.</p>
<h3>​<strong>Where we're going?</strong> </h3>
<p>With the success of our cocktails and sangrias on draft (on-premise), we've embarked on canning our drinks and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. </p>
<h3>Our campaign....</h3>
<p>It’s been amazing to see an idea become reality, and now having proven our business model, we are looking to take the next step. We want to grow outside of our current sales area, so we need to increase our sales force, build brand awareness through improved marketing campaigns, expand our distribution and continue building through casino partnerships.</p>
<p>We know we could achieve this organically through operating cash flow, but it will take time, and we are impatient to see progress this coming year, so any contribution would be greatly appreciated - and also make you a part of our story and success!</p>

<h3>My background...</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Jim Waltz, and when I was growing up, like a lot of people I wanted to be an entrepreneur, although, I never really knew what business I wanted to get into.</p>
<p>After earning a BA in Business from Kent State University, in Ohio I began the corporate grind and quickly realized that it was not for me. So, back in 2009, with an understanding wife and a 1-yr old, we left Ohio and moved to North Carolina where I went back to school and earned an A.S. in Viticulture/Enology and we began life in the alcohol industry.</p>
<p>Once you understand fermentation, it leads you down a rabbit hole to learn how to make other alcohols. My curiosity eventually lead me to become both a Head Brewer and Head Distiller. In 2015 I was recruited by the owners of the Southern Tier Brewery in Lakewood, NY as the Head Distiller to help them launch the Southern Tier Distilling Company.</p>
<p>Although I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Southern Tier, the itch to start my own business kept coming back. It seemed obvious that the business would be in the alcohol production industry, but I didn’t just want to be another craft brewer or local distillery.</p>
<p>So in 2019 we launched Duck Island Cocktails!!! </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>With our proven business model and products, we will make an impact in the beverage industry. Our goal is to make some noise and standout in a very profitable industry.<br/> </p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any business venture, risks are always there. However, over the past year, our products have been well received and we’ve forged trust and credibility in our markets. This helps to minimize your risk, so now we can forge ahead with the challenge of growing with a smart/calculated approach together.</p>

Hi, my name is Jim Waltz, and when I was growing up, like a lot of people I wanted to be an entrepreneur, although, I never really knew what business I wanted to get into.
After earning a BA in Business from Kent State University, in Ohio I began the corporate grind and quickly realized that it was not for me. So, back in 2009, with an understanding wife and a 1-yr old, we left Ohio and moved to North Carolina where I went back to school and earned an A.S. in Viticulture/Enology and we began life in the alcohol industry.
Once you understand fermentation, it leads you down a rabbit hole to learn how to make other alcohols. My curiosity eventually lead me to become both a Head Brewer and Head Distiller. In 2015 I was recruited by the owners of the Southern Tier Brewery in Lakewood, NY as the Head Distiller to help them launch the Southern Tier Distilling Company.
Although I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Southern Tier, the itch to start my own business kept coming back. It seemed obvious that the business would be in the alcohol production industry, but I didn’t just want to be another craft brewer or local distillery.
So in 2019 we launched Duck Island Cocktails!!! 
The Impact
With our proven business model and products, we will make an impact in the beverage industry. Our goal is to make some noise and standout in a very profitable industry. 
Risks & Challenges
As with any business venture, risks are always there. However, over the past year, our products have been well received and we’ve forged trust and credibility in our markets. This helps to minimize your risk, so now we can forge ahead with the challenge of growing with a smart/calculated approach together.

<p>Do you remember trying a toaster pastry for the first time? A pastry with sweet frosting and an even sweeter filling that left you feeling like the happiest kid ever. Yet it was exactly that...full of sugar! As you grew older, you left those toaster pastries behind. They lacked positive nutrition and made you feel guilty after eating them. </p>
<p>We've stepped it up a notch and changed the meaning of breakfast. We have taken the guilt out of the guilty pleasure. We created a toaster pastry that your mom to this day would approve of! You want it and you can have it! Adulting has never tasted so good...</p>

<h3>Introducing our PRO Toasty! A higher protein, hand-crafted toaster pastry with all the goodness of the classics. </h3>
<p>What better way to fuel up your day than with a quality protein toaster pastry that takes you back to your childhood! Who says only kids have fun with their food? We create breakfast &amp; snacks that are both delicious AND healthy. Win-win! We source the best ingredients, and we wear our heart on our sleeve. </p>
<p>We're EARNEST, transparent, and you know you'll be getting the best out of every bite! We really love our food especially the PRO toasty! </p>
<p>What's not to love about the 3 flavors: Super Strawberry, Charged Chocolate, and Mighty Maple. Indulgent, decadent..it's a dessert and healthy food in one :). </p>

<h3>Our Secret Sauce...Almond Butter!</h3>
<p>You must be thinking we are crazy for adding almond butter because it's an expensive ingredient. We simply want the best for you all. We bake it into the PROToasty to make it a powerhouse breakfast that satisfies!  It adds plant-based protein and healthy fats to your diet. There's more protein than 1 egg! We use real ingredients and the almond butter is in the dough for a softer crust. A much better option than the dry, taste-less crust of other toaster pastries! </p>

<h3>Toasty Prep</h3>
<p>Hot out of the toaster or right out of the pouch! There's no wrong way to prep and eat the toasty. For an ooey, gooey filling, we recommend popping it in the toaster for a POP of flavor! If you're on-the-go, rip open the pouch and take a big bite! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have been formulating this toaster pastry for about 2 years now, and it's time to show the world what they're missing! Funny enough, toaster pastries are a bit like like rocket science and we have upgraded all aspects. Whole wheat flour, almond butter and collagen protein in the dough, hand-laid icing...every toasty is different and that's what makes it special! We've had some challenges finding a bakery that is up to our standards, and we finally found one. Let's fill everyone's bellies with our next level toaster pastry! </p>

<h3>Our Earnest Story</h3>
<p>Earnest Eats was founded by Andrew Aussie, CEO and traveling foodie, after he realized there was a gap between breakfast and snacks being yummy and healthy. He has come across many people including friends, family and our team who have worked together to turn this kitchen staple into a reality. Our team currently resides in sunny San Diego, and we love to eat...everything. We are professional goofballs who love to take advantage of the outdoors. Hiking, running, swimming...you name it.

<p><strong>Introducing WineBlock</strong></p>
<p>Everyone knows someone, if not yourself, who gets a wine-stained smile when they drink red wine. ""Wine mouth,"" as its commonly called. It's embarrassing and after researching solutions, we were frustrated to find there were no convenient or preventative solutions for that dreaded purple hue that appears on your smile after one or two glasses. There are over 1.38 Million Americans and 3.48 Billion people around the globe that drink wine, so we knew we weren't alone in this problem. </p>
<p>We spent two years developing WineBlock and enlisted the help  of a ""Green Chemist"" to ensure WineBlock was made with all-natural, safe, plant-based ingredients. After a small but very successful campaign in the Pacific Northwest, we're looking to take WineBlock to the next level and spread the word nationally and then GLOBALLY. Think #worlddom! But, we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $7.5K or more which we will use towards our marketing/ PR spend and the deposits for our next round of inventory.</li>
<li>We have put together four ""cheers worthy"" pledge packages that include WineBlock (of course) and other awesome wine accessories from our friends in the wine accessory biz. </li>
<li>These fun wine accessory packages make the perfect gifts for your favorite wine-loving friend or family member. </li>
<li>Our $69 pledge package gets you a whole lot of fun wine gear PLUS a chance to win an all-expense paid trip to Napa Valley and wine tasting tour for two! Each $69 pledge gives you an additional chance to win. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We love WineBlock because it's a simple solution to a common problem. We're in the business of making wine drinking even more enjoyable and we can't wait to take our company to the next level. We've had agreat response in our hometown of Seattle and the Pacific Northwest regiona including, 3 TV appearances on local Seattle affiliates for ABC, NBC and FOX networks. One customer that gave WineBlock a 5-star review said;</p>
<p><i>""So my teeth always stain when I drink red wine and it's pretty embarrassing. Have just been living with it all these years until now. Read about this product in one of my magazines and thought I would give it a try and I'm so happy I did. Just used it for an all-day wine tour and came out of that with white teeth. Hooray! The texture is nice and there isn't any flavor to interfere with your wine. The fact that it doubles as a lip balm is a bonus.""</i></p>
<p>What's next after WineBlock you ask? Coffee! We're starting development for our next product CoffeeBlock that will prevent the yellow hue you get on your teeth from your favorite cup of Joe. CoffeeBlock will be available in 2019.  </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Making an investment in inventory is tough for a small company. Manufactures make minimum orders high and ask for money up front. Spreading the word nationally and then globally requires a bigger spend than we currently have. We are looking to the wine-loving community to help us raise part of the funds to expand our reach. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We know some people can't contribute by purchasing a package, but that doesn't mean you can't help our mission to end red wine stained lips and teeth!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We want to make a difference in tea - and do it with a Nordic twist. Our craft teas are a representation of our Finnish heritage. They are plain and straight out natural, as we blend outstanding pure loose leaf teas with forest goodies from the North. Have you ever wondered why tea blends are filled with aromas and additives? We did, and wanted to change that. That is why our blends are crafted using only actual berries and herbs. There are no hidden ingredients or artificially enhanced flavors. When you brew a cup you can be sure it's all natural!</p>
<p><strong>Why we are bringing NORD-T to Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>A real tough challenger to the big corporate brands, NORD-T has been growing so quickly that it makes our hearts jump with excitement! The revolution is catching on and NORD-T is now found in more shops, tea houses and homes than ever before. We are taking our products to Indigogo so that we can reach more of you and enabling NORD-T to grow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure we get enough berries and herbs harvested during our short but oh-so-bright Finnish summer! For that we need more hands on deck and capital to purchase the ingredients from the lovely Finish farmers and producers.</li>
<li>Improve our package to be better, even prettier and easier to use. If we go over the target goal we will also make the first steps towards expanding our production and packing our beloved teas in neat little bags for better convenience on the go or at home.</li>
<li>Level up our production in tiny countryside town of Kihniö, Finland</li>
<li>Expand to more countries in Europe and beyond so you can find us in your favorite store near you soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe making a change in tea markets from industrial flavored tea blends to real craft teas. So be part of making a difference and get onboard!</p>
<h3>What makes NORD-T special?</h3>
<p>It's the fact all of our ingredients are grown by the most skillful farmer of them all- Mother Nature.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497267500/r8iqxxil1neycuutnxyv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What awesomeness have we prepared for you?</h3>
<p>We've bundled up neat packages to choose from as you back us up. Some of the coolest are limited editions, so make sure to get them before no one else does.</p>

<p>Our friendship goes all the way to being little kiddies living in same neighborhood and going to Sunday School together. But we grew up, travelling separately to far-flung countries and drinking many a brew. It was not until a common friend invited us to a breakfast in Helsinki - and Mirka got served a cup of tea not worth paying for - when we started to talk about changing the tea culture in restaurants and cafeterias. We wanted to ignite love for tea in the same places that had well-trained baristas pouring cappuccinos, espressos and creating wonderful foam arts to their customers.</p>
<p>One thing lead to another, and when we dug deeper to tea, we noticed most tea blends offered on the market were filled with industrial flavorings, artificial aromas and additives. We knew we had to do something, so we started making our own blends. NORD-T, Nordic tea, was born from our love to the forests and fields of northern lands. We started to make tea blends where absolu-tea-ly all ingredients come from the most skillful farmer of them all- Mother Nature.</p>

Our craft teas are a representation of our Finnish heritage. They are plain and straight out natural, as we blend outstanding pure loose leaf teas with forest goodies from the North. Have you ever wondered why tea blends are filled with aromas and additives? We did, and wanted to change that. That is why our blends are crafted using only actual berries and herbs. There are no hidden ingredients or artificially enhanced flavors. When you brew a cup you can be sure it's all natural!
Why we are bringing NORD-T to Indiegogo?
A real tough challenger to the big corporate brands, NORD-T has been growing so quickly that it makes our hearts jump with excitement! The revolution is catching on and NORD-T is now found in more shops, tea houses and homes than ever before. We are taking our products to Indigogo so that we can reach more of you and enabling NORD-T to grow.

Ensure we get enough berries and herbs harvested during our short but oh-so-bright Finnish summer! For that we need more hands on deck and capital to purchase the ingredients from the lovely Finish farmers and producers.
Improve our package to be better, even prettier and easier to use. If we go over the target goal we will also make the first steps towards expanding our production and packing our beloved teas in neat little bags for better convenience on the go or at home.
Level up our production in tiny countryside town of Kihniö, Finland
Expand to more countries in Europe and beyond so you can find us in your favorite store near you soon.

We believe making a change in tea markets from industrial flavored tea blends to real craft teas. So be part of making a difference and get onboard!
What makes NORD-T special?
It's the fact all of our ingredients are grown by the most skillful farmer of them all- Mother Nature.

What awesomeness have we prepared for you?
We've bundled up neat packages to choose from as you back us up. Some of the coolest are limited editions, so make sure to get them before no one else does.


Our friendship goes all the way to being little kiddies living in same neighborhood and going to Sunday School together. But we grew up, travelling separately to far-flung countries and drinking many a brew. It was not until a common friend invited us to a breakfast in Helsinki - and Mirka got served a cup of tea not worth paying for - when we started to talk about changing the tea culture in restaurants and cafeterias. We wanted to ignite love for tea in the same places that had well-trained baristas pouring cappuccinos, espressos and creating wonderful foam arts to their customers.
One thing lead to another, and when we dug deeper to tea, we noticed most tea blends offered on the market were filled with industrial flavorings, artificial aromas and additives. We knew we had to do something, so we started making our own blends. NORD-T, Nordic tea, was born from our love to the forests and fields of northern lands. We started to make tea blends where absolu-tea-ly all ingredients come from the most skillful farmer of them all- Mother Nature.
This is what's it all about - the teas
We have now 11 teas to be proud of and with help of you, tea lover, we're setting up the business to blend some more. So let's meet our current darlings!


All of our craft teas are done with real chunks of freeze-dried Finland grown berries.

<p>It works by quickly rotating an egg back and forth. This mixes the egg white and yolk inside the eggshell without introducing outside air. The flavor profile is fresh and delicious and it eliminates the need of hand whipping and messy clean up.</p>
<p>The Orbi is easy to use and absolutely hands-free. Place the egg in Orbi, lock it and in 20 seconds you have a perfectly scrambled egg.</p>

<p>'Golden Eggs' can be enjoyed hard or soft boiled, deviled or in egg salad, fried, pickled, atop noodles, or as a surprise on Easter Sunday. There are many preparations yet to be discovered, perhaps you will be the first to invent a new recipe? Golden eggs are known to be a delicacy but you'll have trouble finding a restaurant serving them and there are no appliances designed to create Golden Eggs... until now.</p>

</div></div>","Orbi is a hands-free kitchen gadget for making perfect golden eggs. It has been meticulously designed and tested to smoothly scramble the contents of an egg in the shell.

 

 

 

 

 
If you've enjoyed some of the many culinary innovations lately, you may be aware of a rare treat known as ‘the golden egg’. Most people have never tasted the exquisite flavor of an In-shell Scrambled Egg.

 
 

 
Become a backer of this project and pick a reward. You will essentially be pre-ordering orbi. You'll get a special backer discount, and you'll receive your stuff before it is available in stores. 
   
 

 
It works by quickly rotating an egg back and forth. This mixes the egg white and yolk inside the eggshell without introducing outside air. The flavor profile is fresh and delicious and it eliminates the need of hand whipping and messy clean up.
The Orbi is easy to use and absolutely hands-free. Place the egg in Orbi, lock it and in 20 seconds you have a perfectly scrambled egg.

 

 

 
'Golden Eggs' can be enjoyed hard or soft boiled, deviled or in egg salad, fried, pickled, atop noodles, or as a surprise on Easter Sunday. There are many preparations yet to be discovered, perhaps you will be the first to invent a new recipe? Golden eggs are known to be a delicacy but you'll have trouble finding a restaurant serving them and there are no appliances designed to create Golden Eggs... until now.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The gif shown some examples. You can make your style.

KITCHEN: A Project of Love</b></p>
<p>Two Mammas' Vegan Kitchen is a work of love and a
collaborative project that brings healthy, ethical and locally sourced, organic
ingredients to our customers. The cooking showcases the beauty, nutrition and
creativity that seasonal produce offers. Often, the ingredients used are either
grown by the business owners themselves or are picked from other Bay Area
farms. From Two Mammas’ Vegan Kitchen, love is imparted through the ethics of
simplicity and non-violence, through the fun we have together while growing and
harvesting food that feeds our community, and through the artistry infused into
each bite. We strive to combine the delightful, decadent tastes our customers
love from wholesome, nutritious ingredients.</p>
<p>Two Mammas’ Vegan Kitchen is a collaboration of Jules and
Jess Piovarcsik- Diliberto, a happily married, queer, vegan couple. We met in meditation
and fell in love a year later baking vegan apple pies for our meditation
center’s fundraiser. We’ve been successfully creating healthy, creative and
delicious food together for three years. </p>
<p>As a business, Two Mammas’ was birthed during the economic
downturn of 2011. We were both unemployed, deeply in love, and constantly in
search of affordable organic produce. We volunteered at urban farms in exchange
for healthy ingredients, saved seeds to grow our own food, and scouted out
nearby food banks, only to be disappointed and outraged by the lack of fresh
food offered to poor people in our East Oakland neighborhood. When the Cottage
Foods bill passed in January 2012, allowing us to apply for a health permit for
our home kitchen, we launched Two Mammas’. Two Mammas’ has been offering
Cottage Foods baked goods and personal chef services for over a year, and more
recently we have started offering catering services. Now we are ready to move
to a café space in East Oakland that is kid-friendly, near public
transportation, and that provides healthy, delicious, affordable food options
this side of Lake Merritt. This campaign is a community initiative to raise
funds for the build-out of our new vegan café space in East Oakland.</p>

<p><b>WHY EAT SEASONAL, LOCAL, NON-GMO and VEGAN?</b></p>
<p> Two Mammas’ Vegan
Kitchen uses mostly organic, non-GMO, seasonal ingredients that are typically
grown within 200 miles of our location in East Oakland. Jules and Jess handpick
most seasonal ingredients from small Bay Area farms. Artichokes come from
Pescadero. Walnuts come from Modesto. Berries and tomatoes are grown in Oakland
and Brentwood. As a couple, we handpick ingredients together at the peak of
ripeness. We love gardening, harvesting, and feeding people plant-based foods
that are healthy for people and the planet. Cooking delicious, creative,
healthy food is how we as a couple express our love for each other and our
world.</p>
<p>There are several benefits associated with local, seasonal
food. Customers are directly supporting local agriculture and micro-economies.
Local produce is also more environmentally friendly and sustainable, thereby
minimizing our customers’ carbon footprints. Further, it should be noted that
harvesting, eating and preserving peak-season, organic produce locks in vital
nutrients that are commonly lost in commercial agriculture. Finally, eating the
freshest food possible locks in the tastes, textures and subtle flavors
intrinsic within delicious cuisine.</p>
<p>Everything at Two Mammas’ is made from vegan love. Vegan
food is cruelty-free and doesn’t involve the use of other species for meat,
milk or eggs. In terms of the steadily increasing trend of vegetarianism in the
American population, cruelty-free dining is an important, distinct benefit of our
cuisine. Vegan food is also very healthy. Plant-based diets don’t require as
much energy to digest and assimilate nutrients in comparison to meat-based
diets. (Braizer 2007) There are less allergens and no antibiotics in eating
plants. (Bernard 2003) For the semi-vegetarian, vegetarian and vegan segments
of U.S.
society, vegan food represents lower incidents of heart disease, lower
cholesterol levels, less diabetes and increased longevity. (Bernard 2003) Vegan
food is also more environmentally-friendly than meat-based foods. It is lower
in waste and does not contribute to global warming. Rainforests throughout South America are being cut down at alarming rates to
make room for cattle grazing and ranching. (Mgbeoji 2006, Rifkin 1993) A
commonly cited statistic is that farmers can feed ten vegetarians on the same land
it takes to feed one meat eater (Vegetarian Research Group, Rifkin 1993).
Further, global warming-induced draughts, privatization of water, and waste
from industrial animal agriculture in the form of runoff, irrigation and
drinking, is causing a global-thirst, and war, for the 3% of available drinking
water in the world. (Shiva 2002) For Two Mammas’ and the communities we serve,
the environmental impacts of a plant-based diet carry a sense of urgency and
responsibility. </p>
<p><b>THE NEW CAFÉ BUILD OUT</b></p>
<p>We have a few
addresses in mind for our Oakland-grown café. But we realize that there is a
lot more to opening a café than having keys and an address. The spaces we have
been looking at are awesome in terms of their community-dining potential, but
none of them have been food making or food gathering spaces in the past. This
means we need architectural plans to show the health department, plumbing,
electrical outlets, counters, tables, and a big refrigerator for all our winter
greens and summer berries. This is why the indiegogo campaign is so important!</p>
<p>While financial
support is super important to making the café build out happen, there are other
ways to help the build out happen. Passing along this fundraising campaign link
is super helpful because it helps our networks and communities grow. If you
have any used commercial equipment, we might be able to use it. Also, if you
have any carpentry, plumbing, electrical or general construction skills to
offer, let us know. We can feed you in exchange for these services. </p><p></p></div>","TWO MAMMAS’ VEGAN

<p>My name is Stew Corey and I have owned Mexicali since May of 2016. Before that I was a manager at The Windjammer for 6 years. My experience in restaurants goes back to when I was a dishwasher at the Birdseye Diner in Castleton, Vermont when I was 16, almost 20 years ago. It was while I was working at The Windjammer that I meet the Charboneaus and fell in love with Mexicali. From the first time I walked through the doors I knew it was a special place. I could tell by the smiles on the faces of the guests and the staff that it was great place and I instantly wanted to take part. My family and I made the decision to purchase Mexicali and on May 4th, 2016 I took ownership, the day before Cinco de Mayo! Since then I have only fell more in love with Mexicali and the people of the community. I have made mistakes and learned a lot over the course of the last year and unfortunately my last mistake lead to a very severe lesson, one that I will never forget. I am humbly asking our community and friends to help me keep this tradition alive not for my family, but for the charity work that is still to be done, the good food still to serve, the shorties still to be drunk and the hot ranch still to dip. Please help me to prove that sometimes the little guy does win!</p>
<p>Your donations will be used for two phases of the plan to move forward: Phase 1 is to wrap up Mexicali 2.0 and Phase 2 is seed capital for Mexicali 3.0. </p>
<p>Phase 1 will be to close out all the accounts payable that are left including, but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>    -paying off outstanding balances to vendors</p>
<p>    -paying the balance of the utility bills</p>
<p>    -paying the outstanding taxes</p>
<p>    -paying off creditors</p>
<p>    -paying the legal fees incurred during the eviction process</p>
<p>I won’t know the the exact amount that Phase 1 will cost until I receive a bill for the legal fees and any other fees my previous landlord is going to charge me, but my best estimate is $75,000-$100,000. Hopefully it will be less, but time will tell.</p>
<p>Phase 2 is the exciting part! During Phase 2 your donations will fund the following:</p>
<p>    -putting a down payment on a new space</p>
<p>    -buying refurbished equipment to kit out the new kitchen</p>
<p>    -new signage, computer system, office supplies and other small items</p>
<p>    -stocking the kitchen and the bar with all of your favorites</p>
<p>    -getting new licenses and insurance</p>
<p>    -renovations as needed to the new space</p>
<p>    -any other costs of restarting Mexicali</p>
<p>Phase 2 is going to be funded by your donations and an investment of my own and my family’s funds. You might be asking why I have to buy equipment and a computer system; that is because they were sold to cover a part of the money owed to a creditor. So the balance of the donations will go towards this phase of the plan, between $150,000-$175,000, depending. We will be working together to get Mexicali 3.0 off the ground!</p>
<p>The perks that I am offering to our generous supports are, but not limited to, Gift Cards, a chance to sign the wall in the bar, a never released Mexicali hat, a plaque with your name and/or picture, 15% discount for life and the secret recipes to our most coveted menu and drink items! </p>
<p>Mexicali has been a part of the Williston community for over 20 years and has been an active member of that community. Generations of families have come through the doors, people have meet, dated and become engaged at Mexicali. Mexicali is woven into the fabric of the community and I would like it to be so for years to come with your help.</p>
<p>Restaurants are a risky business, but I believe with the support of our loving network of friends, regulars, family and 1000s of satisfied guests from all over the state and country that we will be successful! Even if you can’t contribute, please share this campaign with all your friends and family either by word of mouth, on social media or using the Indiegogo share tools so that my plea can reach as many people as possible. Please help me to continue this local tradition. </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h3>Let's Talk About Why Some Drinks Taste of Metal</h3>
<p><strong>The bottle's material you choose will have an impact on your drinks flavor.</strong> It can also be a potential breeding ground for bacteria, staining, rust and contain foul smells.</p>
<p><strong>Generally, there are four main bottle options to choose from: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong> Plastic</strong> - Over time, plastic stains whilst absorbing odors and flavors </li>
<li>
<strong> Stainless Steel</strong>  - Sometimes imparts off flavors and doesn’t work with citric liquids</li>
<li>
<strong> Glass</strong> - Sometimes contains lead and usually cannot withstand high temperatures</li>
<li>
<strong> Ceramic</strong> - It is neutral and neither absorbs nor imparts flavors and it's great to retain heat<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598333359/jodwitjd4xs2d4ixeigq.jpg"" src=""""/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ceramics are fired to temperatures in the thousands of degrees. By doing so, this helps to ensure the porcelain will not absorb any moisture, flavor, odor or stains.</p>

<h2>Our Ceramic Bottles are Eco-friendly</h2>
<p>As of 2017, <i>a million plastic bottles were bought across the globe each minute</i>, with many of these destined for landfill or the ocean rather than the recycling centre.</p>

<h2>Anatomy of a Better Bottle &amp; Thermos</h2>
<p><strong>WOKY can easily fit in a tote, messenger, or a backpack</strong> and can fit in most cupholders.</p>
<p>In terms of function, long-lasting freshness is guaranteed and the contents are held securely in place. Hot liquids stay warm for 6 hours. Cold liquids stay chilled for 6 hours.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598450663/sbaqx5cyalxxlslgxx5r.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Stronger - Scratch and everyday wear resistant</h3>
<p>WOKY is different from the normal baking bottle body used by most thermos bottles on the market.  We use powder coating technology which has passed 13 rigorous process tests.  </p>
<p>On the subject of testing, our 50kg gravity drop tests show there was no major damage. Knocks, normal height drops and bumps will not break the bottle.</p>
<p>We have added a food grade silicone ring on the edge and on the lid, to enhance protection. </p>
<p><strong>We provide a limited warranty against manufacturer defects and will replace any eligible product found to be defective within the scope of normal/appropriate use.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598450811/iz0k12tiqrchtckpcuyw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Secure and prevents leakage - Keeping the contents safe</h3>
<p>The lid is inbuilt into the top of the screw-top cap and opens and closes quickly to prevent leakage.  The silicon case holder protects the bottle from breaking and is soft. </p>
<p>By using the handle to close the lid, it helps tighten the lid further thus prevent leaking. WOKY is 100% leak-proof, sealing the bottle cap with a silicone rubber ring.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598450872/od0pzzfi0scpzyw9xtpt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Clean -  Now more than ever, keeping your bottle squeaky clean is so important</h3>
<p>The inner ring of the WOKY ceramic thermos cup uses the same food grade silicone glue as baby pacifiers.  This makes the bottle heat resistant to 120 degrees and can be directly thrown into hot water for disinfection.</p>
<p>It's dishwasher safe too.  All areas of the WOKY bottle can easily be reached with the WOKY bottle cleaning brush, included with every reward.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand-wash after each use. Scrub with a soft sponge to keep the surface smooth.</li>
<li>Rinse the bottle immediately with hot water. For heavy stains, soak for 6+ hours.</li>
<li>The ring inside the bottle can be washed, dried and inserted back into the cup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Solving Problems for our Target Audience</h2>
<p>Compared with most bottles and thermos' on the market, WOKY can handle water with lemon, tea, hot coffee, protein shakes, energy drinks, hot chocolate, soda to soup.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Tea drinkers</h3>
<p>Tea can contain a large amount of tannic acid, theophylline, aromatic oil and multivitamins. For example, a thermos cannot regulate temperatures, so tea can taste bitter, vitamins are destroyed and overall reduces the nutritional value.</p>
<p>Brew your hot or iced tea at home or on the go, and WOKY will keep its ideal temperature.</p>

Let's Talk About Why Some Drinks Taste of Metal
The bottle's material you choose will have an impact on your drinks flavor. It can also be a potential breeding ground for bacteria, staining, rust and contain foul smells.
Generally, there are four main bottle options to choose from: 


 Plastic - Over time, plastic stains whilst absorbing odors and flavors 

 Stainless Steel  - Sometimes imparts off flavors and doesn’t work with citric liquids

 Glass - Sometimes contains lead and usually cannot withstand high temperatures

 Ceramic - It is neutral and neither absorbs nor imparts flavors and it's great to retain heat


Ceramics are fired to temperatures in the thousands of degrees. By doing so, this helps to ensure the porcelain will not absorb any moisture, flavor, odor or stains.

We don't want to strain or filter. We just want to pour and enjoy.</p><p>The idea for Spirale originated with a bottle of delicious red wine.

We started Vacanti Wine Glasses to enhance your appreciation of the beautiful subtleties of wine. With our premium, hand-crafted Spirale design, you are able to enjoy your wine like never before. Its patented spiral at the bottom of the glass captures the sediment in wine, which reveals its richness while ensuring a smoother finish. Savor and enjoy every last sip. Select your favorite wine, uncork and pour into your Spirale glass.  Enjoy your wine as sediment settles into the hand-blown Spirale design. That’s it! Appreciate the unique properties of your wine, enjoy the smooth texture, and savor every sip without the worry of bitter sediment.  During testing, we sent over 600 glasses to people for testing and feedback. Here are just a few that love Spirale glasses!     Wine glasses today are built to hold wine, but they’re not built to enhance your experience of the wine. That’s why we designed our patented corkscrew system. As sediment settles to the bottom of the bowl, the spiral in the stem separates the sediment from the wine. This hand-blown feature keeps the sediment at bay, even down to the last drop. The last thing you want is to have your glass of wine ruined by sediment. With Spirale, enjoy your favorite wine without the concern of sediment. Trap the sediment and eliminate the possibility of a horrible, bitter taste. Part of the experience of enjoying wine is the presentation. Our elegant, hand-blown design is the perfect fusion of form and function. Enjoy a glass of wine on the porch after a long day, or set your table with Spirale glasses for an elegant dinner party - they’re sure to look beautiful anywhere! Don’t think your wine has sediment? Some bottles of wine may surprise you. With Spirale wine glasses, there is no need to plan ahead to separate sediment from your wine through decanting or filtering. Be spontaneous! Simply open, pour and enjoy. Our glasses have you covered.  An added bonus? Spirale may be unique, but the clean up isn’t. Not only can these glasses be easily hand washed, but Spirale glasses are dishwasher safe too!          We sent over 600 sample glasses to retailers, wine experts, wineries, restaurants, and target consumers all around the world to gather their input to perfect our design. We’ve had hundreds of experts use and clean Spirale to great success. Here’s what they say...

       We're Margarita and Patrick Vacanti, wine lovers on a mission to enhance the experience of wine. We don't want to strain or filter. We just want to pour and enjoy.The idea for Spirale originated with a bottle of delicious red wine. We enjoyed every sip until the last one was tainted by a bitter flow of sediment. Inspired by how the shape of a corkscrew grips a cork, we embedded a spiral at the bottom of our glass to ""grip"" the sediment. After five years of industry testing and consumer feedback, Spirale is ready for the world to enjoy.

And we add some flair with Pining for My Honey…a layer of caramel with roasted pinenuts, honey and some lavender. Or Snap My Ginger, a brown sugar caramel infused with organic ginger and enrobed in dark chocolate. Those are only a few of our flavors. When it comes to caramel - we go all out! No corn syrup.

<p>Always having little to no time for myself during the workday, I tend to grab a snack bar to tie me over when hunger strikes, yet I always find myself unsatisfied with everything that is out on the market;  either filled with sugars or chalky texture.  That being said, I set out to create a wholefood bar that is not only truly delicious but with gut-loving collagen to nourish my body from the inside out.  For those of you that are always busy hustling and kicking ass, TimeFor bars are for you; a healthy bridge snack to keep your energy flowing and a moment to savour!</p>
<p>With your help, I can start producing my super yummy wholefood collagen bars and to help remind you to make #TimeFor yourself! </p>
</div><div>
<p>My goal is to raise $10,000 so that I can bring TimeFor to life!</p>
<p>The funds would be used as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial bulk ordering of raw ingredients</li>
<li>inimum production runs for packaging</li>
<li>Commercial equipment items needed to start production</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your time and support :)</p>

<p><strong>Mason jar fermentation couldn't be easier</strong>, thanks to FermLock - the first true one-piece, screw-on, waterless, double-valved airlock for all wide mouth Mason jars.</p>
<p><strong>Spin the FermLock into place and it will take care of the rest</strong> as your batch of superfood ferments in the fridge for the following weeks and months. No burping or maintenance of any sort is required. Enjoy delicious, gourmet fermented foods with just the spin of a lid.</p>

<h2>Healthy.</h2>
<p><strong>Fermented foods are super beneficial for both the body and mind</strong>. Lacto-fermentation is the process of fermenting vegetables in brine (salt-water) in order to preserve their nutrients, produce beneficial enzymes and probiotics, and improve their taste.</p>
<p><strong>Fermentation requires an anaerobic environment</strong>, meaning oxygen must not be present. If vegetables are exposed to oxygen, they can become contaminated. Under proper fermenting conditions, carbon dioxide is released as a byproduct of the process. As it builds up inside the jar, it must be released, or the jar can burst.</p>
<p><strong>FermLock puts the lacto-fermentation process on autpilot</strong> and let's you explore and enjoy healthy and delicious fermented food with zero effort, in the comfort of your very own kitchen.</p>

<p><strong>FermLock is the only true one-piece</strong>, waterless Mason jar fermentation airlock that requires zero maintenance.

<p><strong>While fermenting, carbon dioxide builds up</strong>, and it must be released or the pressure can become so intense inside of the jar that it will cause the jar to explode. One-way valves make it possible to release the accumulating carbon dioxide without allowing oxygen to enter.</p>
<p><strong>We placed two one-way valves in the center</strong> of the FermLock to ensure that, as carbon dioxide builds, it is able to continuously escape in the proper amount at the proper time - fermenting your batch to perfection.</p>

<p><strong>The easy release of carbon dioxide, at the right time</strong>, without allowing oxygen to enter, is essential to the lacto-fermentation process working correctly and keeping harmful mold from growing.</p>
<p><strong>We engineered six channels</strong> that efficiently funnel the carbon dioxide into and through the two escape valves as pressure builds. This creates an equalized, more consistent lacto-fermentation process, resulting in more nutritious, higher quality fermented foods. </p>

SHIPPING TO YOUR DOOR! Now that we know that we are only making 500 we have revamped the Scotch Whisky Advent Calendar 6th Edition perk to reflect how many are still available. We can now keep track and when we get to 500 it will be all over.If you want to join the new Secret Spirits adventure in 2019, this is the ONLY WAY to get one of our 6th Edition Scotch Whisky Calendars. There will only ever be 500 made. BE GIFT GIVER OF THE YEAREVEN IF YOU GIVE IT TO YOURSELFWe founded Secret Spirits five years ago, and created the first Scotch Whisky Advent Calendar: A treasure trove of 25 rare, independently-bottled, share-sized drams of single-cask and limited edition Scotch whiskies we hand-select in Scotland every year for our annual run of 2,000 calendars.Even though we’ve always called our box of scotch an “advent calendar”, presenting 25 days of scotch from December 1st through Christmas Day, it is even more accurate to say simply each box has 25 doors.

 

 

Our unique “packaging gamification” of rarer whiskies in larger bottles offers far more than just whiskies you’ve never tasted before and won’t taste again: they take you on an imaginative adventure.
 The journey begins whenever you’re ready, and can last as long as you like.It's the ultimateBirthdayChristmasAnniversaryor Retirement giftANYONE WHO LOVES WHISKYIn everything we do as Independent Bottlers (and Spirits Appreciators) we seek to bring out in a BIG way what most people skip over or miss completely when they have a dram:MYSTERY, DISCOVERY AND DELIGHTWe pack five years-worth of whisky tasting experience into every box, and every 50ml bottle has enough whisky in it for a few people to share the experience (or to just keep all for yourself).Every set we create includes limited edition glasses, collector lapel pins, and other thematic curiosities. Secret Spirits truly lets you ...CHOOSE YOUR ADVENTURETo say that our journey producing the Scotch Whisky Calendar has been a challenge would be understating it. Every step of the way we have had to push through
Regulatory challenges
Traditional retail industry apathy
Hundreds of moving parts/logistics that make production always a hyper-stressful, last-minute affair
By the time everyone in the process gets their piece of the pie, we use the last Oliver-Twist-sized slice of cash to start the journey all over again.Over the last 5 years, we have slowly built a community and continue to forge this brand new category in our industry. Through sheer passion for what we do and because of the happiness it brings people all over the world, Cindy and I have put everything on the line to continue to dream big and create magic.We humbly ask for your help so we can continue making THE ORIGINAL Scotch Whisky Advent Calendar for the whisky-loving world.EVERY PENNY WILL HELPWe’re giving away some awesome stuff too, so check out all the different levels!

Go green with the MateCaps boosting experience! Healthier. Greener. Better.  The delicious and natural flavor of one Cap was designed to last for the whole capacity of the bottle (14 oz. / 410 ml)    Yerba mate comes from the leaves of a native species of the holly tree, Ilex Paraguariensis, found deep in the South American rainforest. This powerful plant has been enjoyed for many centuries and for good reason. – Its richness in antioxidants, and nutrients can boost energy and improve mental focus without any of the unpleasant side effects like jitters or crashing.Nowadays, mate is part of the daily routine of almost everyone in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and South Brazil, as well as of lots of #matelovers around the world.   The consumption of mate improves cardiovascular functions while boosting the body’s defenses and lowering cholesterol and blood pressure levels. The main properties of yerba mate are: fat-free, low calorie and low sodium. It contains micronutrients such as magnesium, vitamins B1 and B6. Research has shown mate to provide anti-cancer and anti-diabetic therapeutic properties.  When you use MateCaps, what you drink is clean enough to go back into the Earth ♻️? Nourish your body well while nourishing your Earth well, too ?    Decreed the symbol of friendship by Yari, the mythical goddess of mate, the culture of yerba mate is just as rich as its flavor.The origins of yerba mate begin with the Guarani, an ancient tribe from the South American rainforests. The Guarani worshiped the yerba mate tree as a gift from the gods and prized it for its strengthening properties.European explorers soon learned of all the uses and virtues of yerba mate from the Guarani people. Its consumption quickly spread across the region as it gained a reputation as the “drink of the gods”.  Further on, the Jesuits introduced yerba mate to the rest of the world, and today the tradition of drinking yerba mate has been passed down for generations: yerba mate awakens the mind, brings people together and creates a community that stretches around the world.   MateCaps was designed to drink mate individually for when you’re on the-go, but what if we keep the values of sharing a pleasant moment with our loved ones?We asked our international Instagram community “What does mate mean to you?” and these were some of their answers:  To keep the tradition alive we created the “Friendship Pack” so you can keep a bottle for yourself, and gift the other to those you love! Enjoy your mate while boosting your buddy, too. Share the wonderful benefits of mate with your dearest friends and family, and bring them the South American experience through their own bottle. They'll think of you, even when they’re on the go!    We know you live a busy life, and you rely on your daily energy boost. The problem is that the typical solutions all come with costs, either to your wallet or to the Earth. For example, a typical 6-pack of canned yerba mate drinks costs around $35.99. However, our monthly CapsBox subscription provides 24 Caps, equivalent to 24 drinks, for only $14.99. That’s more than four times the yerba mate for half the price, and 24 fewer cans dumped into landfills per month!You don’t have to worry about running out of organic mate: Once you get your MateCaps Pack our monthly subscription will be ready to apply at matecaps.com. With your pledge you will get a lifetime 25% discount in our Caps subscription.   Earth Aid SolutionsBeyond the sustainable design of the MateCaps experience, this project is committed to making positive, lasting impacts on the environment. We partnered up with Earth Aid Solutions, a start-up NGO working to fight deforestation in the Amazon. Earth Aid planted 1,000 native trees in North-Eastern Brazil in 2019, and are planning to plant 10,000 in 2020, and 100,000 in 2021. And guess what? For every Kickstarter reward, they will plant one more native tree in the Amazon!   Fortalecer MisionesAs entrepreneurs, we feel privileged to be running this project, and believe that everyone should have the opportunity to make their ideas into a reality. Fortalecer Misiones is an Argentine social NGO focused on financing local women entrepreneurs from Misiones, one of the main yerba mate cultivation areas. The MateCaps team has committed to providing entrepreneurial consultancy to the Fortalecer Misiones’ staff. For every Kickstarter reward, we donate 50 cents to this cause.    For wholesale offers, please email us at info@matecaps.com      We started MateCaps because we saw a need for a natural and sustainable way to help people stay energized. Our team understands the importance of staying awake and focused for long workdays and late nights. Unfortunately, coffee and energy drinks were bad for us, leaving us jittery and anxious, and bad for the environment, creating waste with one-use containers.Every founder of the MateCaps team is from the land of yerba mate in South America, so we understand the beauty of the plant, the feel-good energy and the valued traditions of the drink. As we’ve traveled far from our homes, we’ve been inspired to share the natural benefits of yerba mate with those around us.       Chat with us! Shipping DetailsWe are happy to share MateCaps with the world, with shipping available to more than 150 countries worldwide.

You don't need to carry anything around with you larger than a pack of gum. HangOn is small and slim enough to fit in your pocket or purse.Each pack of HangOn contains 10 chewable tablets (5 servings) and will retail for $20.That works out to less than the cost of a beer ($4) to detox the night!                    (1) Take two tablets at least 30 minutes before your first alcoholic drink. HangOn is most effective when taken prior to drinking.(2) Enjoy your drinks! Let loose!(3) Take an additional 2 tablets for every 3 or 4 alcoholic drinks consumed. We encourage you to drink responsibly.HangOn is currently available in a tart citrus flavor!Our Story: The BeginningHangOn started as the idea of a team of young professionals living in New York City. From our time in the corporate world, we are well aware of the need to wake up each morning and perform at a high level throughout the day (even if the night before involved a few too many drinks). Happy hours, holiday parties and corporate events sprinkled between birthdays and spontaneous meet-ups with friends for drinks led to some rough mornings in the office. Our Story: The ProblemIt was hard to enjoy nights out without having to suffer a drop in productivity (accompanied by fatigue, headaches, stomach issues and a general aversion to any activity). Each of us had tried conventional hangover remedies including: chugging liters of Gatorade or Pedialyte, taking a few ibuprofen pills, coffee, cold showers, bowls of ramen or pho, greasy diner food, or even trying to go to the gym to ""sweat it out"", with limited success. Our Story: The SolutionEnough was enough. We committed to finding a better solution and decided to take a leap of faith and start HangOn. We consulted 30+ of the world's experts: medical doctors, chemists, pharmacologists and nutraceutical specialists who specialized in supplements, hangovers and alcohol. We read everything we could find on alcohol metabolism, hangovers, liver detoxification and existing remedies. All of this science pointed to the liver's ability to metabolize and remove the toxic by-product of alcohol, acetaldehyde, from the body, and the glutamine rebound. Based on our team's research and discussions with the experts, we had finally created the first HangOn formula. Now it was time to test the theory in reality.For several months straight, we drank in the name of science (nursed a few hangovers ourselves) and tested the efficacy of our formula, consulting the world's experts as we went and making the proper adjustments.  Nearly a year later, using our discussions with experts, our in-house medical expertise (a doctor with a MBA from Duke University) and real-world testing, our team created the FDA-compliant HangOn tablet. It was time to move forward to get it into more people's hands.Help Us Help You!The HangOn Team has perfected a proprietary formula, contracted a certified manufacturer based in the United States and completed a small-batch production run. Now, we need your help to take the next steps to get HangOn into your hands!The funds from this Indiegogo campaign will go to:
Scale up operations.
Begin sales online and in retail stores.
Enable the development and research of new product lines, flavors and packaging.
Our MissionOur goals with the launch of HangOn are three-fold.
We hope to become the go-to supplement for drinkers.
We hope to educate drinkers on the effects of alcohol and the science of hangovers.
We hope to provide our customers with new and innovative products. We're constantly brainstorming ideas for the next big idea!

<h3>Történetünk</h3>
<p>A tudatos étkezés egyre nagyobb hangsúlyt kap napjainkban. Annak ellenére, hogy egyre többen odafigyelnek erre, a nagyvárosokban nem egyszerű beszerezni az ellenőrzött forrásból származó, vegyszermentes alapanyagokat.</p>
<p>A növényközpontú, kevesebb hús fogyasztását támogató, főként zöldségen és gyümölcsön alapuló táplálkozás földünk megóvásában is kulcsszerepet játszik.</p>
<p>Ezekre az igényekre a mi ötletünk is megoldást nyújt: bérelj tőlünk egy földterületet, amin mi egészséges és zamatos zöldségeket és gyümölcsöket termesztünk és házhoz szállítjuk neked. Különböző méretű földterületek bérlete közül választhatsz, ezekhez különböző méretű és más rendszerességgel kiszállított kosarak tartoznak. Közösségi kertet tervezünk létrehozni, amelynek lényege, hogy a termést a bérlők között osztjuk szét a bérelt terület aránya szerint, majd eljuttatjuk nekik. A projekt mögött egy lelkes fiatalokból álló csapat és egy mezőgazdasággal és kertészettel több, mint 30 éve foglalkozó család áll. Ez garancia arra, hogy a termelés teljes folyamatát, a vetéstől a betakarításig hozzáértő kezek felügyelik.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549269348/ypnjtuvk1tt2f3twhym2.png"" src=""""/></p> <h3>Mire van szükségünk és mit adunk cserébe</h3>
<p>Ahhoz, hogy elindulhasson a projekt, 18 000 Euró befektetésre van szükségünk. Ebből megvalósítható, hogy egy 500 m2-es földterület felszereljünk mindennel, ami a termeléshez szükséges (kerítéssel, öntöző- és biztonsági rendszerrel, 360°-os kamerákkal) és megkezdjük a termesztést.</p>
<p>Az ötletünket legkönnyebben a Farmville játékhoz tudjuk hasonlítani a való életben. Ha bérelsz tőlünk egy területet, mindent nyomon tudsz majd követni kamerákon keresztül és létrehozunk egy zárt Facebook csoportot is. A célunk, hogy közösséget is építsünk, ahol megoszthatjuk a híreket és újdonságokat, ami a földeken történik, sőt a bérlőket részben bevonjuk a termelést érintő kérdésekbe, még szavazásokat is tervezünk, például arról, hogy milyen növénykultúrákat ültessünk.</p>
<p>Az első évben a termények házhozszállítása csak Budapesten lesz elérhető, de aki távolabbról szeretné támogatni a kezdeményezésünket, annak is van lehetősége. A jótékonysági kosár kiválasztásával egy gyermekotthon kapja a teljes csomagot.</p>
<p>Imádjuk a közösségi kert koncepcióját! Ennek ellenére, ha idén nem sikerül a megfelelő összegű támogatást megkapnunk, nem adjuk fel. A befolyt összeget természetesen visszaadjuk a támogatóinknak és tovább dolgozunk az ötletünkön és jövőre újrakezdjük.</p> <h3>A projekt hatása</h3>
<p>Hiszünk abban, hogy egy olyan közösség fog létrejönni, ami csupa egészség iránt elkötelezett emberből áll, akiket az is érdekel, hogy hogyan kerül a megkapott zöldség és gyümölcs az asztalra.</p>
<p>Úgy gondoljuk, hogy hozzájárulunk a megrendelőink életminőségének javuláshoz azzal, ha tápanyagban gazdag és finom zöldségeket és gyümölcsöket termelünk. Hosszú távon szeretnénk felhívni a figyelmet arra, hogy mennyivel jobb hazai, ellenőrzött helyről érkező ételt fogyasztani. Egyre világosabban látszik, hogy akkor tesszük a legjobbat magunknak és a bolygónak is, amin élünk, ha minél kevesebb feldolgozott élelmiszert és húst fogyasztunk, és növényi táplálékkal helyettesítjük egy részét. A tömeges termelés és a vegyszerek káros hatásától mentesen, a lehető legtermészetesebb módon gondoskodhatunk így magunkról és családunkról is.</p>
<p>A támogatóink segítségével szeretnénk olyanoknak is segíteni, akiknek igazán szükségük van rá. Minden kiszállított csomag után egy adag zöldséget és gyümölcsöt eljuttatunk a Zirzen Janka Gyermekotthon lakói részére. Azért választottuk őket, mert az intézmény korlátozott lehetőségei mellett nagyon nehéz megoldani, hogy megfelelően táplálják az ott lakó gyerekeket. Naponta 750 Ft áll rendelkezésükre, amiből 1 gyermek napi háromszori étkezését kell biztosítani. Ebből és a hátterükből kifolyólag nagyon sok gyermek nem is ismer egy-egy zöldséget vagy gyümölcsöt.</p>
<p>Őszintén hisszük, hogy együtt, közösen ezekkel a kis lépésekkel is segíthetünk, hogy a gyermekek mindennapjai egy picivel jobbak legyenek.</p> <h3>Kihívások</h3>
<p>Egyértelmű, hogy a kertészet sikeressége több tényezőtől is függ. Az időjárás, a kártevők és betegségek könnyen évek munkáját tehetik tönkre.</p>
<p>A családunk azonban a hosszú évek tapasztalatát felhasználva már sok mindent látott, felkészültünk. Bízunk benne, hogy szakértelmünk elég lesz ahhoz, hogy sikerrel járjunk.</p> <h3>Egyéb lehetőségek, amivel segíthetsz</h3>
<p>Ha nem tudod támogatni a projektünket kosárvásárlással, akkor is sokat tehetsz értünk! Oszd meg barátaiddal az ötletünket, segíts, hogy elérjenek minket!</p>

<h3>Short summary</h3>
<p>In the 21st Century more and more people aim to eat consciously and have healthy, chemical-free food. However, living in a big city makes that hard for most of the people.</p>
<p>Consuming more vegetables and fruits and less meat is also the key to help saving our planet.</p>
<p>Our solution is the opportunity to rent a small field from us, where we grow the healthy and delicious veggies and fruits and deliver it to the owner’s kitchen. The harvest will be distributed every week between the “owners” by the rate of their ownership and delivered to them directly.</p>
<p>Behind the project there is a couple of enthusiastic young people and a family that works in agriculture and horticulture for more than 30 years. They take care of the garden from the very beginning, from the seeding to the harvesting.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549268849/xxfvthiqyyeyikluchbd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To start the project we need 18 000 EUR investment, this is the cost of establishing a 500 m2 field with fence, irrigation system, security system, 360° camera and plant everything, raise them and at the end, deliver them.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our idea is to imagine the Farmville game in real life. The whole raising process can be followed online thru the 360° cameras and we will create a closed Facebook group. Our goal is to build a community, to share the news and even have votings about certain decisions, for example the species of the planted vegetables and fruits.</p>
<p>We love the idea of community funding! However, if we do not succeed with the funding this year, we will not give up. We will give back the money that came in, work harder on our idea and try again next year.</p>
<p>In the first year the home delivery will only be available in Budapest, Hungary.  But you can fund the project from abroad as well! In this case, your package will be sent to children’s homes.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that we can create a group of people who are committed to healthy eating and want to be a part of the whole raising process.</p>
<p>We think that we can improve the quality of people’s life by growing nutritious veggies and fruits. In the long run, we hope to raise awareness about the benefits of home-grown goods. It is getting clear that both for our body and the planet we live on the best choice is to replace most of the processed food and meat with plants. Without the disadvantages of chemicals and mass production you can nurture your body in the most natural way.</p>
<p>With the help of our funders we also want to help those who need it. After every package we send a portion of veggies and fruits to the children in the Zirzen Janka children’s home. The opportunities of the institute are limited, they have less than 3$ per day to feed one child. Many of them do not even know the different types of vegetables and fruits.</p>
<p>We really believe that with these small contributions we, together with our funders can help these children and make their lives a little bit better.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The success of the production depends on many factors. The weather, pest management and diseases can ruin years of hard work if we are not careful enough.</p>
<p>But our family has been working in horticulture for decades, so we really have seen it all, we are prepared. We believe in our competence that it'll be enough to achieve our goal.</p>

Why Should You Support Our Campaign?

Top brands want to see significant demand for the product, so your support will help us secure deals with the brands you love, and get to market faster in more markets.
The Spirit Top is at a place where significant additional funds are required.  Investors are interested but the current valuation makes raising sufficient capital difficult without giving away control. 
This product has been 100% funded thus far by the inventor, just a regular guy, who's family has made huge sacrifices, so he can pursue his dream.  We prefer to offer backers a huge discount instead of giving away the company.

 
Why Vouchers And How Will You Redeem?  

Due to legalities and regulations, offering vouchers is the only way for backers to be the first to get their hands on Spirit Tops and save some serious money in the process.
Allows backers to choose exactly which brand's product in Spirit Tops they'll receive.

Allows us to offer a delay credit as a stretch goal! (More on this after we reach our initial goal)

Who Came Up With The Spirit Top?
The Spirit Top was created by Matt Staus, a career waiter/bartender of 20+ years, who has always aspired to be an inventor and entrepreneur.  A father of 3 kids, Matt works evenings full time while dedicating his days to the pursuit of this passion.
During his journey Matt has been a part of several business from the normal e-commerce, real estate, and fitness types, to the creation of several issued or patent pending products, as well as a divorce transition services company offering non-legal logistics support for many aspects within a divorce. 
He keeps a notebook by his bed and regularly pulls it out in the middle of the night to jot down ideas.  The Spirit Top lived in that notebook for several years waiting patiently until Matt was capable of ensuring both the product and his family would be ready to handle the challenges of bringing a product like this to the market.

​​Non-Alcoholic Options

We have received a lot of requests for Non-Alcoholic options.  A large variety of flavor options would be made possible with Non-Alcoholic Spirit Tops.  
Drinks types that could benefit are:

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Gama is a restaurant concept that has been brewing for quite some time.</p>
<p>Hi, we’re David and Elyse Hopps and we have been cooking, eating and obsessing over Japanese food for the past 14 years. We have worked in restaurants specializing in all kinds of different techniques and cuisine, but for us, there is nothing better than an izakaya experience. An izakaya is a Japanese pub that serves a variety of small plates to accompany the alcoholic beverages. We are hoping to create a restaurant where people feel comfortable and taken care of. A place where people can go after a long day, where they can celebrate or relax. We truly believe that we can create that restaurant for our community. </p>
<p>Gama has been operating as a pop-up for the past seven months. We are building out the restaurant and are hoping to open our doors by the end of June. This campaign is so important to us, because it will give us that final push to really hit the ground running, and reopen for our community and all of the friends we’ve made so far. Your continued support means the world to us. Thank you for believing in Gama! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Let’s Break It Down</h3>
<p>As you know, this is the final push. We are building out the restaurant and finally putting all of ourselves into our permanent space. Our dreams are becoming reality. Additional funding would be extremely helpful as we navigate through our opening costs. </p>
<p>Opening a restaurant is scary in the best of times, so having a cushion as we launch during a pandemic would be such a weight lifted. This money will go towards a brand new point of sale system, opening food and beverage purchases and small wares just to name a few. </p>
<p>Contributing doesn’t just mean that you are supporting our restaurant, you are also purchasing the best that we have to offer. We’re offering our house made togarashi, our delicious yuzu sesame dressing and the infamous fried chicken finishing dust. Speaking of fried chicken, we are offering that up as well! Can you imagine coming in to the restaurant and already having karaage paid for? Want to give a little extra? We’re offering private dinners, private parties and sake tastings. </p>
<p>The idea for this campaign actually came from our guests. We can’t express to you how much it means to us that, on top of supporting the pop-up, you have an interest in supporting us in such a huge way. We want these offers to be fun and special, because that’s what you are to us! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It’s not going to be a shock to anyone when we say, we’re going through a pandemic. It might be a shock to tell you that we decided to open a restaurant, during said pandemic. Times are tough for everyone right now, and the fear that it won’t get better is looming. Right now, we are able to open at 50% occupancy. We have no idea if that will be the case in June, but we are hopeful that things are getting better not just for us, but for our community and across the world. </p>
<p>Of course we are fearful of what the future holds, but we are also hopeful that we can provide a safe space for people. These contributions will absolutely help in providing a little bit of comfort as we move forward into the unknown. </p>

Art of the Spirits Whiskey LLC is a Colorado based business that is accredited, licensed, and locally owned and operated company. Richard Paul, the Founder of Art of the Spirits Whiskey LLC, is born and raised in Denver, Colorado. Since 2014, Richard has put his knowledge, ingenuity skill, and passion into creating and developing the most unique and solely limited edition American whiskey brand.  Richard's extensive art background stems from the past nine years of working with world renown Artists, Danial James &amp; David Uhl (licensed Artist by Harley-Davidson) in Golden, Colorado.</p>

<h3><strong>Company History</strong></h3>
<p><strong>In October of 2016</strong>, Art of the Spirits Whiskey LLC released our first gold medal winning limited edition of 450 ""Krule 2B Kind"" and 450 ""Pure Elegance"" Bourbon Whiskey bottles. We commissioned Danial James to photo shoot an elegant scenery of a local model and hand paint an oil painting from that reference photo which then created our limited edition bourbon whiskey labels. Our bourbon was one hundred percent corn and aged three years in a new 30 gallon American oak barrel. It has a caramel corn nose that compliments its elegant gold shine with a sweet oak up front, caramel, &amp; cinnamon taste &amp; a hint of smooth earthy oak finish.

<p>We're getting ready to release our next limited edition whiskey series that is inspired by the famous American Outlaws; Bonnie Parker &amp; Clyde Barrow! Bonnie and Clyde were fans of American whiskey, and was known to throw empty bottles from the window of their getaway car while Clyde took the wheel.</p>
<p>Bonnie Parker (October 1, 1910–May 23, 1934) and Clyde Barrow (March 24, 1909–May 23, 1934) went on a notorious two-year crime spree during the Great Depression, a time when the American public was hostile toward government. Bonnie and Clyde used that emotion to their advantage: Assuming an image closer to Robin Hood's than to the mass murderers they were, they captured the nation's imagination as a romantic young couple on the open road.</p>

Art of the Spirits Whiskey LLC is a Colorado based business that is accredited, licensed, and locally owned and operated company. Richard Paul, the Founder of Art of the Spirits Whiskey LLC, is born and raised in Denver, Colorado.

Company History
In October of 2016, Art of the Spirits Whiskey LLC released our first gold medal winning limited edition of 450 ""Krule 2B Kind"" and 450 ""Pure Elegance"" Bourbon Whiskey bottles. We commissioned Danial James to photo shoot an elegant scenery of a local model and hand paint an oil painting from that reference photo which then created our limited edition bourbon whiskey labels. Our bourbon was one hundred percent corn and aged three years in a new 30 gallon American oak barrel. It has a caramel corn nose that compliments its elegant gold shine with a sweet oak up front, caramel, & cinnamon taste & a hint of smooth earthy oak finish. We've proudly SOLD OUT of these bottles in March of 2017.
We entered our bourbon whiskey at the 2016 Still on the Hill's double-blind tasting competition in Breckenridge, Colorado and we are proud to say we went up against Colorado's top craft distilleries and we took home a Gold medal!

In August of 2017, we released a limited edition of 600 ""Easy Elegance"" Rye Whiskey bottles by renown Artist, Danial James.

<p>We pride ourselves in service, guaranteeing a smile with every order.  We hope you will remember us for our savory food, our quality service and mostly, our fun environment.  </p>

<h3>Bain's Craft Hot Sauce</h3>
<p>I'm Kyle Bain, I live in Ellensburg, WA and I'm starting a hot sauce company. For the past few years I have been making all kinds of hot sauce in my free time. I've been trying out different peppers, vinegars, fermenting and aging processes. I would share my sauces with family and friends, take their feedback to heart and tweak the recipes along the way. In doing so, I've created some sauces that I want to share with a wider audience. So here I am starting Bain's Craft Hot Sauce and I'm hoping you can help me out.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am in need of your help to get Bain's off the ground. Your contributions will come with some sweet perks. Here they are...</p>
<ul>
<li>Stickers, featuring the Bain's logo as designed by local Ellensburg artist Justin Gibbens.</li>
<li>Bottles of Green Go (mild), Vampire Hunter (medium) and Straight Red (hot).</li>
<li>T-Shirts with the Bain's logo.</li>
<li>In the higher dollar range are some pretty intriguing rewards. One bottle of hot sauce a week for a year? Yep. Your own hot sauce co-created by you? Uh-huh. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I believe that fermented foods have a seriously good impact on ones health. I also really love hot sauce. Like, too much. So why not combine the two? The first few batches of hot sauce were made with fresh peppers, vegetables, fruits and spices.  They were good sauces. Fresh is good. But once I started making fermented sauces, I found that the flavor was taken to another level. So I ran with it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>Mid June/early July is the rough timeframe that I have set for your rewards to arrive. However, if for any reason there are delay, I will be sure to keep you updated. </p>

That's why we're running an Indiegogo campaign asking for you to help us start a hot drinks revolution.  We've been busy...As you can see we haven't been resting on our laurels, we have been through countless iterations of the Glowstone heated smart mug since our first design back in 2015. We have expanded the Glowstone team to 6 incredibly talented people, and we've been filmed by 2 national TV channels and had a whole load of press. If we can fund this next stage in the development it means we will be retail ready. We already have buyers across the UK, Middle East and Asia ready and waiting, so we need you to bring this project to life. As soon as the Glowstone mugs go on sale they will, in most cases be over £100 so this is also the last opportunity to become an early adopter of this timeless product at a discounted price.About the inventor The Glowstone mug was invented by Glowstone's founder, Thomas Gostelow. Educated as a mechanical engineer, in his first year after graduation, Thomas invented a new medical procedure and filed 4 patents. The medical advances that he pioneered at the age of just 23 continue to save lives today. He has worked as a product designer ever since.Thomas' flair for innovation was clear from the outset. His ultimate ambition was to be able to bring his own ideas to life himself. Throughout the rest of his career, Thomas was careful to gain the key business skills needed to help fulfil his goal.He hopes that you will support his journey. Join the hot drinks revolution today and say farewell to cold, flavourless beverages. Your hot drink deserves better. By supporting our campaign you'll give us the investment we need to improve hot drinks across the world and help us on our journey to optimise everyday products for everyone. When they hit the shelves, our mugs will cost a lot more so you'll also be one of the lucky few that snap up a mug for way less than retail. Thanks so much for stopping by. If you have any questions please do let us know!",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi everyone! My name is Alia Jaziri, and I'm the founder of Medina.  Thanks for taking the time to visit the campaign page for my first official restaurant venture.  </p>
<p>Over the past year, I've been working tirelessly on Medina's concept development and evolution.  Whether it was hosting pop-ups in San Francisco and San Diego, or participating in Google's food entrepreneur incubator program.  I've had the opportunity to develop my own food truck concept and gain hands-on experience with the ins-and-outs of scaled production and customer service within the food industry.</p>
<p>Through Google's program, I was deeply inspired to further expand Medina's reach by opening a brick-and-mortar location in my hometown of San Diego.  Each of your contributions, large or small, will assist me in making my dream of opening up my own restaurant a reality. </p>
<p><strong>Medina will be a refined, fast-casual restaurant &amp; wine bar in San Diego - specializing in fresh Moroccan food with a Baja-California spin.</strong>  Our mission is to enlighten the community with cuisine that highlights quality ingredients and bold flavors, while providing excellent customer service and a lively experience customers will want to continually share with friends and family.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Breakdown: </h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $10,000 over the next 45 days. The funds will go towards: Hosting additional pop-ups (for recipe feedback, marketing and brand awareness), securing the perfect neighborhood location, designing the space to reflect Medina's warm and modern aesthetic, and officially opening our restaurant in Spring 2018.</p>
<p>We also have some lovely perks available in exchange for your contribution!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact, Our Vision and Mission</h3>
<p>Medina’s primary goal is to serve excellent tasting food and drinks, while creating a unique, lively atmosphere for our customers.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Our mission is to provide our clientele with paramount customer service and a stellar dining experience they will eagerly tell their friends about.  Medina will be the restaurant of choice for an adult crowd looking for a quick to-go bite or a casual sit down meal and drink in a vibrant neighborhood locale.</li>
<li>Our concept combines great food with a superior ambiance and friendly staff, to create a sense of 'place' in order to reach our goal of overall value in the dining experience. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Pesky Inevitable Speed Bumps</h3>
<p>I am fully aware that opening up even a small restaurant is no easy venture.  But no frets my pets, I'm not simply running on blind passion for cooking and hosting dinners. </p>
<p>Last year, I knew that I was taking a huge leap of faith by leaving my job in tech to shift into a field I had a relatively superficial knowledge of.  But with that self awareness, I've made it a point to work in restaurants, and challenge myself in new ways to learn and grow on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In addition to my personal mindset and goals for Medina, I have an advisory board of amazing individuals who are 35 yr+ seasoned veterans in operating successful businesses and restaurants. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Spread the Word!</h3>
<p>Know people in San Diego that would enjoy my delectable treats?  Help me spread the good word on those social media accounts (you are hanging out there all day anyways, right?) Twitter, Facebook, Instagram!</p>
<p>There are tons of share tools directly within this campaign, or just do a good ol' copy and paste action.  I'd be so thankful for any and all support you could provide!</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your time, love and continued support with making Medina come alive.</p>

<h2>Our Story </h2>
<p>During a recent trek to the Himalayas, I wondered, why aren’t there any energy snacks made with Tsampa?  My parents are from Tibet and would make Tsampa as a treat – but I wasn’t aware of the <strong>great nutrition and long-lasting energy</strong> benefit until my trek up to Mt. Everest.  I got to work when I returned to Seattle, developing numerous recipes and asking local Sherpa friends and professional mountain guides for feedback.  Everything – from flavor, nutrition, packaging, size, and shape – was tested and optimized, creating the ultimate energy snack for your next outdoor adventure.  Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Why Peak Sherpa Energy Balls? </h2>

<p>Peak Sherpa Energy Balls are designed for activity. Mountaineers and climbing guides told us they rarely eat a whole energy bar at one time and prefer to eat in small chunks when they're physically active. Perfectly portioned energy balls are ideal for fueling on the go. Plus, with 8 energy balls per pack, it’s easy to share with friends and family!</p>

<p>Our packaging is unique, with a <strong>resealable </strong>peel-back opening - the first of its kind in the US energy bar market. Now you can fuel as you go, eat as much or as little as you need. No more half-eaten energy bars collecting lint in your backpack! </p>

<p>Peak Sherpa Energy Balls are made with <strong>Tsampa </strong>(pronounced sahm'-pa), a sprouted &amp; roasted high mountain barley. It’s a great source of fiber rich complex carbohydrates, providing long-lasting energy and satiety. For centuries, people across the Himalayas, including Sherpa mountaineers, have relied on Tsampa as their go-to source for long-lasting energy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By working with Sherpa guides and mountain climbing communities in the Pacific Northwest, we’ve created an energy snack with the ideal <strong>balanced nutrition for outdoor adventures</strong>.  These elite mountain guides wanted the quick energy that typically comes with energy gels, but also something more wholesome, nutritious and long lasting.  By combining simple and complex carbohydrates, essential complete proteins, fat, fiber, and electrolytes, Peak Sherpa Energy Balls deliver the ideal snack for these elite endurance athletes… and you!</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Made with Organic Ingredients </h2>
<p>Our Amala (mother in Tibetan) instilled in us the importance of fueling our bodies with wholesome and healthy foods.  So we created Peak Sherpa Energy Balls using all natural, organic ingredients like crunchy Tsampa, egg whites, pea protein, brown rice syrup, almond butter, and Himalayan pink salt - so you can feel good about what you're eating while enjoying the balanced nutrition and great taste!</p>

At Quokka Brew, we partnered with food scientists and chemists to develop our patent-pending blend of organic vasodilators, which dilates blood vessels back to their natural state, and allows blood to flow more freely. This keeps our heart rates constant and prevents the onset of jitters.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/mB9Whblv7BMXq1cP9d/source.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Our jitterless blend also helps counteract the all-too-familiar coffee crash, which usually occurs when the energizing effects of caffeine wear off.

<strong>Why</strong><strong> We Need Your Help:</strong>

Our patent-pending blend, made of organic amino acids and brain-boosting nootropics, counteracts the jitters and crash from caffeine—without sacrificing any of the energy. Each Quokka Brew is made using fair trade cold brew coffee, rich and creamy oat milk, exotic vanilla from Madagascar, and our jitterless blend. But, it’s more than just jitterless...  We crafted one of the healthiest coffees on the market, dairy-free and vegan with only 3 grams of sugar and 90 calories per can. This enables us to enjoy a tasty coffee that’s guilt-free. To top it all off, each Quokka Brew has as much caffeine as a cup and a half of normal coffee (135mg), all packaged in an 8.4oz infinitely-recyclable aluminum can. Hack Your Morning Routine:What Does Jitterless Coffee Feel Like?  As Healthy as It Gets. We focus on what goes in, so you can focus on what comes out. We sourced fair trade coffee and the highest quality organic ingredients to ensure that what you put into your body not only tastes good, but also is good.What the Press is Saying: So, How Does It Work?Caffeine is naturally a vasoconstrictor, meaning it constricts our blood vessels—leading to a decrease in blood flow. This causes our hearts to pump harder in order to maintain blood flow, resulting in the jitters and shakes. At Quokka Brew, we partnered with food scientists and chemists to develop our patent-pending blend of organic vasodilators, which dilates blood vessels back to their natural state, and allows blood to flow more freely. This keeps our heart rates constant and prevents the onset of jitters.  Our jitterless blend also helps counteract the all-too-familiar coffee crash, which usually occurs when the energizing effects of caffeine wear off. Quokka Brew was designed to have the perfect ratio of caffeine to amino acids and nootropics, in order to ensure steady energy levels throughout your day. Our Organic Ingredients:

<h3><strong>The Story of OddFellows</strong></h3>
<p>OddFellows Ice Cream Co. is a Brooklyn-based, family-run business founded by Chef Sam Mason (co-owner/head chef) and husband-and-wife team Mohan and Holiday Kumar.</p>
<p>Our story begins in the summer of 2011, when Holiday was pregnant with her twins. One night, Mohan was sharing a few drinks with his buddy Sam, and telling him about Holiday's latest food cravings: fried chicken, grilled cheese sandwiches … and salty-flavored ice cream. Being the fine fellow that he was, Sam whipped up his signature pretzel ice cream - famous from his wd~50 days - for Holiday. He packed a pint and brought it over. It lasted five minutes. His ice cream was unlike anything she had ever tasted. ""You guys should sell this stuff,"" she said. Mohan thought so too and approached Sam with the idea. Let's say, it didn't take much convincing.</p>
<p>Nearly two years of planning later, OddFellows Ice Cream Co. will open for business. We will be located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn on Kent Avenue, between North 3<sup>rd</sup> and North 4<sup>th</sup> Streets (just 3 blocks from Bedford Avenue, 2 blocks from Smorgasburg/Brooklyn Flea and a stone's throw from the East River), and are slated to open on Thursday, June 6th.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><strong>What Makes Our Ice Cream Different?</strong></h3>
<p>First and foremost, all of our ice cream will be made from scratch in our kitchen, which not too many ice cream shops can boast. Most ice cream shops that promise ""homemade"" actually throw flavors into a pre-made ice cream base. That's not homemade! OddFellows Ice Cream Co. <em>will </em>be homemade. At the helm will be Chef Sam Mason (Empire Mayonnaise, wd~50, Tailor, Lady Jay’s). If you recognize the name, you know his culinary endeavors are delectably unconventional …now just wait until you taste his ice cream.</p>
<p>Chef Mason will pasteurize our base in-house. By making the ice cream in this manner, OddFellows will be able to deliver the highest quality and freshest product possible. Pasteurizing our base will also give us the freedom to concoct the most distinctive and scrumptious flavors. We will be able to individually infuse each batch's mix to add depth and scope to each flavor. Nothing tastes better than homemade!</p>
<p>As for our ingredients, we source our milk, eggs, and cream from local farms and will, whenever possible, use in season, all natural ingredients. While our flavors will always be changing, we offer 8 to 10 ice cream flavors along with 2 to 4 sorbets daily. Our flavors will range from the odd and unconventional to inventive renditions of the classics. OddFellows will also have a full soda program (all homemade by Chef Mason), baked goods, candy, and other treats.</p>

All pre-buy packages will get you a punchcard that you can use at your leisure, valid for one year, to claim your pints.</span></p>
<p>That said, we realize not everyone can take part in the pre-sale. That's OK. There are other equally helpful ways to contribute.

<h3>Tastes Great, Less Calories</h3>
<p>The past 20 years have seen an explosion of creativity in the beer industry as thousands of small breweries have emerged with a passion to serve their local communities with full-flavored beers that bring a uniquely American character to Old World recipes.</p>
<p>However, one goal has eluded the best efforts of every brewmaster: to create a “light” craft beer for health-conscious beer drinkers who are counting their calories. Mad Hops is trying to change all that by creating an IPA-flavored beer with under 100 calories.</p>
<p>Launched late last year with six varieties - Pale Ale, Irish Porter, Cherry Wheat, Apple Amber, Mexican Lime and Wild Blueberry - Mad Hops Flavored Beer Drops enhance the flavor, aroma and color of any pale American lager, including light beers like Bud Light and Michelob Ultra. And it only adds 5 calories per 12-ounce serving.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498479230/fimuqe4fi1wzjgwbf5s3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We’re not saying we can turn a Bud Light into a craft beer, but it’s the next best thing. But don't take our word for it! Watch the crew at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjP6SrPJSzY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Beerded Adventures</a> as they test the 4 major light beer brands and are amazed at how Mad Hops transforms them into something tastier.

<h3>We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>Creating an IPA flavor will be our ultimate challenge. We’re going to work closely with our partners in the craft brewing world to find the right combination of genuine beer ingredients like hops, malts, bitters to add the depth and complexity of an IPA to a light beer. Proceeds from the Indiegogo campaign will be used to defray the cost of this extensive development process.</p>
<p>We’re going to need your help too. Participants in the campaign will get to help us choose what type of IPA to imitate; then during the development process we’ll send samples to our Indiegogo Taste Testers for evaluation. We’ll compile the results and feed them to our development team. That will keep us on track!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>BeerAdvocate featured Mad Hops in an article in their May issue - <a href=""https://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/15796/the-power-is-yours-customizing-the-drinker-experience/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Power Is Yours: Customizing the Drinker Experience</a>. A lot of people today want to personalize their beer-drinking experience. The explosion of new craft varieties has raised our expectations of how a beer should taste, and we are taking matters into our own hands and changing the flavor of our not-so-flavorful store-bought brews.</p>
<p>Mad Hops' mission is to enable beer lovers to “have it your way.” Want to splurge on the latest IPA from that local microbrewery you heard about? Go for it! Got a thirst for a plain and simple pale American lager on a hot day? We’re not judging you. Feel the need to pursue some hoppiness and add a squirt of Mad Hops to your Bud Light? God bless you!</p>
<p>Let’s ask Shana Martz, a 33-year-old beer lover from Columbus, Ohio, what she thinks. BeerAdvocate did, and she told him she always carries a bottle of Mad Hops Wild Blueberry and Cherry Wheat in her purse for when she feels like drinking something more flavorful. We love you too, Shana!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Please Help Us!</h3>
<p>If you agree that people should be able to enjoy a light beer flavored any way they want, please share this campaign with your friends. Creating an IPA-flavored beer with under 100 calories is an ambitious goal. Some would say it can’t be done, but with your help, we know we can do it.</p>
<p>Let's make some history! :-)</p>

<p>Collapsible food containers are everywhere today, but this is not your standard silicone collapsible. The <strong><i>Fill n Zip </i></strong>Cup has been designed specifically to securely hold quart and gallon sized seal-top bags while you fill them with food, soup or leftovers. It's never been so simple and easy!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522598579/xhswelnkc9aethifzqmk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Just grab the nearest seal-top bag and tuck it inside, wrapping the zipper-top or slider down around the rim. This keeps the seal clean and out of the way, because who wants food in there? (Nobody, that’s who. We took a survey.)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522598604/a6fpqyhu5xeykctm4wuu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our prototype testing quickly showed us that round cups weren’t wide enough to catch food poured from larger bowls and pans. (Mistakes were made.) With that lesson in hand, we designed <strong><i>Fill n Zip </i></strong>with just the right proportions to fit your bags and still let you pour from a wide bowl or pan without spilling your delicious leftovers all over the counter top. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522598695/pm4kugtxdaxv7tzzb5cl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>What’s that you say? How did we make sure it won’t fall over at the crucial moment? <strong>We’re glad you asked</strong>. We gave <strong><i>Fill n Zip </i></strong>rubber feet to widen its stance and keep it stable in the middle of the action. That silicone is flexible enough for collapsible gymnastics, but we also made sure to keep the base thick enough for sturdy, reliable footing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522598720/sbjd2vborrzrkfdym3vj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And if you’re worried about shaky hands or poor coordination, <strong>we still have you covered</strong>. If you’re working on a smooth, clean surface, you can suction this sucker down by simply loading your seal-top bag in <strong><i>Fill n Zip </i></strong>and simply depressing on the inside of the cup.</p>

<h3>What we need and how can you help?</h3>
<p>This seems like a fairly simple project, but it has taken time and development cost to get it to this point. We have thousands of dollars invested in samples and testing to make sure they are perfect, and the production molds will cost several thousands of dollars each for these two different sizes. These days, creating and producing videos are expensive, so we'll easily have invested over $10,000 before any production begins.</p>
<p>Pledgers on Kickstarter and Indiegogo have helped launch the first Zip n Store products and we really APPRECIATE YOU and your support that you gave us to launch our initial campaign. So, we want you to be the first to be able to get <strong><i>Fill n Zip</i></strong>. We want you to be able to fill your seal-top bags completely mess free!! So please take some time and pledge on the <strong><i>Fill n Zip</i></strong><i>.</i></p>

<h3>Why are we doing this? </h3>

<h3>Your Impact...</h3>
<p>Did you know that the average american family spends over <strong>$1,400 on foods that are wasted every year?</strong> Your foods and leftovers get tossed into the refrigerator and get lost and hidden. They eventually get thrown away and that is money out of your pocket. That's why Zip n Store was created, to help organize foods and leftovers and this is why it is so powerful. Now you can see and organize your foods in the refrigerator, pantry, cabinet and more. Now your foods that you work so hard to pay for are all right at your fingertips. Now you can save your money and spend it on something you really want!  </p>

The Fill n Zip Cup has been designed specifically to securely hold quart and gallon sized seal-top bags while you fill them with food, soup or leftovers. It's never been so simple and easy!

Just grab the nearest seal-top bag and tuck it inside, wrapping the zipper-top or slider down around the rim. This keeps the seal clean and out of the way, because who wants food in there? (Nobody, that’s who. We took a survey.)

Our prototype testing quickly showed us that round cups weren’t wide enough to catch food poured from larger bowls and pans. (Mistakes were made.) With that lesson in hand, we designed Fill n Zip with just the right proportions to fit your bags and still let you pour from a wide bowl or pan without spilling your delicious leftovers all over the counter top. 

What’s that you say? How did we make sure it won’t fall over at the crucial moment? We’re glad you asked. We gave Fill n Zip rubber feet to widen its stance and keep it stable in the middle of the action. That silicone is flexible enough for collapsible gymnastics, but we also made sure to keep the base thick enough for sturdy, reliable footing.

And if you’re worried about shaky hands or poor coordination, we still have you covered. If you’re working on a smooth, clean surface, you can suction this sucker down by simply loading your seal-top bag in Fill n Zip and simply depressing on the inside of the cup.

I'm Mai, and I started maivino because I wanted to make high-quality wine affordable for all by eliminating waste in the wine industry.

                               This year, while sourcing for red wine, I was shocked to learn from a 2nd generation winegrower/maker from Willamette Valley, that tons of high-quality, Pinot Noir from the award-winning Willamette Valley, were going to be left to rot on the vine. These grapes were not getting picked because when there is a glut of wine in the market, small growers who don't have long-term contracts have a hard time finding buyers. Many are forced to make wine and risk not selling it, while others will just let the grapes die. That's when eureka struck - I realized, that if I saved these grapes, I could deliver high-quality wine at half the price.  So in October, I headed to Oregon to put a down payment on the grapes and help harvest it. I now need your help to make these grapes into fine wine. Your upside? By investing in these wines, you'll get Pinot Noir from the award-winning Willamette Valley at half the price.Our winemaker uses the same grapes to make wine that has a 4.2 rating on Vivino and retails at $30.

<p>As a self-confessed food enthusiast and amateur chef, I wanted to own the very best kitchen knives I could find. And I wanted them to be the cornerstone of my housewares company, <b>Habitat</b>. What I soon learned, though, was that not much has changed in knife-making in over <b>200 years</b>!</p></figure></div><p>Knife manufacturers have tried to address the same problems for centuries. The steel may be too soft, the knives get dull quickly, they need lots of maintenance, and they may react with food. Ceramic knives have problems, too. They can be brittle and break easily.</p><p>I felt certain there must be a way to move knife-making into the 21st century. My search led me to a remarkable metal alloy initially developed by <b>Caltech</b> and tested by <b>NASA</b> – and later patented. I acquired the rights to use this metal alloy and set about determining how best to use it in making a game-changing chef knife that would reinvent the industry and become the new standard.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/xUNd9IhK4fLCHOOBSE/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512616095/fi0ccymzgxjzbp6aanoh.png"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""18818364""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>A kitchen knife’s </span><b style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>sharpness</b><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> is THE most critical attribute – and the knife edge angle is the critical factor that determines sharpness. The harder the material is, the sharper the blade can be made.

VERY expensive knives, costing hundreds of dollars, are made from higher carbon steel that is brittle and can rust. High carbon steel hardness can reach the low 60s on the Rockwell scale. (And it is interesting to note that two other popular and successful crowdfunded knives only have Rockwell hardness in the higher 50s.) <b>The Habitat Kitchen Knives blow away the competition with a 70+ reading on the Rockwell scale! </b></p><div data-id=""18828095""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""The CATRA Analysis Shows the Sharpness and Durability Superiority of Habitat Kitchen Knives"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1511988021/seguvlcoqzq5crki5cat.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p>The CATRA Analysis Shows the Sharpness and Durability Superiority of Habitat Kitchen Knives</p></figcaption></figure></div><p>Most importantly, the <b>Habitat Kitchen Knives</b> surpass anything else on the market. They hold their edge better and longer due to the hardness of the metal alloy. And they aren’t brittle because the blade is steel but the edge is the patented metal alloy.

Blade edge is extra-sharp and stays sharp 5 times longer than other knives
Edge is made with patented alloy, developed by Caltech and tested by NASA

Alloy is twice as strong as titanium

Our patent-pending process bonds the alloy to a stainless steel knife body
Each knife priced under $100, yet better than most professional knives costing hundreds of dollars

The New NASA-Inspired Habitat Santoku Knife    
Chefs from Coast to Coast Love the Habitat Knives! (Testimonials below.)  Last year my team and I ran a very successful crowdfunding campaign for the Habitat Chef Knife. The response was overwhelming! Home cooks and professional chefs alike just love the knife’s sharpness and durability, and positive reviews poured in. But we had many people asking if we would be introducing other knives as well, so this year we are launching our new Santoku and Paring Knives!
As a self-confessed food enthusiast and amateur chef, I wanted to own the very best kitchen knives I could find. And I wanted them to be the cornerstone of my housewares company, Habitat. What I soon learned, though, was that not much has changed in knife-making in over 200 years!Knife manufacturers have tried to address the same problems for centuries. The steel may be too soft, the knives get dull quickly, they need lots of maintenance, and they may react with food. Ceramic knives have problems, too. They can be brittle and break easily.I felt certain there must be a way to move knife-making into the 21st century. My search led me to a remarkable metal alloy initially developed by Caltech and tested by NASA – and later patented. I acquired the rights to use this metal alloy and set about determining how best to use it in making a game-changing chef knife that would reinvent the industry and become the new standard.A kitchen knife’s sharpness is THE most critical attribute – and the knife edge angle is the critical factor that determines sharpness. The harder the material is, the sharper the blade can be made. But in ordinary steel knives, a higher level of hardness also makes the knife harder to maintain, and the edge chips easily. The edge on all three Habitat Kitchen Knives is made from this Caltech and NASA developed metal alloy, which is harder than any steel yet isn’t brittle and resists rust.The hardness of a metal alloy is measured utilizing the Rockwell (HRC) testing standard. VERY expensive knives, costing hundreds of dollars, are made from higher carbon steel that is brittle and can rust. High carbon steel hardness can reach the low 60s on the Rockwell scale. (And it is interesting to note that two other popular and successful crowdfunded knives only have Rockwell hardness in the higher 50s.) The Habitat Kitchen Knives blow away the competition with a 70+ reading on the Rockwell scale! The CATRA Analysis Shows the Sharpness and Durability Superiority of Habitat Kitchen KnivesMost importantly, the Habitat Kitchen Knives surpass anything else on the market. They hold their edge better and longer due to the hardness of the metal alloy. And they aren’t brittle because the blade is steel but the edge is the patented metal alloy. The combination of hardness, high elasticity, and corrosion resistance makes the metal alloy edge wear resistant.This superior alloy also allows us to sustain an aggressive angle for our edge of just 12.5 degrees on each side for a total of 25 degrees. (Most knives are manufactured with a combined angle of 30 degrees.) What does this mean? The sharper the angle, the easier and more precise the cut.The Habitat Kitchen Knives are ultra-sharp and last 5 times longer than ordinary knives.   The patented metal alloy edge possesses a natural nano-serration at the molecular level. This serration is like microscopic, ultra-hard “teeth” that are what make the effortless and breathtaking cutting power of the Habitat Kitchen Knives possible. 
The Habitat Kitchen Knives’ Nano-Serration Is What Cuts Tomatoes, Meat, and Crusty Bread Equally WellAnother benefit of this nano-serration is the self-sharpening aspect of the microscopic teeth. As the knife is used, these tiny teeth are exposed and essentially sharpen themselves – and this is part of what allows the Habitat Kitchen Knives to retain their ultimate edge far longer than other knives. It wasn’t enough to just acquire the use of the NASA-tested metal alloy. We needed to develop a process for bonding this metal alloy to the high-quality stainless steel knife blanks that would comprise the Habitat Kitchen Knives. This required the time and effort to perfect the process shown in this video clip. The patent-pending edge bonding process is what sets the Habitat Kitchen Knives apart as the new standard of excellence. We believe this patented process will revolutionize the knife-making industry.While my Habitat Chef Knife reinvented the category with its revolutionary edge, there are still proven knife features that matter – and I made certain they are included in the design of all the Habitat Kitchen Knives.Here are a few:
The tip is thin and sharp for precise detail cutting.
Perfect weight so the knives feels like a balanced extension of your hand.
A gorgeous, distinctive handle that is ergonomically designed and made from beautiful pakka wood.
  The Habitat Chef Knife is hands down the most important knife in your collection. At 14.1 inches in total length and 8 inches in blade length, the Habitat Chef Knife has a wider blade than most and is also a bit longer. The reason why this is an advantage to the user is because the wider blade allows for more cutting area, making the knife more efficient and easier to use. The longer blade allows for more precise cuts, and it’s safer compared to smaller chef knives.Another unique attribute of the Habitat Chef Knife is that for its size it is extremely lightweight and easy to maneuver. Unlike with heavier chef knives, you will be able to use the Habitat Chef Knife for long periods of time without feeling fatigue or cramping in your hand.Habitat Santoku KnifeThe Habitat Santoku Knife measures 11.7 inches in total length and 7 inches in blade length. I consider this knife to be the workhorse of the group. Combining the features of a cleaver and a chef’s knife, this multipurpose knife minces, dices and slices. I love my chef knife, but I find myself using my Santoku knife just as much around the kitchen simply because it’s so fun to cut with. Having said that, we designed our Santoku knife to be as stylish as it is practical.We have included a Granton edge — those are the dimples you see on the sides of the blade that keep things from sticking to the knife. This helps when cutting items that retain water, such as tomatoes. Our Santoku knife is lightweight and extremely durable, and, along with our chef and paring knives, it really is a must have.Habitat Paring KnifeThe Habitat Paring Knife is just the right size. At 6.33 inches in total length and 3.27 inches in blade length, this indispensable knife is basically a smaller version of the chef knife. It’s best utilized for slicing and mincing items that are too small for the chef knife. The paring knife is perfect for cuts that require precision and attention to detail, such as peeling, trimming and slicing small fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, shallots and garlic, to name a few.The Habitat Paring Knife takes all of our key design attributes into consideration and focuses on delivering the shape and size needed to make every type of cut. This video clip shares some of our design process with you: Other knife-makers talk endlessly about the minor differences between their knives and others. They show pictures and diagrams and go on and on. Yes, these features matter, and I’ve paid close attention to them, too, as you have seen.But these others don’t have anything more important and different to talk about. I do!The sharpness and durability of my superior knife edge will become the GOLD STANDARD for knives.See for Yourself! Below is a chart that shows FIVE important attributes desirable in a quality kitchen knife – sharpness, durability, food safety, food taste, and being corrosion free. See for yourself how the Habitat Kitchen Knives compare to the competition. We aren’t afraid to name names. Another important comparison is price – and we all know price is driven by value. Yes, there are knives that cost less, and there are knives that cost more. In fact, there are kitchen knives costing hundreds of dollars more. But if their cutting edge is not harder (and NONE have a harder edge), then they can’t match the performance of our knife. That means the value of the Habitat Kitchen Knives simply can’t be beat!
Who would know better about the performance of kitchen knives than professional chefs? I have placed our prototype knives with a significant number of professional chefs – and the accolades are pouring in! See and hear for yourself what these chefs have to say about the Habitat Kitchen Knives in their own words!  

 

      And it’s not just professional chefs who are raving about our Habitat Kitchen Knives, either. Home cooks love them as well! Many have never had the pleasure before of owning a professional-grade knife at a fraction of the cost, but now they can — and so can you!  Frankly, I can talk about the great performance of the Habitat Kitchen Knives all day long. But my opinion will never be as persuasive as those of these professional chefs and home cooks. They have all rigorously tested our superior kitchen knives in their restaurants and home kitchens and have shared their honest and candid opinions. There are more than a few “war stories” about Kickstarter projects that have failed to deliver their rewards in even close to a timely manner. I am not proud to admit it, but we did run into some challenges during our previous campaign. We had a terrible experience working with our fulfillment center. This caused some issues, as well as backers changing addresses at the last minute or not replying to the surveys and then sending emails asking us why they hadn't received their knives.....lol....live and learn. Now, having one successful campaign under our belts, we know exactly what to expect and are extremely prepared to deliver what we say when we say we will.  Not only do I want to reward you for backing my project, but I also want to be certain you receive your reward when promised.We are so confident that we’re going to deliver your knives on time and as promised that if we don’t, we’ll refund 100% of your initial pledge. Such guarantees are rare in crowdfunding, but I am doing it to make your decision to pledge that much easier.IMPORTANT NOTE: This guarantee applies only to the regular scheduled delivery of Habitat Kitchen Knives in April 2018, not to the Holiday Delivery specials. Be sure to check out our Earlybird reward tiers over to the right. You’ll be able to get a special bonus gift — my Habitat Weight Wizard Digital Scale (more about this in a minute) — by pledging early. These early pledges help us to get the campaign off to a good start, and we are happy to reward you by giving you this delightful digital food scale with our compliments!  Our Blue Light Specials in our last campaign were so successful that by popular demand, we are bringing them back! You can pledge to receive one each of our three Habitat Kitchen Knives (Chef, Santoku, and Paring) and get the FREE Bonus of one Habitat Weight Wizard Digital Kitchen Scale.The Weight Wizard Digital Kitchen Scale is one of my Habitat products and normally sells for $27 — but it is your BONUS with this reward, at no extra charge, for your support. Look for this reward to the right — called the Blue Light Special. Don’t miss out — pledge now!The Habitat WEIGHT WIZARD Digital Kitchen Scale
 Starting a business and creating a new product is no easy task. And it requires capital! Thanks to the amazing support from this community, I’ve been able to go into production with our Habitat Chef Knife and bring it to market. Now it is time to raise money to take the next step and launch our Santoku and Paring Knives — so here we are on Kickstarter again.The money we raise this time around will be used to continue to expand our product line, help fund additional custom tooling, purchase more equipment, stock more raw materials, and hire more skilled labor. Your support can help make this possible!We’re so excited to get these new knives into your hands and your kitchens. And with your support, I know we can do it! Cooking Becomes a True Pleasure with the Habitat Kitchen Knives If you're a cooking enthusiast and you’ve read this far, it is almost certain you have some kind of cooking knives in your kitchen. Maybe they are depressingly ordinary — or maybe you thought you were getting something special but it didn’t turn out that way. Or, maybe you spent a lot of money on what you have.No matter what knives you have or how you got them, your knives are only variations on what has been available for over 200 years!Now you will have the chance to be among the very first to have one or more kitchen knives that will be the game-changers that redefine the category because they reinvent the category!Our use of the Caltech developed and NASA tested metal alloy (subsequently patented) — plus our patent-pending process of bonding this alloy to stainless steel — is what makes all this possible.You can have a kitchen knife that is ultra-sharp (CATRA proven) and lasts 5 times longer. This is what is truly different about our Habitat Kitchen Knives – and is what makes them better than Damascus steel knives or anything else you have owned or used. After all, getting something new and better is what crowdfunding is all about! Compare the proven metal hardness and sharpness of my Habitat Kitchen Knives – and their superior knife edge angle – to all other kitchen knives. You will see why I call these the new gold standard of kitchen knives.Look through the rewards to the right of this page and pick the one that’s right for you.

Founder, Dan Giusti, To Market Magazine 3. Our current free meal reimbursement rate of $3.31 (including labor and equipment expenses) per meal makes the entire endeavor nearly impossible for those without a culinary background. Q: HOW WILL BRIGAID ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES AND ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE?A: All over the country, school food service directors are doing everything they can to provide what is best for students. They are hardworking, well-intentioned people who are overburdened and plainly not getting the resources they need.This is where we come in. We focus on the kitchen and the overall dining experience by bringing in a professionally trained Chef whose entire career is focused on making sure the food is delicious while leading the kitchen and maintaining cost. Brigaid is dedicated to listening to and working with the staff who are already there and who know the schools, communities, and students better than anyone. We invest in their professional training, and forge a new kind of team that draws on the best parts of restaurants, schools, and more. Q: HOW WILL WE MAKE IT WORK FINANCIALLY?A: Brigaid’s model is to make our program financially self-sustaining for our food service departments.With more delicious food and greater variety come higher student participation rates. By increasing the number of students eating school meals, school districts receive more federal and state reimbursement dollars that go directly back to their food service programs.Second, we take advantage of school kitchen spaces that are too often neglected. Nationwide, these spaces are untouched after 1PM, all the while test kitchens are being built to try to satisfy the outside demand for kitchen space.

No matter how you are able to support, our family is beyond grateful! Here is our story:</p><p><br/><u><strong>How It Began:</strong></u><br/>Years ago, I began going to school for a formal French-Culinary training. With a couple of friends, I ventured through a season of learning. New sights, smells, and flavors invaded my senses! The passion for cooking and serving people grew rapidly. After finishing at Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts, I went on to work in some pretty great kitchens <i>(i.e. Universal Studios Orlando, BlueZoo at Disney's Swan &amp; Dolphin Hotel, The Country Club of Orlando, The Country Club of Ocala, etc.). </i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493769390/fqxxuritycem1msglt4r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>After 5 years of working as a full time chef, My wife and I decided to pursue full time ministry as Children's and Youth Pastors. Although our family has been serving in this capacity for about 5 years now, the passion for cooking and desire to own our own Food spot has never faded. <br/><br/>We recently relocated from Orlando, FL to Detroit, MI. After only a short time of living in the Motor City, we have already been inspired by the grit and hustle that this city is known for.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493769405/y8idzlcnu5kmofhkbxkm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Detroit is on the come up. This city is fighting it's way back and that ""rise from the dust"" spirit is in the air. So, with that, we believe it's time to get this thing moving!<br/><br/><u><strong>Goals &amp; Bigger Picture:</strong></u><br/>As I stated before, we currently work with kids and teenagers. Over the years, we have met countless teens who had an interest in cooking or working in a hospitality-type setting.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493769408/kuzwpputsqww2se41t84.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> Living in Detroit, we now have many students who need additional training, experience, positive environments, and mentorship. One of the goals for Comida Bueno would be to offer teens the chance to help run the food truck.

No matter how you are able to support, our family is beyond grateful! Here is our story:How It Began:Years ago, I began going to school for a formal French-Culinary training. With a couple of friends, I ventured through a season of learning. New sights, smells, and flavors invaded my senses! The passion for cooking and serving people grew rapidly. After finishing at Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts, I went on to work in some pretty great kitchens (i.e. Universal Studios Orlando, BlueZoo at Disney's Swan & Dolphin Hotel, The Country Club of Orlando, The Country Club of Ocala, etc.). After 5 years of working as a full time chef, My wife and I decided to pursue full time ministry as Children's and Youth Pastors. Although our family has been serving in this capacity for about 5 years now, the passion for cooking and desire to own our own Food spot has never faded. We recently relocated from Orlando, FL to Detroit, MI. After only a short time of living in the Motor City, we have already been inspired by the grit and hustle that this city is known for.Detroit is on the come up. This city is fighting it's way back and that ""rise from the dust"" spirit is in the air. So, with that, we believe it's time to get this thing moving!Goals & Bigger Picture:As I stated before, we currently work with kids and teenagers. Over the years, we have met countless teens who had an interest in cooking or working in a hospitality-type setting. Living in Detroit, we now have many students who need additional training, experience, positive environments, and mentorship. One of the goals for Comida Bueno would be to offer teens the chance to help run the food truck. Many will find a passion for cooking and food, others will just find a summer job.As a restaurant on wheels, our main goal is to create fun and refreshing food that encourages community and fellowship around a tasty meal.What's In A Name?If you know anything about Spanish, as a language, you know that ""comida bueno"" is grammatically incorrect. It should be ""buena"" in order to maintain proper tenses of the word. The spelling is purposely incorrect as a comedic  nod to my mixed upbringing.

<h3>What you need to know about my vision and my dream and how it will benefit you in the very, very near future!</h3>
<p>Ireland has come on leaps and bounds in recent times in terms of its vegan and dairy-free offerings, you just have to look to the likes of Sova Food, Veginity, Happy Food and even The Happy Pear (<u><strong>where I once served my time as a chef!</strong></u>), however, one thing that is sorely missing from this landscape is a great place to get a scoop of bloody brilliant dairy free, vegan ice cream.

<h3><strong><i>INTRODUCTION</i></strong></h3>
<p>Tarnished Hollow's story begins with a young entrepreneur who had never even considered drinking beer until one of his business projects was indelibly linked to the regional craft beer market in his home state of Indiana. Of course, we're talking about me...Branden, the founder of Tarnished Hollow Brewing. Ironic, isn't it?!  I was never raised around beer and while I was not a prude when it came to others' alcohol consumption, I simply never felt drawn toward it until my late 20s when my entrepreneurial aspirations pulled me into the world of craft beer. Like all things I undertake, I ensured myself that I would learn as much as I could in order to gain a better understanding of what I was sampling and how the beverage in front of me came to exist. And just like that, I fell in love NOT with how beer made me feel, but with the science and artistry behind making it...and I fell hard.</p>
<p>Since that moment, I have spent countless several years studying, researching, and finally brewing. Through personal enrichment, as well as my time operating <i>Digital District</i>, the craft beer and gaming taproom I co-own, I have gained an appreciation and obsession for the wide diversity that craft beer brings to a conversation and the economics of how craft beer changes a city or town's landscape. The time has come for me to put my passion to work by incorporating this love of brewing with my existing company to facilitate a sustainably sized commercial platform through which I can continue exploring beers and sharing them with the masses. Rather than kicking off at an entirely new location and enterprise, utilizing an unused segment of the current space to introduce small batch brewing on a 1/2 to 1 bbl system allows me to grow this operation in a minimal overhead situation while providing synergistic benefits between the craft beer taproom and my brewery. The current plan is rapid execution in order to begin commercial brewing operations before the conclusion of 2019 and expand operations into 2020.</p>
<h3><strong><i>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</i></strong></h3>
<p>Ideally for a small operation of this magnitude, we will need somewhere around $10,000 to completely execute the plan. Appropriate 240V electrical wiring, drainage, and lighting already exists in the space where the brewing system will be functioning. Our crowdfunding efforts are strictly for application fees at the state level, the posting of Brewer's Bonds at the federal/state level, and equipment purchases. Brewing systems in the 1/2 to 1 bbl range are priced anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 depending on clamp fittings, included hardware, etc. and fermenters--both 1/2 bbl and 1 bbl--are priced between $750 and $1200 based on additional parts.</p>
<p>We have prepared an array of perks to reward your contributions toward our crowdfunding efforts. For $150 and under tiers, backers will receive merchandise featuring the Tarnished Hollow brand. Additional perks above this level include more intrinsic and/or monetary benefits for those who wish to contribute in exchange for custom beers and future ""gains"" on beer via lifetime 4-packs and complimentary beers with every visit. If even ~60% of the perks are claimed, the FULL brewery plans can progress as soon as possible at <i>Digital District</i>. Our $2,000 goal was a reasonable expectation we felt, so as to not place the full $10K as our finishing line, and also one that would cover our application and bond fees if nothing else. Nevertheless, raising the full amount (or close to it) would be nothing short of amazing. </p>
<h3><strong><i>THE IMPACT</i></strong></h3>
<p>By helping Tarnished Hollow Brewing Co. become a fully realized operation inside of our existing business space, the impact begins immediately at Digital District by creating a brand new revenue stream with deeper discounts on our house beers, howler/growler fills, canned carry out and more. A regular bar is only as successful as the number of pints it pours, but with the addition of a brewery license, we actively carve a couple more unique paths toward additional profitability as a business. Beyond the immediate happenings at 4437 S Scatterfield Rd, a brewery of any kind on the south side of Anderson, IN, will provide casino-goers and New Castle, Pendleton, etc. residents another destination option for craft beer and entertainment without excess travel time while also providing 'local flavor' to an otherwise franchise-dominated part of the city.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong><i>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</i></strong></h3>
<p>Housing the nanobrewery within another facility mitigates a vast majority of risks and challenges, however, that does not mean none are present. The primary obstacle to overcome in order to launch brewing will be the federal licensing process. This is not necessarily due to TTB licensing and approval being an impossibly difficult process, but it is a lengthy and meticulous one that can take an average of 90+ days to complete once submitted. Be that as it may, this span of time between applying, inspections, and approval will provide a window of time that can be used to procure equipment, finish the brewery space's conversion, and fulfill crowdfunding item orders. </p>
<p>Another second-tier concern is the necessary funding amount should crowdfunding and investor opportunities fail to succeed. At this point, however, this concern is secondary due to the quantity of people interested in supporting and inquiring about this project. Opening on a shoestring budget is always an failsafe option as the taproom already exists and equipment can be pieced together to launch an initial barrage of beers to inject cashflow into the brewery.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong><i>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</i></strong></h3>
<p>Social media support and hype is integral to this expansion, both for Tarnished Hollow itself as a new undertaking, but also Digital District as a whole. Combining nanobrewing and a craft beer taproom with pinball and video/board games is not a novel concept, but it is one that presents unique opportunities for attracting new customers from a variety of demographics.</p>

For us, community means giving back, and in that spirit, we’ll be donating to Clackamas High School Arts programs (Drama, Band, Choir, Orchestra, and Fine Arts). Help us raise our goal of $3,500 to Clackamas High School Arts!</p><p>Valley Public House will be Happy Valley’s one stop shop for local drinks, food, and entertainment, complete with a whiskey bar, speakeasy, beer bar, and restaurant concepts from Portland favorites Ranch Pizza and Tamale Boy. Each restaurant will feature some of Happy Valley’s first and finest brunch options - bloody marys and mimosas included. Valley Public House will also feature: </p><ul>
<li>A photo booth</li>
<li>A destination where Happy Valley residents can gather to enjoy the Portland vibe of their favorite restaurants, beverages, and entertainment without the Portland traffic or crowds, under one roof</li>
<li>Food from Portland favorites Ranch Pizza and Tamale Boy</li>
<li>64 beer taps</li>
<li>Specialty cocktails</li>
<li>A fine dining restaurant and specialty whiskey bar called the Whiskey Barrel Lounge, to open in 2021. </li>
<li>A speakeasy to open in 2021</li>
</ul><p>But this can't happen without our community's support. We have been so lucky to build such a strong connection within our community and hope that Valley Public House can do all that, and more. Valley Growlers is a 21+ space, but Valley Public House will have space for families, as well as spaces designated for those 21+. With your help, we can make this a destination for delicious food, beer, and craft cocktails, with something for everyone. </p><p> </p><h3> </h3><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>With your help, we can build this space into Happy Valley's go-to destination for drinks, food, and entertainment, and support Clackamas High School’s arts programs. We need $30,000 to make this place as perfect as possible--no cutting corners--purchasing the things our construction loan doesn’t cover. Your donations will go to building out the speakeasy, creating a specialty cocktail program in the craft whiskey bar, and making this a great bar and restaurant for everyone.</p><p>Perks include:</p><ul>
<li>An invite to an exclusive, founders-only pick up preview party (including an exclusive tour!)</li>
<li>Your likeness painted in a mural inside the bar</li>
<li>Your photo hung prominently in the entrance</li>
<li>A dog bowl holder engraved with your dog’s name</li>

<li>And more!</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3> </h3><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Your contribution will help us make this dream a reality. Happy Valley is a wonderful community we’ve called home for 15 years. Our kids have grown up here, we’ve made friends here, and turned friendships into family. Valley Public House will be an extension of that community. </p><p>With your help, we will:</p><ul>
<li>Employ 26 to 30 People (That’s over 20 more than we already do at Valley Growlers)</li>
<li>Bring brunch to Happy Valley, complete with mimosas and bloody marys!</li>
<li>Create a community gathering space with live music, outdoor dining on the huge patio, fire pits, a few bars, and two restaurants, with more coming!</li>
<li>Build spaces for new retail to open</li>

</ul></div>","Valley Public House Coming September 2020! We’re Ami & Brian Shannon, of Happy Valley's Valley Growlers and we’re opening Valley Public House, a multi-bar, multi-restaurant space with something for everyone. For us, community means giving back, and in that spirit, we’ll be donating to Clackamas High School Arts programs (Drama, Band, Choir, Orchestra, and Fine Arts). Help us raise our goal of $3,500 to Clackamas High School Arts!Valley Public House will be Happy Valley’s one stop shop for local drinks, food, and entertainment, complete with a whiskey bar, speakeasy, beer bar, and restaurant concepts from Portland favorites Ranch Pizza and Tamale Boy. Each restaurant will feature some of Happy Valley’s first and finest brunch options - bloody marys and mimosas included. Valley Public House will also feature: 
A photo booth
A destination where Happy Valley residents can gather to enjoy the Portland vibe of their favorite restaurants, beverages, and entertainment without the Portland traffic or crowds, under one roof
Food from Portland favorites Ranch Pizza and Tamale Boy
64 beer taps
Specialty cocktails
A fine dining restaurant and specialty whiskey bar called the Whiskey Barrel Lounge, to open in 2021. 
A speakeasy to open in 2021
But this can't happen without our community's support. We have been so lucky to build such a strong connection within our community and hope that Valley Public House can do all that, and more. Valley Growlers is a 21+ space, but Valley Public House will have space for families, as well as spaces designated for those 21+. With your help, we can make this a destination for delicious food, beer, and craft cocktails, with something for everyone.   What We Need & What You GetWith your help, we can build this space into Happy Valley's go-to destination for drinks, food, and entertainment, and support Clackamas High School’s arts programs. We need $30,000 to make this place as perfect as possible--no cutting corners--purchasing the things our construction loan doesn’t cover. Your donations will go to building out the speakeasy, creating a specialty cocktail program in the craft whiskey bar, and making this a great bar and restaurant for everyone.Perks include:
An invite to an exclusive, founders-only pick up preview party (including an exclusive tour!)
Your likeness painted in a mural inside the bar
Your photo hung prominently in the entrance
A dog bowl holder engraved with your dog’s name
T-shirts and mugs, available exclusively to founders
The ability to be in promotional videos
Private parties on the mezzanine
Antique Fire Truck Tap Parties
A brew day with Valley Public House and Bend's SunRiver Brewing
Tap handle for a year--you choose the beer that goes on the tap for an entire year!
And more!
  The ImpactYour contribution will help us make this dream a reality. Happy Valley is a wonderful community we’ve called home for 15 years. Our kids have grown up here, we’ve made friends here, and turned friendships into family. Valley Public House will be an extension of that community. With your help, we will:
Employ 26 to 30 People (That’s over 20 more than we already do at Valley Growlers)
Bring brunch to Happy Valley, complete with mimosas and bloody marys!
Create a community gathering space with live music, outdoor dining on the huge patio, fire pits, a few bars, and two restaurants, with more coming!
Build spaces for new retail to open

<h3>Let's Get Acquainted</h3>
<p>Who knew such great food could come from a 10x10 tent but damn is it hard work without a kitchen of our own. After 3 years of pop ups and a championship poutine belt later the time has come to grow.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>A passion for great food and drink is what we thrive on. The Northeast Kingdom is ready for some flavor and we couldn't agree more. Our unique concept would add some much needed vibrancy to the local food scene and beyond with a menu solely focused on the French Canadian classic of hand cut fries, cheddar curds and a rich, scratch gravy. We fell hard for the versatility of the dish. You can put almost anything on it and don't worry, we intend to! With things like creative vegetarian options, vegan options and a kick ass Sunday brunch we'll be adding things the area is in desperate need of. Once the restaurant is established, we will get the food truck on the road and to a town near you. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>2016 Test Poutine</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nothing has made Ryan happier in life than music and food. Since the age of 16, Ryan has worked in all types of restaurants from pizza shops to fine dining. He graduated in 2002 with a Le Cordon Bleu culinary degree and never looked back...until the drums took over. After years of touring in bands led Ryan to the Great White North, the home of the national treasure that is poutine, he had an idea one late winter night in Ottawa. With a little research it was discovered that no one was solely focused on making poutine in New England. So it was decided that a food truck would fill that void. The initial goal was to buy a truck, find an investor, outfit it with a kitchen and fry those fries, baby. Seemed easy enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560743580/aw41aejkui10isj2ighg.png"" src=""""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hurdle after hurdle led us down the path that we are on right now, the tent. Unfortunately the investor didn't work out so we worked our butts off, got a van, a 40lb fryer and started the coolest pop up business east of the Mississippi. To our utter shock and surprise, people started lining up at the brewery (sometimes for over an hour) to have a taste of what we were peddling. Sell outs became the norm but our niche business CAN'T continue or grow without a space to call our own. Ryan told an old boss one time that he would NEVER own his own spot but here we are. Life on the road has slowed down and he's dying to cook again. Especially for you. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>This venture wouldn't be possible without the undying love and support from Ryan's life co-pilot, Shannon. She is the sugar to his salt and the face of VDOP that everyone has come to know and love. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560741751/fcna5escvzzmgrrckjvu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her 12+ years working in customer service has provided us the ultimate business duo. She washes a mean dish and can fry a fry with the best of them. Shannon has a printing/graphic art background that has always provided VDOP with the skills Ryan lacks. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Here's Why We Need You</h3>
<p>We've recently moved the business from the hustle and bustle of its original home in Lowell, MA to the Great North Woods of beautiful New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Some terrible news came our way recently in the form of the state of NH not being able to permit our mobile tent set up due to fact that it is not an ""enclosed mobile food unit"". We have had to cancel a handful of events including our triumphant return to NH Poutinefest 2019. Our only option now is to find a kitchen AND we think we did! The stars have aligned and the most economical space has become available just over the border from our new home in Colebrook, NH. We have put in the long days of standing over the fryer and have personally exhausted our own finances.  VDOP really needs a hand with keeping this ball rolling.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>VDOP has found a restaurant space that is already outfitted with the full kitchen they need to provide you with the food you have come to know and love. You think its hard trying to get an apartment? You should try leasing a restaurant space. That first, last and security really adds up! We need your help to make the deposits on this space so we can get it going ASAP.</p>
<p>Can't run a business without permits and we sure do need a mountain of them. From a general board of health permit to a beer/wine license so we can keep those mimosas flying on Sunday. Oh, and we want to stay mobile but Vermont requires a permit for that too! </p>
<p>With changing from a mobile unit to a restaurant, our liability insurance will need to be updated to suit our new needs.</p>
<p>As of right now VDOP is run as a sole proprietorship and that needs to change. Becoming an LLC will give us the personal protection needed in the event that something goes wrong and the courts decide they want to take our cats. We'd love to keep 'em.</p>
<p>It's going to take a lot of spuds to get us off the ground! The most important piece to the puzzle is all those ingredients needed to produce our award winning poutine and you can't make great food without great product. We want to take advantage of the vast network of small farms in the area by building relationships with the abundant amount of producers the NEK has to offer. These relationships will be beneficial to the community and critical to our mission. A local economy is a healthy economy.  </p>
<p><strong>Your generous donations will go towards:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The lease deposits - $3,900</strong></p>
<p><strong>Those pesky permits - $660</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update and renew our insurance - $800</strong></p>
<p><strong>Become an LLC - $150</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inventory and supply purchase - $5,000</strong></p>
<p><b>Small Wares - $1,000</b></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Who doesn't love some crucial merch? Not only will you get to finally sit down with a poutine in our long awaited space but you'll get to rep some neat VDOP goods everywhere you go. Shirts, stickers and koozies could all be yours for a donation to our campaign. For all the real poutiniacs out there consider getting your hands on a membership to VDOP's exclusive Fork Club.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Backup Plan</h3>
<p>The restaurant business is one of the hardest industries to get started in but we already have one foot in the door after starting our mobile poutinerie and we need you to give us that last push. We are ready to overcome any and all obstacles that stand in the way of our poutine dreams. Even if the goal is not met, we will never stop doing what we love, cooking for you. See you in the tent but hopefully in our Island Pond space first.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Don't forget! Even if you can't donate, sharing this campaign with your family and friends will be equally as helpful and very much appreciated. Find us on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>We started making pierogi on Sundays in winter 2016. We went to a few farmers markets a month on Saturdays. Our first market, we went with 45 boxes and sold out in an hour. And we thought... I guess this could be a thing.</p>
<p>After a year of making pierogi on nights and weekends, we left our jobs last January and took pierogi full-time. It's been a grind, but by the summer, we felt like we were gaining serious momentum. We did 17 farmers markets, a few events a week, and started selling to stores. By the start of November, we were in 40 stores, and we know the potential is endless! We recently expanded our distribution into New Hampshire and Rhode Island, and aim to be throughout New England by the spring. What's next after that? Well, we'll just keep going.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are seeking $25,000 through Indiegogo, but will likely need closer to $100K for our buildout, which we will pursue through other loans. </li>
<li>In exchange for your help, you get pierogi love in all kinds of forms!</li>
<li>We will use money raised towards: Purchase and installation of hood &amp; Ansul system, walk-in freezer, blast chiller, updated packaging, plumbing &amp; sinks, flooring, ceilings, and all the other costs that will certainly pop up as we build this place out!</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>See donation options and perks for details. But expect free boxes, hot pierogi, beers, catering, classes, and lots of high fives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Thank You!</h3>
<p>We are constantly overwhelmed by the pierogi love and encouragement we receive daily from our followers. You are our motivation to work late, wake up early, pinch pinch pinch, and take these leaps (like building out this huge space!). We hope to be your pierogi purveyors long into the future, bringing a high-quality product to all corners of New England - and hopefully beyond!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Tell everyone you know. Come eat pierogi. Rep our business. Give us high fives and hugs.</p>

In exchange for your help, you get pierogi love in all kinds of forms!
We will use money raised towards: Purchase and installation of hood & Ansul system, walk-in freezer, blast chiller, updated packaging, plumbing & sinks, flooring, ceilings, and all the other costs that will certainly pop up as we build this place out!

What You Get
See donation options and perks for details. But expect free boxes, hot pierogi, beers, catering, classes, and lots of high fives.

Thank You!
We are constantly overwhelmed by the pierogi love and encouragement we receive daily from our followers. You are our motivation to work late, wake up early, pinch pinch pinch, and take these leaps (like building out this huge space!). We hope to be your pierogi purveyors long into the future, bringing a high-quality product to all corners of New England - and hopefully beyond!

Other Ways You Can Help
Tell everyone you know. Come eat pierogi. Rep our business. Give us high fives and hugs.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, Micah and Heidi here, founders of Orleans Foods, Ltd. Co. We are Louisiana natives with a passion for food and culture. We begin our food journey with the opening of our restaurant Orleans Brews and Beignets Coffeehouse and Cafe in April 2017. We experienced great success and sold tons of beignets and other Creole food specialties to thousands of customers while in business to rave reviews! We were on our way and opened our second location in 2019 to lines out the door (this location has now been sold to another owner). We were at an all time high with plans for more growth and expansion.</p>
<p>As 2020 began to unfold, more trouble and bad news in the world seemed to be the trajectory of  the year. We knew we had to keep making people smile through food. This was and is our passion. Our restaurants had been known by our hashtag as #TheHappyPlace and we knew this was the path we needed to take. </p>
<p>So....here we are launching the first of our planned food products. We have already started production and fulfilling some wholesale orders but we need more word of mouth and especially our past customers to help us spread the word that we are back in business, just in a different form. </p>
<p>Now you can have our signature award winning beignets anytime in the comfort of your home.  We believe you and your family will enjoy getting a little messy for these delectable treats!</p>
