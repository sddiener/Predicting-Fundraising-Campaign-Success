<h2><strong>Who We Are &amp; What We Want to Do</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526079484/hyshrx1tdq6wuktckonl.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>We're an independent student production shooting ""Recon"", a character-driven, dramedy web series about a group of queer college freshmen and their attempts to balance their personal lives and relationships-- <strong>while training to be spies. </strong>Our team is filled with interesting, diverse, and exciting voices coming primarily from the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts.</p>
<p>From figuring out social etiquette, navigating the diplomacy of her new deadly roommate, and Netflix and (actual) chill to taking down a huge government conspiracy, the show explores the lives of five queer spies in training as they begin to truly figure out who they are in their big scary world.</p>
<p>Wait-- huge government conspiracy? Set at the ancient and mysterious Academy, the show follows Ava, a skilled hacker from the Midwest who’s finally able to come out and make friends at her new school. While she’s able to make friends quickly, everything falls apart when she finds out that her entire life is being recorded and posted online in neatly edited, five- to ten-minute episodes, and her friends believe she's been making them. With a bit of <i>Community</i>, a bit of James Bond, and a lot of queer characters, ""Recon"" is a unique and exciting show with positive vibes. </p>
<p><br/><strong>Our goal is to provide quality content about diverse characters who also happen to be queer.</strong> The sad truth is, there is still not nearly enough queer content out there in the entertainment world, but what little there is has had profound effects on queer youth, allowing them to identify with characters and feel represented. The mission of ""Recon"" is to give queer people their James Bond experience, featuring characters from from various racial, ethnic, and class backgrounds. To learn more about our characters, check out our character descriptions at the bottom of the campaign!</p>

<p>Ana (she/her) is thrilled to be playing the role of Ava in RECON. Growing up in the small artsy town of Ojai, California, with her screenwriting parents, a rescued Australian shepherd named Jazz, and her grandparents, she developed her appreciation and love for the environment, animals and the arts. She’s a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, where she studied Dance and Filmmaking. When Ana’s not acting, you'll find her gracefully dancing on silks or teaching kids and teens the joys of aerial dance, or in a studio studying acting, kickboxing, dance or yoga. She’s an avid hiker, reader, cook and gym rat, and loves spending time with family and friends.</p>

Raised in a household of performers, she spent many nights around dressing rooms and backstage theaters in Puerto Rico. At age 11, she began fencing, and from being just a hobby, it quickly became a professional career. She had the honor of representing Puerto Rico around the world, including the Pan-American Games in Rio ’07. After graduating High School in Puerto Rico, she took a leap of faith, hung up her mask and sword, and moved to Los Angeles to begin her studies at The American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Promptly after graduating she came out to the world! Since then, she’s had the pleasure representing Latinx Queers and working on several groundbreaking LGBTQ projects, including the Award Winning short “Vámonos,” Amazon’s “Transparent,” Freeform’s “The Fosters,” MACRO’s “Gente-fied,” and Rachael Cantu’s “You’re The Most”. She’s currently working on her close up magic skills for the upcoming short “Muscle Memory” directed by award winning director Carly Usdin.

Having accomplished much as a stage actor in past years in Santa Barbara, Joré is currently focused on making her transition into film and television smooth and successful, as well as developing her own projects in order to create opportunities for collaboration with other artists. She is on the constant search for stories that uplift, challenge, and comment on the world of today in a necessary manner, and is thrilled to be a part of RECON, as it does exactly that!</p>

<h2>Characters </h2>
<p><strong>AVA</strong> is from a small, rural town in the midwest. Which was...a nightmare. Ava’s so happy to finally be out on her own, though nothing could prepare her for navigating life at the Academy. Between learning how to embrace her queerness and how to make friends, this anxious, unassuming, and sensitive girl is about to have the ride of her life. A goofy girl at heart, Ava drowns herself in her work to avoid inner turmoil and insecurities, but is prone to losing her logic when her emotions become too much to handle and cloud her vision. A child prodigy in computing, it was Ava’s hacking abilities that put her on the Academy’s watch-list, and eventually led to her recruitment.</p>
<p>Outside of her ingrained dedication to academics, she’s driven by empathy and a powerful sense of right and wrong, but finds her sense of self and morality are immature and untested. Despite this, she tries her best to succeed, take care of her friends, and do no wrong.</p>
<p>Over the course of the series, Ava develops romantic feelings for Ren, and melds her friend group together by complete accident. Everything seems to be going great, but when she discovers her entire life is being filmed and posted online, and her friends are torn away from her, Ava must come face to face with her childhood fear of rejection.</p> <p><strong>REN</strong> is another new recruit at the Academy, specializing in the field agent track. Ren was raised born in Chicago to accepting teaching parents who never questioned their child’s queerness, helping Ren establish themselves every step of the way. Ren never really “came out”-- it was just an accepted state of being for them and their family... Ren liked hot people and hot people liked Ren. And they didn't have a gender.</p>
<p>Casual and confidently queer, Ren is relaxed and nonchalant about almost everything.  Ren acts as a happy, casual foil to an anxious Ava, who they befriend during orientation at the Academy. However, despite their self-assuredness, their emotional maturity has some blind spots, including a complete inability to realize that their best friend Ava is developing feelings for them...or that they’re developing them back.</p>
<p>Although they’re training to be a field agent, their empathetic side comes out as they realize the implications of their violent training and the amoral things the spy world has to offer. Things Ren may be forced to do. While their moral crisis plays out, so does the revelation that Ava’s life is being broadcasted online, throwing their life—and relationship with Ava—into chaos.</p> <p><strong>RILEY</strong> is the human embodiment of a bubble. She’s incredibly friendly and determined, loyal to her friends until the very end. Though, Riley’s path to the Academy was one ripe with tragedy. Riley is a legacy who didn’t know it: born to two spies, her parents kept her in the dark about their true profession in order to give her a normal childhood. This plan was ruined, however, when both died in the field, leaving 12-year-old Riley to be taken in by two other spies—Taylor’s parents.</p>
<p>Although Riley managed to maintain her chipper attitude and energetic personality, her parents’ secret life and subsequent death left her with serious scars and heavy-duty trust issues. Still, she developed a strong bond with the slightly older Taylor, who helped her adjust to her new reality and quickly became a confident and protector… and then something more.</p>
<p>Now training to go into the world of espionage—but not a field agent—Riley is overly enthusiastic and incredibly ready to take on her freshman year. A polyglot prodigy, Riley is invasive in several languages, using her interpersonal skills to cause others to reveal-all. First on her agenda is to make new friends, which includes Ava, who she targets for friendship as soon as she lays eyes on her.</p>
<p>While their friendship is fast (due to Riley’s slightly invasive but well-meaning “bonding” questions), their fallout is faster. When she sees herself online as part of “Ava’s” show, she becomes furious at Ava’s supposed betrayal, which forces Ava to learn how to mend a friendship.</p> <p><strong>TAYLOR</strong>, a sophomore already accustomed to the espionage game of the Academy is quieter and much more composed than her partner-in-crime Riley. Taylor is a straight-laced and high-achieving legacy who serves as a protector, and for some, eventually more than that. She’s introspective and a bit anxious, but much more in control of her emotions and identity. Serving as an orientation advisor, journalist for the school newspaper, and an active member of several clubs while pursuing her forensics degree (with honors), Taylor is easily at the top of the sophomore class. And everyone knows it. Her wit is deadly, as is her attention to detail.</p>
<p>Riley, however, is Taylor’s one point of weakness: protective to a fault and easily jealous when it comes to the object of her affections, she struggles to overcome her jealousy over Riley’s intense interest in and growing bond with Ava. When Riley splits from Ava, so does Taylor.</p>
<p>Taylor’s parents are similarly involved in the school, as minor donors and active alumni, they participate frequently in activities for both alumni and parents. Thus, the pressure is on for Taylor to be at the top of her game, but sometimes that means she has to take some time out to play games.</p> <p><strong>JONES</strong> is fighter who could kill you with the sharpness of her eyeliner. Or her eyeliner pencil, whichever is more convenient for her. Jones is a badass legacy student training to be a field agent, although she may be harder to best in a fight—or in an interrogation room—than most professionals.</p>
<p>Jones is anything but an ordinary legacy. She descends from a legendary line of high-powered, highly dangerous spies and governmental officials who disowned her mother after she married Jones’s father. Happiness was short-lived for the Jones family as during her childhood, Jones’ father was murdered her mother’s side of the family. She honors his legacy by going by his surname.</p>
<p>Raised on the road as her mother fled from her dangerous and dysfunctional family, Jones learned how to speak multiple languages and to always be on her guard. Finally at the Academy her treacherous, wealthy grandparents help run, she’s defensive, guarded, and here to do nothing but succeed and surpass her everyone’s expectations. But Jones hits a bit of a bump in the road when it comes to making friends. While she initially rejects any attempts at Ava’s or her friends’ attempts to befriend her in favor of silence and polishing knives, she eventually bonds with Ava when the revelation of the recordings comes out—and nothing is ever the same again.</p>

We're an independent student production shooting ""Recon"", a character-driven, dramedy web series about a group of queer college freshmen and their attempts to balance their personal lives and relationships-- while training to be spies. Our team is filled with interesting, diverse, and exciting voices coming primarily from the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts.
From figuring out social etiquette, navigating the diplomacy of her new deadly roommate, and Netflix and (actual) chill to taking down a huge government conspiracy, the show explores the lives of five queer spies in training as they begin to truly figure out who they are in their big scary world.
Wait-- huge government conspiracy? Set at the ancient and mysterious Academy, the show follows Ava, a skilled hacker from the Midwest who’s finally able to come out and make friends at her new school. While she’s able to make friends quickly, everything falls apart when she finds out that her entire life is being recorded and posted online in neatly edited, five- to ten-minute episodes, and her friends believe she's been making them. With a bit of Community, a bit of James Bond, and a lot of queer characters, ""Recon"" is a unique and exciting show with positive vibes. 
Our goal is to provide quality content about diverse characters who also happen to be queer. The sad truth is, there is still not nearly enough queer content out there in the entertainment world, but what little there is has had profound effects on queer youth, allowing them to identify with characters and feel represented. The mission of ""Recon"" is to give queer people their James Bond experience, featuring characters from from various racial, ethnic, and class backgrounds. To learn more about our characters, check out our character descriptions at the bottom of the campaign!

Where Your Money Will Go
We are shooting a 21 episode first season! To cover our production costs for top-notch production design and to support our incredibly dedicated and hardworking cast and crew, we need your help! Our budget is as follows:

Everything we receive on this page will go towards building “RECON” and the world of the Academy.
What you get in return besides our undying gratitude and a literal kick-ass series are some awesome perks ranging from behind-the-scenes Snapchat access to custom Recon stickers to a custom cocktail recipe book filled with drinks inspired by each of the characters.
Thank you so much for helping ""RECON"" be the best show it can be and providing some much needed queer, diverse content for the entertainment world!

Having accomplished much as a stage actor in past years in Santa Barbara, Joré is currently focused on making her transition into film and television smooth and successful, as well as developing her own projects in order to create opportunities for collaboration with other artists.

Characters 
AVA is from a small, rural town in the midwest. Which was...a nightmare. Ava’s so happy to finally be out on her own, though nothing could prepare her for navigating life at the Academy. Between learning how to embrace her queerness and how to make friends, this anxious, unassuming, and sensitive girl is about to have the ride of her life. A goofy girl at heart, Ava drowns herself in her work to avoid inner turmoil and insecurities, but is prone to losing her logic when her emotions become too much to handle and cloud her vision. A child prodigy in computing, it was Ava’s hacking abilities that put her on the Academy’s watch-list, and eventually led to her recruitment.
Outside of her ingrained dedication to academics, she’s driven by empathy and a powerful sense of right and wrong, but finds her sense of self and morality are immature and untested. Despite this, she tries her best to succeed, take care of her friends, and do no wrong.
Over the course of the series, Ava develops romantic feelings for Ren, and melds her friend group together by complete accident. Everything seems to be going great, but when she discovers her entire life is being filmed and posted online, and her friends are torn away from her, Ava must come face to face with her childhood fear of rejection. REN is another new recruit at the Academy, specializing in the field agent track. Ren was raised born in Chicago to accepting teaching parents who never questioned their child’s queerness, helping Ren establish themselves every step of the way. Ren never really “came out”-- it was just an accepted state of being for them and their family... Ren liked hot people and hot people liked Ren. And they didn't have a gender.
Casual and confidently queer, Ren is relaxed and nonchalant about almost everything.  Ren acts as a happy, casual foil to an anxious Ava, who they befriend during orientation at the Academy. However, despite their self-assuredness, their emotional maturity has some blind spots, including a complete inability to realize that their best friend Ava is developing feelings for them...or that they’re developing them back.
Although they’re training to be a field agent, their empathetic side comes out as they realize the implications of their violent training and the amoral things the spy world has to offer. Things Ren may be forced to do. While their moral crisis plays out, so does the revelation that Ava’s life is being broadcasted online, throwing their life—and relationship with Ava—into chaos. RILEY is the human embodiment of a bubble. She’s incredibly friendly and determined, loyal to her friends until the very end. Though, Riley’s path to the Academy was one ripe with tragedy. Riley is a legacy who didn’t know it: born to two spies, her parents kept her in the dark about their true profession in order to give her a normal childhood. This plan was ruined, however, when both died in the field, leaving 12-year-old Riley to be taken in by two other spies—Taylor’s parents.
Although Riley managed to maintain her chipper attitude and energetic personality, her parents’ secret life and subsequent death left her with serious scars and heavy-duty trust issues. Still, she developed a strong bond with the slightly older Taylor, who helped her adjust to her new reality and quickly became a confident and protector… and then something more.
Now training to go into the world of espionage—but not a field agent—Riley is overly enthusiastic and incredibly ready to take on her freshman year. A polyglot prodigy, Riley is invasive in several languages, using her interpersonal skills to cause others to reveal-all. First on her agenda is to make new friends, which includes Ava, who she targets for friendship as soon as she lays eyes on her.
While their friendship is fast (due to Riley’s slightly invasive but well-meaning “bonding” questions), their fallout is faster. When she sees herself online as part of “Ava’s” show, she becomes furious at Ava’s supposed betrayal, which forces Ava to learn how to mend a friendship. TAYLOR, a sophomore already accustomed to the espionage game of the Academy is quieter and much more composed than her partner-in-crime Riley. Taylor is a straight-laced and high-achieving legacy who serves as a protector, and for some, eventually more than that. She’s introspective and a bit anxious, but much more in control of her emotions and identity. Serving as an orientation advisor, journalist for the school newspaper, and an active member of several clubs while pursuing her forensics degree (with honors), Taylor is easily at the top of the sophomore class. And everyone knows it. Her wit is deadly, as is her attention to detail.
Riley, however, is Taylor’s one point of weakness: protective to a fault and easily jealous when it comes to the object of her affections, she struggles to overcome her jealousy over Riley’s intense interest in and growing bond with Ava. When Riley splits from Ava, so does Taylor.
Taylor’s parents are similarly involved in the school, as minor donors and active alumni, they participate frequently in activities for both alumni and parents. Thus, the pressure is on for Taylor to be at the top of her game, but sometimes that means she has to take some time out to play games. JONES is fighter who could kill you with the sharpness of her eyeliner. Or her eyeliner pencil, whichever is more convenient for her. Jones is a badass legacy student training to be a field agent, although she may be harder to best in a fight—or in an interrogation room—than most professionals.
Jones is anything but an ordinary legacy. She descends from a legendary line of high-powered, highly dangerous spies and governmental officials who disowned her mother after she married Jones’s father. Happiness was short-lived for the Jones family as during her childhood, Jones’ father was murdered her mother’s side of the family. She honors his legacy by going by his surname.
Raised on the road as her mother fled from her dangerous and dysfunctional family, Jones learned how to speak multiple languages and to always be on her guard. Finally at the Academy her treacherous, wealthy grandparents help run, she’s defensive, guarded, and here to do nothing but succeed and surpass her everyone’s expectations. But Jones hits a bit of a bump in the road when it comes to making friends. While she initially rejects any attempts at Ava’s or her friends’ attempts to befriend her in favor of silence and polishing knives, she eventually bonds with Ava when the revelation of the recordings comes out—and nothing is ever the same again.

<h3>Hello there! Thanks for visiting our Indiegogo page!</h3>
<p>We are a small like-minded group of professional independent filmmakers from the Twin Cities area who are gladly taking time away from our 10,000 lakes this summer to film 6 episodes of an original comedy webseries, <i>FEM 101.</i> </p>
<p><u><i><strong>Please check out our gallery above for pics of the team and the actors!</strong></i></u></p>
<h2><i><strong>IN THE BEGINNING...</strong></i></h2>
<h3><i>We had a funny idea, and wanted to make a show.</i></h3>
<p>We asked, what would happen if we throw 8 random characters (who just happen to be mostly men) in an urban community class setting in front of a small town white feminist teacher hell bent on doing away with patriarchy once and for all and teaching everyone what it really means to be a feminist.</p>
<p><i>FEM 101</i>  was born.</p>
<p>Next, 5 Writers came up with 5 characters each. We whittled down the 25 potential omelette ingredients to the best 8 characters <u><strong>(See gallery pics above for actor and character info!)</strong></u></p>
<p>The idea stuck in our heads more and more, and we soon completely dedicated ourselves to creating a 6 episode webseries to explore this theme and this story fully, with a high production value, so you will have the ultimate entertainment experience.</p>
<p>This June 16/17 and June 30/July 1, we are going to film 6  5-10 minute episodes in 4 days. How? By filming it like a comedy TV show, with multiple cameras, in one location:</p>

<p>The FEM 101 Classroom</p>
<h3>BUT - An acronym for Behold the Underlying Truth</h3>
<p>There's no doubt about it. We are trying to make a smart comedy webseries about feminism and everything that surrounds this word today. #Metoo, Intersectional Feminism, Sexism, Race and Racism, Class Struggle, the <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/today-isnt-equal-pay-day-for-black-latina-or-native-american-women.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wage gap</a>, reproductive rights, gendered poverty and violence, - is all ongoing.

They are discriminated against, institutionally and directly, in politics, in employment, in the arts, in media and in culture.""</i></p>
<p>So the themes are there; the stakes, it's safe to say, are pretty high.</p>
<p>AND, as we moviemakers know too well, the film industry we work in has been wracked by the evils of sexism and racism and abuse, as the #metoo movement shows, and as the <a href=""https://annenberg.usc.edu/sites/default/files/Dr_Stacy_L_Smith-Inequality_in_900_Popular_Films.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stats</a> regarding the chronic under and misrepresentation of girls and women on Film and TV show. SO you can say it's a little personal too.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p>
<p>This is the truth about why we are making this show. Because women's stories and voices being heard affects us all and is bloody important. This is why, through this project, we aim to shed some honest light on this complex topic and how it affects EVERYONE across the entire race, class, sex and gender spectrum of American society today.</p>
<p>We are not the only artists sensing a shift and a pull to play in this feminist space.</p>

I'm a native New Yorker with Venezuelan background and also currently a senior at Marymount Manhattan College in the Upper East Side of NYC.

The only thing that was wrong with that was that it ruined the way I saw myself because of how the portrayal of Latin actors were making us seem, things like being low class, becoming a maid, drug addict/dealer, and uneducated (being a kid, I didn't know the difference) I went as far as avoiding the sun to not get tanner and even stopped myself from speaking Spanish at home.

This project is going to be one of the biggest projects I've ever worked on which is why I'm reaching out to YOU, the contributors and seeking funding to change the perspective of how we're viewed in modern American TV now.

<p>Despite what you may think, The BALLS team are only mere mortals. They could never accomplish their ambitious vision by themselves, and received mentorship from several successful writers and producers in the Canadian Comedy industry. Firstly, Canadian Comedy producer, director and editor Allan Novak,  who helped the group organize and create the entire pre-production bible to guide the production process. Alongside Allan, the boys met up with Canadian comedic legends Dan Redican, Tim Burns and Paul Chato. These three wise men helped the writers of Balls improve upon their existing scripts, and offered wisdom and insight on the industry.</p>

<p>The most significant risk to any production is the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To protect the health and well-being of all cast and crew members, we have updated our safety plan to require  Safe Sets COVID-19 Certification to minimize any risk of COVID transmission. Furthermore, we will provide hand sanitizer at shoots, require masks (with the exception of actors on camera), and have reworked scripts and call sheets in order to reduce the number of people on set and facilitate social distancing.</p>
<p>The other (less topical) challenge we face is funding. Aside from a literal apocalypse (which wouldn’t surprise any of us at this point), nothing will stop us from creating BALLS. If worse comes to worst and we don’t meet our funding goal, we’ll just revise the financial plan, stop feeding our PAs, and try again. We believe in this project, and if we only have room in the budget to film in an abandoned forest on a flip phone, then we’ll make the best found-footage sketch comedy show the world has ever seen (but also please help us to not do that).</p>

To protect the health and well-being of all cast and crew members, we have updated our safety plan to require  Safe Sets COVID-19 Certification to minimize any risk of COVID transmission. Furthermore, we will provide hand sanitizer at shoots, require masks (with the exception of actors on camera), and have reworked scripts and call sheets in order to reduce the number of people on set and facilitate social distancing.
The other (less topical) challenge we face is funding. Aside from a literal apocalypse (which wouldn’t surprise any of us at this point), nothing will stop us from creating BALLS. If worse comes to worst and we don’t meet our funding goal, we’ll just revise the financial plan, stop feeding our PAs, and try again. We believe in this project, and if we only have room in the budget to film in an abandoned forest on a flip phone, then we’ll make the best found-footage sketch comedy show the world has ever seen (but also please help us to not do that).",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>SET YOUR OWN DONATION AND BACK THE SERIES WITH ANY AMOUNT YOU CAN! <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scary-sleepover-the-resurrection#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PART 1</a> OF THIS CAMPAIGN SAW TWO NEW EPISODES FUNDED AND SHOT! A THIRD NEW EPISODE REACHED FUNDING ON 8/16! EVERY $5,000 RAISED = A NEW EPISODE! PLEASE READ BELOW AND HELP KEEP THE SLUMBER PARTIES COMING!</strong></p>
<p><u>UPDATED - JULY 1, 2020</u>: Remember when we thought we were going to be able to just keep accepting donations on the original campaign page after the initial 60-day campaign period had ended? Well... although the original campaign page was indeed still accepting donations in the form of reward purchases  (YAY!)... unfortunately the original campaign page would no longer allow backers to set their own donation amount  (BOO!)... so here we are with PART 2 - the next (and final) part of the campaign to resurrect SCARY SLEEPOVER!  Same campaign, same rewards, same great show!  </p>
<p>We know that reading a ton of text can be tedious for some, but everything you could possibly need to know about this campaign is explained in detail below and Adam Green is very good about personally posting consistent and thorough updates in the ""Updates"" section of this campaign. Please note that since IndieGoGo's ""Rewards"" section (located to the right) has a very strict limit on the amount of text creators can use to describe each reward, we've <u>thoroughly</u> explained the rewards further down in this campaign overview. Please read the full description of each reward before purchasing one. Remember, <strong>you can always set your own donation amount </strong>and every dollar helps our effort to produce SCARY SLEEPOVER! Rewards are merely incentives for more generous donations. <strong>You do not need to purchase one of the rewards to help back the series!</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps you've been following the resurrection of SCARY SLEEPOVER since Part 1 of this campaign launched in January. Perhaps you've already contributed once or twice and helped get the first THREE episodes of Season 3 produced. If you already know all of the details about the campaign and just have questions about how the money we had already raised is going roll over to Part 2 of our crowd fund effort- feel free to scroll down to the very bottom of this campaign description.</p>
<p>Perhaps you didn't know about the resurrection of SCARY SLEEPOVER until you watched one of the new episodes that this campaign has funded so far. Episode 3.1 ""Doug Benson"" premieres for the general public on ArieScope.com and on ArieScope's YouTube channel on July 4th while Episode 3.2 ""Brian Quinn"" will premiere on August 22nd! If so - WELCOME! We've been waiting for you! Between the above video and the information below you'll find everything you need to know about the resurrection of SCARY SLEEPOVER. This campaign was off to a solid start with two new episodes reaching funding before the COVID-19 pandemic arrived and totally wet the bed on our slumber party fun.  We temporarily paused our crowd funding efforts in March as the United States went into lockdown- but now that the country is starting to open up again it's time for the show to go on and for our resurrection efforts to continue!  We only have 60 days to get the rest of Season 3 green-lit. However many episodes reach funding in this second (and final) part of our campaign - that's our third season. Hopefully we get to make a full season for you! </p>
<h3><u><strong>WHAT IS SCARY SLEEPOVER?</strong></u></h3>
<p>Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER is an on-line reality series that features some of the biggest names in genre entertainment like you've never seen them before... in their pajamas! In each episode a different celebrity artist joins filmmaker Adam Green (HATCHET, FROZEN) for a slumber party at his studio where they spend the night playing games, watching movies, eating junk food, and having extremely candid conversations that reveal their biggest real life fears. The 29 existing episodes that made up Seasons 1 and 2 have been watched over 1 million times between ArieScope.com and ArieScope's YouTube channel!<br/><br/>It was Green's goal in creating SCARY SLEEPOVER to not only entertain audiences but to make a real connection between artists and fans. While the show may be inherently funny and contain a lot of truly hilarious moments, it is also bursting with genuine heart. Since every guest already has a personal relationship with Green they are comfortable opening up about themselves in an extremely honest and candid manner that you just don't find anywhere else. Through its many emotional and revealing moments SCARY SLEEPOVER has given fans a much deeper look at who these artists really are and just how much we all truly have in common as a community. </p>
<h3><u><strong>THE GUESTS SO FAR:</strong></u></h3>
<p>Previous guests have include: Slash (GUNS N ROSES), Sid Haig (THE DEVIL'S REJECTS), Kane Hodder (FRIDAY THE 13TH), Danielle Harris (HALLOWEEN), Dee Snider (TWISTED SISTER), Derek Mears (SWAMP THING), Bill Moseley (THE DEVIL'S REJECTS), Emma Bell (THE WALKING DEAD), Tony Todd (CANDYMAN), Joe Lynch (MAYHEM), Brea Grant (DEXTER), Felissa Rose (SLEEPAWAY CAMP), Neil Marshall (GAME OF THRONES), Ti West (HOUSE OF THE DEVIL), Kristina Klebe (HALLOWEEN), Lucky McKee (MAY), Clare Kramer (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER), Todd Farmer (MY BLOODY VALENTINE), Tiffany Shepis (VICTOR CROWLEY), Tom Holland (CHILD'S PLAY), Laura Ortiz (HOLLISTON), Darren Lynn Bousman (SAW), Zach Galligan (GREMLINS), Jeffrey Reddick (FINAL DESTINATION), Doug Benson (THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE), and Brian Quinn (IMPRACTICAL JOKERS).</p>
<h3><u><strong>THE HISTORY OF SCARY SLEEPOVER:</strong></u></h3>
<p>Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER originally ran from 2015 - 2016 with a Christmas Special in 2017. Full-length uncensored versions of episodes ran on ArieScope.com while ArieScope's YouTube Channel carried shorter, censored versions. The show was (and remains) free to watch no matter which platform you watched it on.  As beloved as the series may have become, unfortunately our model of making the show with our own money and giving it away to fans for free eventually took its toll on us. Producing the show was taking up all of our time and we were sinking further and further into debt the longer we worked on it. So it was with a heavy heart that we had to roll up our sleeping bags and say goodnight to the slumber parties after the 2017 Christmas Special. <br/><br/>The amount of work that goes into producing an episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER is on par with an episode of any network television reality show - only we were doing it without a budget of any kind whatsoever.  Not only is a crew required for every shoot but episodes can take anywhere from 40 to 60 hours  (in some cases far longer) to complete post-production. We were having to work through the nights and over the weekends around our actual production jobs in order to make SCARY SLEEPOVER happen, often times giving up paid work and falling behind on deadlines in our personal careers.  As much as we loved doing the show, no one involved could carry on producing a show where the people behind it were literally paying to work on it. So after 29 wonderful episodes, the reality of the situation won out and we called it a night.</p>
<h3><u><strong>WHAT PROMPTED THIS RESURRECTION? </strong></u></h3>
<p>Over the summer of 2019 two crucial things happened that caused us to start rethinking SCARY SLEEPOVER.  In July an article titled ""Adam Green Saved My Life"" was posted on NightmareNostalgia.com. In the piece, writer Landon Evanson bravely discussed his on going battle with depression and how SCARY SLEEPOVER had helped him through some of his darkest nights when he was having suicidal thoughts. It wasn't that the series possessed a magical cure for depression but by Landon connecting with the relationships and sincerity on display in SCARY SLEEPOVER, he saw just how fortunate his own friends make his life. We highly encourage you to read Landon's article <a href=""http://nightmarenostalgia.com/2019/07/13/adam-green-saved-my-life/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>It was Landon's story that first got us talking about resurrecting SCARY SLEEPOVER. Just like our show had helped him realize what he has in his own life, Landon's article helped us see what we have in our show. Landon, if you see this - thank you for showing us that what we do matters. We're so very grateful that you're still here and that our work was there to help you when you needed it! </p>
<p>Just two months later, our dear friend Sid Haig passed away. Sid was a major part of our ArieScope family having appeared in HATCHET 3, our sit-com HOLLISTON, several of our annual Halloween short films, an episode of our original series HORRIFIED, two episodes of THE MOVIE CRYPT podcast, and two episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER (his original episode in 2015 and the Christmas Special in 2017). While we had known that Sid was ill for a long time and though he had lived the fullest life a man could ever dream of living, his passing was still absolutely devastating to all of us. Sid had hundreds of films and television shows under his belt - not to mention countless interviews that he had given during his lifetime. Yet out of everything that fans could have turned to when he passed, it was Sid's 2015 episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER that many reached for to remember him with. His episode was suddenly viewed over 100,000 times within the first 48 hours of his passing and in turn, all of the episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER quickly began climbing up and up in views as a whole new audience discovered the series. Once again we began to question our decision for walking away from the show before ever asking the community we were serving if they would help us. We were ready to try and resurrect SCARY SLEEPOVER.  </p>
<p>After the financial hit that making the series had caused us the first time around, the most obvious change we knew we'd have to make was that our crew would need to be paid something for all of their hours of work this time. While our loyal crew may be willing to work on the show for far below any kind of standard industry rates, with bills to pay and children at home to feed... the days of everyone always working for free are over. It was also crucial to all of us that if we were to bring the series back certain technical areas of the production would need to be improved on. For instance, one of our biggest concerns is making sure that we can afford to have a professional sound mixer and operator on set this time around. In making the first two seasons of the show we had to throw out so many incredible moments due to unusable sound. </p>
<p>As an example, our final episode (the Christmas Special in 2017) was so plagued with sound problems that it was almost never released at all. Kane Hodder, Danielle Harris, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, and Felissa Rose were Adam Green's guests for that special episode. In the end, we knew that we couldn't not show the world such an incredible gathering with all of those horror icons having Christmas dinner and a slumber party together, so we fixed up the audio as best as we could and we released the episode with sound that legitimately made us ashamed. To make it worse, we had to throw out many wonderful moments that we captured between the group because the microphones we had weren't working at all. That night was such an incredible moment in time that will never happen again- (Sid would learn that he was seriously ill shortly after we shot) and our audio was unusable simply because we didn't have a budget to work with. It was heartbreaking. And we can't let that happen again. This time around we have to have help.</p>
<p>If you've already watched the first new episode that this campaign produced (Episode 3.1 ""Doug Benson"") then you can see just what an improvement having a little bit of a budget has made on a technical level. Our new crowd funded episodes look and sound so much better than the episodes from Seasons 1 or 2! It's a night and day difference thanks to YOUR help!</p>
<h3><u><strong>WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR:</strong></u></h3>
<p>In order to keep bringing you new episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER, in order to keep the series independent, and in order to keep the series free to watch and accessible to all... we're asking for a budget of $5,000 (USD) per episode. That's IT. Could we ask for more? Absolutely. Should we? Probably. But right now all we want is to be able to make the show for you again without it negatively effecting our lives and putting us in debt like it did before. For every $5,000 raised we will put a new episode into production. It's that simple. Ultimately you decide just how many episodes you'll get based on how much and how often you donate.</p>
<p>Given the size of SCARY SLEEPOVER's audience and how many times the episodes are viewed, the meager $5k per episode budget that we collectively arrived at is more than fair. It is the bare minimum we need to pay our crew somethingfor their work, to improve the quality of the show, and to keep the series free to watch on ArieScope.com and on ArieScope's YouTube channel - platforms that are readily accessible to all. Remember, not only does Indiegogo take 5% of what we raise as their own ""platform fee"" but they also automatically set aside 5% of whatever we raise as a contingency to cover ""chargebacks"" (backers who default on whatever they pledged). So that's 10% gone right off the bat. Then the banks charge fees on every individual pledge. Every donation that comes from someone within the US has 2.9% + .30 taken out for a ""transaction fee"" while donations that come from other countries have a much higher amount taken out plus a hefty ""transfer fee"" (at least $25 or more) on top of that!  Finally, at the end of the year we'll also need to pay taxes on every dollar that came in just like all US citizens have to do. We know this is all information that is likely just making your eyes glaze over and your head spin. No, you don't need to call an exorcist. It's unfortunately just how crowdfunding goes and there is no way around it. But hopefully you're getting a clear picture of just how much we're trying to make this work on as tight of a budget as possible.</p>
<h3><u><strong>""ONCE A NEW EPISODE IS GREEN-LIT, HOW LONG BEFORE WE CAN WATCH IT?""</strong></u></h3>
<p>Every time we hit another $5,000 goal we'll get started making an episode. Producing an episode can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months. It all depends on guest/crew availability but we usually move rather fast. Ideally we raise the funding quickly so that can start shooting episodes back to back and churning them out one right after the next, but we have to see how this goes. We'll post updates and include the most accurate ETA we can for when we expect the next episode to be ready. To be clear- this endeavor is not going to pay anyone enough to turn down production jobs and stand by waiting for the next episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER to get green-lit. Please be reasonable. We'll get new episodes made as fast as we can and in a timely fashion. Episodes will be released simultaneously on ArieScope.com and ArieScope's YouTube channel. The same exact version will be released on both platforms. Want to help see episodes get made faster? Share this campaign on social media and encourage others to donate! </p>
<p><i><strong>THIS CAMPAIGN ENDS ON AUGUST 31, 2020</strong>.</i> If things go well and we make a complete season (12 crowd funded episodes + 2 outtake episodes that we contribute on our own)...? Well, then we will most certainly do this again for a 4th season! If we don't even come close to a full season? Then we unfortunately need to listen to our audience and accept that the party is over. </p>
<h3><u><strong>""SO WHAT DO I GET FOR DONATING?""</strong></u></h3>
<p>You get THE SHOW!  Look, we know people love their buttons, posters, ""shout outs,"" shopping bags, T-shirts, and other crowdfunding rewards but we want to bring you as many episodes as possible for as low a production budget as possible. If we start creating and shipping a bunch of useless ""stuff"" all over the world we would need to raise WAY more per episode just to pay for all of it and we'd be spending our time shipping rewards instead of making the actual show. Donate because you want to watch new episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER, not because you want an official pencil sharpener or other random item with the show's logo on it. We're putting every dollar into the show, not squandering it on T-shirts.</p>
<p>OK, FINE!  We created some wicked cool rewards that won't take anything away from the budget of the show itself and require us to raise the minimum amount we need to raise just so that we can pay for ""Scary Sleepover"" hair ties, spatulas, staplers or other useless stuff that we all know you don't really need. Unfortunately, IndieGoGo's interface massively limits the amount of space where you can describe each reward so we've listed more thorough descriptions below. Remember- you can donate any amount you'd like. It's not like you have to purchase one of the rewards if you'd rather give less and just contribute what you can afford to give to help make the show happen!</p>
<p><strong>The Unlisted Reward =</strong>  This one is our reward to everyone who helps. For every 6 episodes that get green-lit we will create a 7th episode on our own that consists of outtakes and moments that you didn't see in the previous 6 episodes. With Seasons 1 and 2 we always did a mid-season and an end of season outtake episode. So just like the two previous seasons, we're only doing this for every 6 episodes that get green-lit. If the donations come to a complete stop after just 4 or 5 episodes? Well, that's unfortunately where the season ends. We'd love nothing more than to be able to do a full 14 episode season just like we used to (12 crowd funded episodes + 2 outtake episodes) but that's entirely up to you the audience.</p>
<p><strong>$50 = Scary Stream-over Party!</strong> When this next season of Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER is over you will receive a private invitation to an all-night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party"" with Adam and Arwen that is exclusively for backers who donated $50 or more. Please remember that at this point we have no idea how many episodes will ultimately become green-lit so we have no way of knowing exactly how many episodes will constitute Season 3. We have to play it by ear and see what happens. Point is- everyone in this tier and above will be invited to an all-night Scary Sleepover live stream where we all watch movies, play games, talk about our fears together, and pig out on junk food. If you've ever enjoyed one of THE MOVIE CRYPT's annual live ""Yorkiethons"" or participated in MOVIE CRYPT LIVE (a monthly live stream for Patrons of the podcast) - this is gonna be similar to that only better! When the season ends a weekend night will be announced for the ""Stream-over."" When that weekend arrives a private link to the stream will go out to everyone who purchased a reward this season. Adam and Arwen will be on the stream with everyone all night. Knowing them they will have some surprises up their sleeves so you never know who else might show up and crash the party! This exclusive live ""Stream-over"" will essentially recreate what you see Adam and his guests do on the show and most likely go for an 8-hour stretch like 7pm PST until 3am PST (or hours like that).  We will give everyone at least 3 week's notice for when the slumber party is going to happen. Our apologies if the night that this winds up taking place doesn't work for you but we're going to give everyone plenty of notice. Ideally this ""Stream-over"" will take place within a month of whenever the final episode of the season is released but for all we know Adam could be on set in the middle of directing a movie in Tunisia by then. Just know that one way or another we will make this event happen. We're all already looking forward to it!</p>
<p><strong>$100 = Thank You Credit!</strong> Not only will you get an invite to the all night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party"" listed above but you will be immortalized by having your name on screen at the end of an episode. (Watch the end of Episode 3.1 ""Doug Benson"" for an example.) This is sincerely a big deal to us as we're crediting you on screen right alongside our beloved crew. Having donated to and worked on crowd funded projects ourselves, one thing that we really hate to see is when the credits acknowledging the very people who made the project happen fly by so fast or are shoved up into the corner of the screen so small that no one could ever possibly read them. Hey, we get it. The average audience member immediately shuts off whatever they are watching once the credits start and with on-line content a ""play"" doesn't count as completed unless it plays until the end. That's why we do our ending credits for SCARY SLEEPOVER while there is something still happening - even if it is merely dialogue continuing on underneath the credits. We give people a reason to finish watching the entire episode. Therefore, everyone who ever watches an episode that you backed is going to see that you were part of making it happen. Please take this one seriously. We sure do as our crew is our family. To be acknowledged in our work alongside our brothers and sisters is an honor.</p>
<p><strong>$250 = Personalized ""Thank You"" video &amp; Early Access!</strong> Not only will you get all of the above (a thank you credit and an invite to the all night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party""), you'll also receive a private link to see the episode that you backed almost a full week ahead if its premiere on-line! Best of all, there will be a personalized introduction from Adam Green and Arwen thanking you for helping SCARY SLEEPOVER continue at the front of it! We debated offering this one for awhile as truthfully it takes a lot more time to make happen than you might think. (Any editors out there know how many hours it can actually take to create individual episodes for a variety of people, export them, and upload them to a private server.) But if you're going to back us this generously we want to make sure you see in our eyes just how appreciated you actually are. Sincerely, this one is a reward for us just as much as it may be a reward for you. A personalized video is the closest we can come to actually shaking your hand or full-on hugging you. You're a goddamn hero and we love you for caring this much about what we do. Let us tell you how we feel about you to your face. Just ask anyone who participated at this reward level for Episode 3.1 since that one is already out. They were not disappointed!</p>
<p><strong>$5000 = Executive Producer!</strong> This is as big as it gets because at this level you're one of us. By singlehandedly financing an episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER you will be credited on screen as the sole Executive Producer at the top of the episode. Your ""Executive Producer"" credit will join ""Created By"" and ""Guest Star"" as the only credits at the beginning of the episode! You'll also be invited to join us on set when the episode shoots. NOTE: You are responsible for getting yourself to our studio in Los Angeles. We will give you as much advance notice of the shoot night as possible. In fact, you'll find out what date it is being scheduled for when we do. Scheduling SCARY SLEEPOVER's shoot nights is a lot like a game of human Tetris in that we're juggling our guest's and our entire crew's availability. That can give us extremelylimited options. There have been times in the past where a guest tells us ""I'd love to do it! I'm in town tomorrow but then I'm not back again for 8 months. Can you make that work?"" and then we have to scramble to put the shoot together right up until the moment the guest arrives at the front door. Hopefully our audience backs enough episodes that we have some options for you as far as shoot nights go but if there aren't any other episodes in the pipeline we may not. For instance, if you can't get here for the very next episode we're going to be shooting, perhaps there are other shoot nights coming up that are a little bit further off in the calendar and that have more notice before they take place. Again, we have no way of knowing just how many episodes we're going to wind up making as it all depends on how this campaign goes. Just know that we'll do everything we possibly can to make the shoot happen on a night when you can be here for it. Please keep in mind that we can't control it if a guest or crew member suddenly falls ill or has an emergency arise and forces us to reschedule a shoot at the last minute any more than we can reschedule an entire shoot if you suddenly can't make it at the last minute. Our advice: Do this because you want to produce your own episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER and treat the set visit as an added bonus. Chances are good it will all work out but we have to be as thorough as possible in these descriptions.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, donations go toward the next episode in line being financed. It does not mean you continue to keep getting that reward for all future episodes as well. </p>
<p>So, there you go! Rewards!</p>
<h3><u><strong>NOW... LET'S DO THIS!</strong></u></h3>
<p>While over 1 million people may have already watched Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER, the reality is that very few are actually going to step up and help. They're going to wait and hope that other people donate - then watch the show. It's just how this goes. But if we didn't have at least a little bit of faith in our audience we wouldn't have gone through the effort of making the video you watched above or putting together this campaign. We believe in you!</p>
<p>This is the moment when you show us what SCARY SLEEPOVER means to you. Do the slumber parties continue or are they truly over? We sincerely hope that you'll consider backing us generously and continuously as the series (hopefully) continues on and on. Thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign.</p>
<p><i><strong>*** A NOTE TO THOSE WHO DONATED TO PART 1 OF THIS CAMPAIGN AFTER IT HAD PASSED $10,000 *** :</strong></i> At the time of this posting, our first campaign is sitting at $11,434. While the simplest way to keep things neat and easy to follow would be if we took that $1,434 and re-donated it into this campaign... if we did that then IndieGoGo would tax and take fees out of that money a second time. It would be a waste of your precious dollars that should be going towards episodes. At the same time, if we change our current easy to comprehend rule of ""every $5,000 = a new episode"" to be ""once we hit $3,566 episode 3.3 is green-lit... then once we hit $8,566 episode 3.4..."" you can see how confusing that will quickly become for everyone who checks out this campaign. So here's what we're doing... all ""thank you"" and ""early access"" rewards that were purchased as part of that $1,434 are going to be honored in Episode 3.2 ""Brian Quinn!"" That way you get your rewards earlier with the very next episode that comes out. (Obviously all end of season ""Scary Stream-Over Party"" rewards continue to be held back until the actual end of the season.) When this second part of the campaign launches it will automatically start at $0.00 so we'll stick with that. That way we keep everything easy to follow with the ""every $5,000 - a new episode"" rule. We're still obviously going to put every dollar of that $1,434 into the crowd fund. This second (and final) campaign only runs for 60 days. So wherever it ultimately ends up- we'll add $1,434 to that total. In the end, the money serves the exact same purpose (getting more episodes made) but this way it doesn't throw the total raised off the rails and require everyone to start doing math in order to figure out how close/far away we are from green-lighting the next episode. Keep in mind, IndieGoGo doesn't release a single dollar to us until 15 business days after a campaign closes. So it isn't like we could touch that $1,434 any sooner. Adding it to the total at the end of this final 60 day campaign is the same as saying it is in there now. We know this may be an extremely obvious solution but we'd always rather over explain and be as transparent as possible then have our beloved backers wondering what the plan is. Every dollar raised (from the first campaign and from this one) is going towards getting new episodes made - period. Those who donated among that extra $1434 raised in Part 1 are just going to get their ""thank you"" and ""early access"" rewards redeemed earlier! :)</p>
<p>Most sincerely-</p>

<p>SCARY SLEEPOVER: RESURRECTION VIDEO made by Sean Becker, Will Barratt, Adam Green, and Arwen. Massive thanks to Lola Barbare (""Arwen""), Jeremy Wanek (Arwen VFX), Kevin Barbare, and to Josh Ethier for letting us pretend to yell at you.</p>
</div></div>","SET YOUR OWN DONATION AND BACK THE SERIES WITH ANY AMOUNT YOU CAN! PART 1 OF THIS CAMPAIGN SAW TWO NEW EPISODES FUNDED AND SHOT! A THIRD NEW EPISODE REACHED FUNDING ON 8/16! EVERY $5,000 RAISED = A NEW EPISODE! PLEASE READ BELOW AND HELP KEEP THE SLUMBER PARTIES COMING!
UPDATED - JULY 1, 2020: Remember when we thought we were going to be able to just keep accepting donations on the original campaign page after the initial 60-day campaign period had ended? Well... although the original campaign page was indeed still accepting donations in the form of reward purchases  (YAY!)... unfortunately the original campaign page would no longer allow backers to set their own donation amount  (BOO!)... so here we are with PART 2 - the next (and final) part of the campaign to resurrect SCARY SLEEPOVER!  Same campaign, same rewards, same great show!  
We know that reading a ton of text can be tedious for some, but everything you could possibly need to know about this campaign is explained in detail below and Adam Green is very good about personally posting consistent and thorough updates in the ""Updates"" section of this campaign. Please note that since IndieGoGo's ""Rewards"" section (located to the right) has a very strict limit on the amount of text creators can use to describe each reward, we've thoroughly explained the rewards further down in this campaign overview. Please read the full description of each reward before purchasing one. Remember, you can always set your own donation amount and every dollar helps our effort to produce SCARY SLEEPOVER! Rewards are merely incentives for more generous donations. You do not need to purchase one of the rewards to help back the series!
Perhaps you've been following the resurrection of SCARY SLEEPOVER since Part 1 of this campaign launched in January. Perhaps you've already contributed once or twice and helped get the first THREE episodes of Season 3 produced. If you already know all of the details about the campaign and just have questions about how the money we had already raised is going roll over to Part 2 of our crowd fund effort- feel free to scroll down to the very bottom of this campaign description.
Perhaps you didn't know about the resurrection of SCARY SLEEPOVER until you watched one of the new episodes that this campaign has funded so far. Episode 3.1 ""Doug Benson"" premieres for the general public on ArieScope.com and on ArieScope's YouTube channel on July 4th while Episode 3.2 ""Brian Quinn"" will premiere on August 22nd! If so - WELCOME! We've been waiting for you! Between the above video and the information below you'll find everything you need to know about the resurrection of SCARY SLEEPOVER. This campaign was off to a solid start with two new episodes reaching funding before the COVID-19 pandemic arrived and totally wet the bed on our slumber party fun.  We temporarily paused our crowd funding efforts in March as the United States went into lockdown- but now that the country is starting to open up again it's time for the show to go on and for our resurrection efforts to continue!  We only have 60 days to get the rest of Season 3 green-lit. However many episodes reach funding in this second (and final) part of our campaign - that's our third season. Hopefully we get to make a full season for you! 
WHAT IS SCARY SLEEPOVER?
Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER is an on-line reality series that features some of the biggest names in genre entertainment like you've never seen them before... in their pajamas! In each episode a different celebrity artist joins filmmaker Adam Green (HATCHET, FROZEN) for a slumber party at his studio where they spend the night playing games, watching movies, eating junk food, and having extremely candid conversations that reveal their biggest real life fears. The 29 existing episodes that made up Seasons 1 and 2 have been watched over 1 million times between ArieScope.com and ArieScope's YouTube channel!It was Green's goal in creating SCARY SLEEPOVER to not only entertain audiences but to make a real connection between artists and fans. While the show may be inherently funny and contain a lot of truly hilarious moments, it is also bursting with genuine heart. Since every guest already has a personal relationship with Green they are comfortable opening up about themselves in an extremely honest and candid manner that you just don't find anywhere else. Through its many emotional and revealing moments SCARY SLEEPOVER has given fans a much deeper look at who these artists really are and just how much we all truly have in common as a community. 
THE GUESTS SO FAR:
Previous guests have include: Slash (GUNS N ROSES), Sid Haig (THE DEVIL'S REJECTS), Kane Hodder (FRIDAY THE 13TH), Danielle Harris (HALLOWEEN), Dee Snider (TWISTED SISTER), Derek Mears (SWAMP THING), Bill Moseley (THE DEVIL'S REJECTS), Emma Bell (THE WALKING DEAD), Tony Todd (CANDYMAN), Joe Lynch (MAYHEM), Brea Grant (DEXTER), Felissa Rose (SLEEPAWAY CAMP), Neil Marshall (GAME OF THRONES), Ti West (HOUSE OF THE DEVIL), Kristina Klebe (HALLOWEEN), Lucky McKee (MAY), Clare Kramer (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER), Todd Farmer (MY BLOODY VALENTINE), Tiffany Shepis (VICTOR CROWLEY), Tom Holland (CHILD'S PLAY), Laura Ortiz (HOLLISTON), Darren Lynn Bousman (SAW), Zach Galligan (GREMLINS), Jeffrey Reddick (FINAL DESTINATION), Doug Benson (THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE), and Brian Quinn (IMPRACTICAL JOKERS).
THE HISTORY OF SCARY SLEEPOVER:
Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER originally ran from 2015 - 2016 with a Christmas Special in 2017. Full-length uncensored versions of episodes ran on ArieScope.com while ArieScope's YouTube Channel carried shorter, censored versions. The show was (and remains) free to watch no matter which platform you watched it on.  As beloved as the series may have become, unfortunately our model of making the show with our own money and giving it away to fans for free eventually took its toll on us. Producing the show was taking up all of our time and we were sinking further and further into debt the longer we worked on it. So it was with a heavy heart that we had to roll up our sleeping bags and say goodnight to the slumber parties after the 2017 Christmas Special. The amount of work that goes into producing an episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER is on par with an episode of any network television reality show - only we were doing it without a budget of any kind whatsoever.  Not only is a crew required for every shoot but episodes can take anywhere from 40 to 60 hours  (in some cases far longer) to complete post-production. We were having to work through the nights and over the weekends around our actual production jobs in order to make SCARY SLEEPOVER happen, often times giving up paid work and falling behind on deadlines in our personal careers.  As much as we loved doing the show, no one involved could carry on producing a show where the people behind it were literally paying to work on it. So after 29 wonderful episodes, the reality of the situation won out and we called it a night.
WHAT PROMPTED THIS RESURRECTION? 
Over the summer of 2019 two crucial things happened that caused us to start rethinking SCARY SLEEPOVER.  In July an article titled ""Adam Green Saved My Life"" was posted on NightmareNostalgia.com. In the piece, writer Landon Evanson bravely discussed his on going battle with depression and how SCARY SLEEPOVER had helped him through some of his darkest nights when he was having suicidal thoughts. It wasn't that the series possessed a magical cure for depression but by Landon connecting with the relationships and sincerity on display in SCARY SLEEPOVER, he saw just how fortunate his own friends make his life. We highly encourage you to read Landon's article here.
It was Landon's story that first got us talking about resurrecting SCARY SLEEPOVER. Just like our show had helped him realize what he has in his own life, Landon's article helped us see what we have in our show. Landon, if you see this - thank you for showing us that what we do matters. We're so very grateful that you're still here and that our work was there to help you when you needed it! 
Just two months later, our dear friend Sid Haig passed away. Sid was a major part of our ArieScope family having appeared in HATCHET 3, our sit-com HOLLISTON, several of our annual Halloween short films, an episode of our original series HORRIFIED, two episodes of THE MOVIE CRYPT podcast, and two episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER (his original episode in 2015 and the Christmas Special in 2017). While we had known that Sid was ill for a long time and though he had lived the fullest life a man could ever dream of living, his passing was still absolutely devastating to all of us. Sid had hundreds of films and television shows under his belt - not to mention countless interviews that he had given during his lifetime. Yet out of everything that fans could have turned to when he passed, it was Sid's 2015 episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER that many reached for to remember him with. His episode was suddenly viewed over 100,000 times within the first 48 hours of his passing and in turn, all of the episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER quickly began climbing up and up in views as a whole new audience discovered the series. Once again we began to question our decision for walking away from the show before ever asking the community we were serving if they would help us. We were ready to try and resurrect SCARY SLEEPOVER.  
After the financial hit that making the series had caused us the first time around, the most obvious change we knew we'd have to make was that our crew would need to be paid something for all of their hours of work this time. While our loyal crew may be willing to work on the show for far below any kind of standard industry rates, with bills to pay and children at home to feed... the days of everyone always working for free are over. It was also crucial to all of us that if we were to bring the series back certain technical areas of the production would need to be improved on. For instance, one of our biggest concerns is making sure that we can afford to have a professional sound mixer and operator on set this time around. In making the first two seasons of the show we had to throw out so many incredible moments due to unusable sound. 
As an example, our final episode (the Christmas Special in 2017) was so plagued with sound problems that it was almost never released at all. Kane Hodder, Danielle Harris, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, and Felissa Rose were Adam Green's guests for that special episode. In the end, we knew that we couldn't not show the world such an incredible gathering with all of those horror icons having Christmas dinner and a slumber party together, so we fixed up the audio as best as we could and we released the episode with sound that legitimately made us ashamed. To make it worse, we had to throw out many wonderful moments that we captured between the group because the microphones we had weren't working at all. That night was such an incredible moment in time that will never happen again- (Sid would learn that he was seriously ill shortly after we shot) and our audio was unusable simply because we didn't have a budget to work with. It was heartbreaking. And we can't let that happen again. This time around we have to have help.
If you've already watched the first new episode that this campaign produced (Episode 3.1 ""Doug Benson"") then you can see just what an improvement having a little bit of a budget has made on a technical level. Our new crowd funded episodes look and sound so much better than the episodes from Seasons 1 or 2! It's a night and day difference thanks to YOUR help!
WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR:
In order to keep bringing you new episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER, in order to keep the series independent, and in order to keep the series free to watch and accessible to all... we're asking for a budget of $5,000 (USD) per episode. That's IT. Could we ask for more? Absolutely. Should we? Probably. But right now all we want is to be able to make the show for you again without it negatively effecting our lives and putting us in debt like it did before. For every $5,000 raised we will put a new episode into production. It's that simple. Ultimately you decide just how many episodes you'll get based on how much and how often you donate.
Given the size of SCARY SLEEPOVER's audience and how many times the episodes are viewed, the meager $5k per episode budget that we collectively arrived at is more than fair. It is the bare minimum we need to pay our crew somethingfor their work, to improve the quality of the show, and to keep the series free to watch on ArieScope.com and on ArieScope's YouTube channel - platforms that are readily accessible to all. Remember, not only does Indiegogo take 5% of what we raise as their own ""platform fee"" but they also automatically set aside 5% of whatever we raise as a contingency to cover ""chargebacks"" (backers who default on whatever they pledged). So that's 10% gone right off the bat. Then the banks charge fees on every individual pledge. Every donation that comes from someone within the US has 2.9% + .30 taken out for a ""transaction fee"" while donations that come from other countries have a much higher amount taken out plus a hefty ""transfer fee"" (at least $25 or more) on top of that!  Finally, at the end of the year we'll also need to pay taxes on every dollar that came in just like all US citizens have to do. We know this is all information that is likely just making your eyes glaze over and your head spin. No, you don't need to call an exorcist. It's unfortunately just how crowdfunding goes and there is no way around it. But hopefully you're getting a clear picture of just how much we're trying to make this work on as tight of a budget as possible.
""ONCE A NEW EPISODE IS GREEN-LIT, HOW LONG BEFORE WE CAN WATCH IT?""
Every time we hit another $5,000 goal we'll get started making an episode. Producing an episode can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months. It all depends on guest/crew availability but we usually move rather fast. Ideally we raise the funding quickly so that can start shooting episodes back to back and churning them out one right after the next, but we have to see how this goes. We'll post updates and include the most accurate ETA we can for when we expect the next episode to be ready. To be clear- this endeavor is not going to pay anyone enough to turn down production jobs and stand by waiting for the next episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER to get green-lit. Please be reasonable. We'll get new episodes made as fast as we can and in a timely fashion. Episodes will be released simultaneously on ArieScope.com and ArieScope's YouTube channel. The same exact version will be released on both platforms. Want to help see episodes get made faster? Share this campaign on social media and encourage others to donate! 
THIS CAMPAIGN ENDS ON AUGUST 31, 2020. If things go well and we make a complete season (12 crowd funded episodes + 2 outtake episodes that we contribute on our own)...? Well, then we will most certainly do this again for a 4th season! If we don't even come close to a full season? Then we unfortunately need to listen to our audience and accept that the party is over. 
""SO WHAT DO I GET FOR DONATING?""
You get THE SHOW!  Look, we know people love their buttons, posters, ""shout outs,"" shopping bags, T-shirts, and other crowdfunding rewards but we want to bring you as many episodes as possible for as low a production budget as possible. If we start creating and shipping a bunch of useless ""stuff"" all over the world we would need to raise WAY more per episode just to pay for all of it and we'd be spending our time shipping rewards instead of making the actual show. Donate because you want to watch new episodes of SCARY SLEEPOVER, not because you want an official pencil sharpener or other random item with the show's logo on it. We're putting every dollar into the show, not squandering it on T-shirts.
OK, FINE!  We created some wicked cool rewards that won't take anything away from the budget of the show itself and require us to raise the minimum amount we need to raise just so that we can pay for ""Scary Sleepover"" hair ties, spatulas, staplers or other useless stuff that we all know you don't really need. Unfortunately, IndieGoGo's interface massively limits the amount of space where you can describe each reward so we've listed more thorough descriptions below. Remember- you can donate any amount you'd like. It's not like you have to purchase one of the rewards if you'd rather give less and just contribute what you can afford to give to help make the show happen!
The Unlisted Reward =  This one is our reward to everyone who helps. For every 6 episodes that get green-lit we will create a 7th episode on our own that consists of outtakes and moments that you didn't see in the previous 6 episodes. With Seasons 1 and 2 we always did a mid-season and an end of season outtake episode. So just like the two previous seasons, we're only doing this for every 6 episodes that get green-lit. If the donations come to a complete stop after just 4 or 5 episodes? Well, that's unfortunately where the season ends. We'd love nothing more than to be able to do a full 14 episode season just like we used to (12 crowd funded episodes + 2 outtake episodes) but that's entirely up to you the audience.
$50 = Scary Stream-over Party! When this next season of Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER is over you will receive a private invitation to an all-night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party"" with Adam and Arwen that is exclusively for backers who donated $50 or more. Please remember that at this point we have no idea how many episodes will ultimately become green-lit so we have no way of knowing exactly how many episodes will constitute Season 3. We have to play it by ear and see what happens. Point is- everyone in this tier and above will be invited to an all-night Scary Sleepover live stream where we all watch movies, play games, talk about our fears together, and pig out on junk food. If you've ever enjoyed one of THE MOVIE CRYPT's annual live ""Yorkiethons"" or participated in MOVIE CRYPT LIVE (a monthly live stream for Patrons of the podcast) - this is gonna be similar to that only better! When the season ends a weekend night will be announced for the ""Stream-over."" When that weekend arrives a private link to the stream will go out to everyone who purchased a reward this season. Adam and Arwen will be on the stream with everyone all night. Knowing them they will have some surprises up their sleeves so you never know who else might show up and crash the party! This exclusive live ""Stream-over"" will essentially recreate what you see Adam and his guests do on the show and most likely go for an 8-hour stretch like 7pm PST until 3am PST (or hours like that).  We will give everyone at least 3 week's notice for when the slumber party is going to happen. Our apologies if the night that this winds up taking place doesn't work for you but we're going to give everyone plenty of notice. Ideally this ""Stream-over"" will take place within a month of whenever the final episode of the season is released but for all we know Adam could be on set in the middle of directing a movie in Tunisia by then. Just know that one way or another we will make this event happen. We're all already looking forward to it!
$100 = Thank You Credit! Not only will you get an invite to the all night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party"" listed above but you will be immortalized by having your name on screen at the end of an episode. (Watch the end of Episode 3.1 ""Doug Benson"" for an example.) This is sincerely a big deal to us as we're crediting you on screen right alongside our beloved crew. Having donated to and worked on crowd funded projects ourselves, one thing that we really hate to see is when the credits acknowledging the very people who made the project happen fly by so fast or are shoved up into the corner of the screen so small that no one could ever possibly read them. Hey, we get it. The average audience member immediately shuts off whatever they are watching once the credits start and with on-line content a ""play"" doesn't count as completed unless it plays until the end. That's why we do our ending credits for SCARY SLEEPOVER while there is something still happening - even if it is merely dialogue continuing on underneath the credits. We give people a reason to finish watching the entire episode. Therefore, everyone who ever watches an episode that you backed is going to see that you were part of making it happen. Please take this one seriously. We sure do as our crew is our family. To be acknowledged in our work alongside our brothers and sisters is an honor.
$250 = Personalized ""Thank You"" video & Early Access! Not only will you get all of the above (a thank you credit and an invite to the all night, on-line ""Scary Stream-over Party""), you'll also receive a private link to see the episode that you backed almost a full week ahead if its premiere on-line! Best of all, there will be a personalized introduction from Adam Green and Arwen thanking you for helping SCARY SLEEPOVER continue at the front of it! We debated offering this one for awhile as truthfully it takes a lot more time to make happen than you might think. (Any editors out there know how many hours it can actually take to create individual episodes for a variety of people, export them, and upload them to a private server.) But if you're going to back us this generously we want to make sure you see in our eyes just how appreciated you actually are. Sincerely, this one is a reward for us just as much as it may be a reward for you. A personalized video is the closest we can come to actually shaking your hand or full-on hugging you. You're a goddamn hero and we love you for caring this much about what we do. Let us tell you how we feel about you to your face. Just ask anyone who participated at this reward level for Episode 3.1 since that one is already out. They were not disappointed!
$5000 = Executive Producer! This is as big as it gets because at this level you're one of us. By singlehandedly financing an episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER you will be credited on screen as the sole Executive Producer at the top of the episode. Your ""Executive Producer"" credit will join ""Created By"" and ""Guest Star"" as the only credits at the beginning of the episode! You'll also be invited to join us on set when the episode shoots. NOTE: You are responsible for getting yourself to our studio in Los Angeles. We will give you as much advance notice of the shoot night as possible. In fact, you'll find out what date it is being scheduled for when we do. Scheduling SCARY SLEEPOVER's shoot nights is a lot like a game of human Tetris in that we're juggling our guest's and our entire crew's availability. That can give us extremelylimited options. There have been times in the past where a guest tells us ""I'd love to do it! I'm in town tomorrow but then I'm not back again for 8 months. Can you make that work?"" and then we have to scramble to put the shoot together right up until the moment the guest arrives at the front door. Hopefully our audience backs enough episodes that we have some options for you as far as shoot nights go but if there aren't any other episodes in the pipeline we may not. For instance, if you can't get here for the very next episode we're going to be shooting, perhaps there are other shoot nights coming up that are a little bit further off in the calendar and that have more notice before they take place. Again, we have no way of knowing just how many episodes we're going to wind up making as it all depends on how this campaign goes. Just know that we'll do everything we possibly can to make the shoot happen on a night when you can be here for it. Please keep in mind that we can't control it if a guest or crew member suddenly falls ill or has an emergency arise and forces us to reschedule a shoot at the last minute any more than we can reschedule an entire shoot if you suddenly can't make it at the last minute. Our advice: Do this because you want to produce your own episode of SCARY SLEEPOVER and treat the set visit as an added bonus. Chances are good it will all work out but we have to be as thorough as possible in these descriptions.
Keep in mind, donations go toward the next episode in line being financed. It does not mean you continue to keep getting that reward for all future episodes as well. 
So, there you go! Rewards!
NOW... LET'S DO THIS!
While over 1 million people may have already watched Adam Green's SCARY SLEEPOVER, the reality is that very few are actually going to step up and help. They're going to wait and hope that other people donate - then watch the show. It's just how this goes. But if we didn't have at least a little bit of faith in our audience we wouldn't have gone through the effort of making the video you watched above or putting together this campaign. We believe in you!
This is the moment when you show us what SCARY SLEEPOVER means to you. Do the slumber parties continue or are they truly over? We sincerely hope that you'll consider backing us generously and continuously as the series (hopefully) continues on and on. Thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign.
*** A NOTE TO THOSE WHO DONATED TO PART 1 OF THIS CAMPAIGN AFTER IT HAD PASSED $10,000 *** : At the time of this posting, our first campaign is sitting at $11,434. While the simplest way to keep things neat and easy to follow would be if we took that $1,434 and re-donated it into this campaign... if we did that then IndieGoGo would tax and take fees out of that money a second time. It would be a waste of your precious dollars that should be going towards episodes. At the same time, if we change our current easy to comprehend rule of ""every $5,000 = a new episode"" to be ""once we hit $3,566 episode 3.3 is green-lit... then once we hit $8,566 episode 3.4..."" you can see how confusing that will quickly become for everyone who checks out this campaign. So here's what we're doing... all ""thank you"" and ""early access"" rewards that were purchased as part of that $1,434 are going to be honored in Episode 3.2 ""Brian Quinn!"" That way you get your rewards earlier with the very next episode that comes out. (Obviously all end of season ""Scary Stream-Over Party"" rewards continue to be held back until the actual end of the season.) When this second part of the campaign launches it will automatically start at $0.00 so we'll stick with that. That way we keep everything easy to follow with the ""every $5,000 - a new episode"" rule. We're still obviously going to put every dollar of that $1,434 into the crowd fund. This second (and final) campaign only runs for 60 days. So wherever it ultimately ends up- we'll add $1,434 to that total. In the end, the money serves the exact same purpose (getting more episodes made) but this way it doesn't throw the total raised off the rails and require everyone to start doing math in order to figure out how close/far away we are from green-lighting the next episode. Keep in mind, IndieGoGo doesn't release a single dollar to us until 15 business days after a campaign closes. So it isn't like we could touch that $1,434 any sooner. Adding it to the total at the end of this final 60 day campaign is the same as saying it is in there now. We know this may be an extremely obvious solution but we'd always rather over explain and be as transparent as possible then have our beloved backers wondering what the plan is. Every dollar raised (from the first campaign and from this one) is going towards getting new episodes made - period. Those who donated among that extra $1434 raised in Part 1 are just going to get their ""thank you"" and ""early access"" rewards redeemed earlier! :)
Most sincerely-
The ArieScope Family

<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>We are living in a society where the notion promoting accomplishments without proper acknowledgements is acceptable. As the trend of women in professional and political careers begin to grow, the roles and responsibilities of their positions becomes a high demand. However, the stress in powerful leadership positions plays an effect mentally and physically. </p>
<p><br/>How does the strong, independent woman cope with being a leader without the feeling of being alone? In Patricia’s Independence, it portrays the lifestyle of a career driven woman who suffers the consequences of selfish actions and the struggle with overcoming an addiction.</p>
<p><br/>The film also takes a look at how Patricia’s selfish behavior is affecting her family. She has to make a choice whether her demanding career is worth the sacrifice with losing quality time at home or whether she is flexible enough to spend time with them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>“The demands and responsibilities in my career path can be challenging. There are several women that I know who has made ultimate sacrifices with their careers just to make sure they are home on time to put their little ones to bed. This film represents the balance between work and family and the importance of seeking help from friends and family.” </i> - Producer/Creator - Felicia Johnson</p>
<p><strong>About the Film</strong></p>
<p>Patricia Watkins is a career driven marketing consultant who is always on a tight schedule. She is married to Cecil Watkins, a district attorney, a mother to her daughter Tasha and raising her nephew, Brandon. She remains on a tight schedule and tends to cram and complete all of her responsibilities in one day. Her boss wants her to attend an important meeting with a client but it conflicts with her schedule. She promised her nephew Brandon to attend his baseball game. Her husband Cecil tries to offer his help to ease her schedule but she refuses the help from him due to her selfish attitude. Patricia also suffers from an opioid addiction. She constantly takes them to keep her alert throughout the day. However, it ultimately ruins her busy schedule and ultimately forces her to slow down.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>The Approach</strong></p>
<p>Our approach shows a fast paced and busy environment for Patricia. The beginning shot shows a wide POV of her family sitting together in the kitchen eating breakfast. However, Patricia does not join them. She fixes their plates, jot down their activities on her phone and leaves the room. There is a slow motion shot of her walking down the street with her sunshades and a cup of coffee as she enters her office. It shows the audience her inner self-centered diva attitude. Since Patricia’s routine tends to be quick, there are quick close up shots of her grabbing her keys, phone and popping her opioid pills before she moves on to the next activity. When she goes to an event that does not relate to her job, she either doesn’t pay attention or becomes tired. During Tasha’s dance practice, Patricia is busy answering emails on her phone while bobbing her head to the music. When she attends Cecil’s gala for his law firm, there is a close up shot of her yawning while popping another opioid pill. The audience will feel the sense of her always being the center of attention.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>The Tone</strong></p>
<p>The tone approach in this film is shown through Patricia’s interactions between her family and her job. Her family environment seems too stern and almost treated like a business. There is a shot of Tasha and Brandon sitting on the bench waiting for Patrcia outside of school. Yet, there is no interaction between them at all. The color scheme is dim, yet the students that surround them are colorful. There are certain tensions between Cecil and Patricia. When Cecil tries to offer his help, Patricia cuts him off while they talk and convinces him that she can do it on her own. The audience can get a sense that Cecil’s patience is running short. Patricia loves Brandon and Tasha. But she struggles with showing them the nurturing love they deserve. The audience can see that Patricia rather shows her support by dropping them off to their practices and games. Yet she rarely pays attention to them.  When Patricia is in her office, she is vibrant, communicative and there are repetitive phrases that she uses such as “I’ve got this” or “How can I help?” Her job is her motivator rather than her family.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>The Characters</strong></p>
<p><strong>Patricia Watkins</strong> – Patricia is a well-educated and self-centered DC lobbyist who takes the meaning of “doing bad all by myself” to another level. She is the top lobbyist at the Smith Firm and has landed several accounts for the company. She is even considered a “gold mine” in the eyes of her supervisor Stuart Smith. </p>
<p>Patricia is addicted to her work and treats her family like a business. Tasha and Brandon must maintain a 3.5 GPA, be involved in at least 2 activities, they have to send daily reports of their daily schedules and they even have to maintain a certain weight and size. She constantly rejects spending quality time with Cecil since she is always spending the majority of her time at the office. However, when it comes to classy affair events for couples, she will take the time to be with him.</p>
<p>Her selfish attitude is affecting her family emotionally. She will be faced with situations that will force her to change her perspective from independent into having a nurturing and supportive personality.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Cecil Watkins</strong> - Is a district attorney in Washington, DC. He met Patricia at George Washington University and the two married immediately after graduation. They have a daughter named Tasha. He also takes care of his nephew Brandon. He is an easy going kind of guy and has been accustomed with Patricia taking control of things that he should handle. He is now at a point where he is tired of her selfish attitude and wants to take back his role as head of the household.</p>
<p><strong>Tasha Watkins</strong> - Tasha is the daughter of Cecil and Patricia. She is smart, witty, a straight ""A"" student and is heavily involved in her dance team and playing the piano. She challenges herself daily to be the best at everything. She is eager to attend NYU to receive a scholarship in music. When she was in the accident with Patricia, she sprained her wrist which is giving her difficulty to play the piano. She blames Patricia for her injury but she tries to maintain her status of challenging herself to stay on top. </p>
<p><strong>Brandon Taylor</strong> – Brandon is the nephew of Patricia and the son of Cecil and Annette. He is passionate about baseball and spends most of his time with his teammates.

</div></div>","The Story
We are living in a society where the notion promoting accomplishments without proper acknowledgements is acceptable. As the trend of women in professional and political careers begin to grow, the roles and responsibilities of their positions becomes a high demand. However, the stress in powerful leadership positions plays an effect mentally and physically. 
How does the strong, independent woman cope with being a leader without the feeling of being alone? In Patricia’s Independence, it portrays the lifestyle of a career driven woman who suffers the consequences of selfish actions and the struggle with overcoming an addiction.
The film also takes a look at how Patricia’s selfish behavior is affecting her family. She has to make a choice whether her demanding career is worth the sacrifice with losing quality time at home or whether she is flexible enough to spend time with them.
 
“The demands and responsibilities in my career path can be challenging. There are several women that I know who has made ultimate sacrifices with their careers just to make sure they are home on time to put their little ones to bed. This film represents the balance between work and family and the importance of seeking help from friends and family.”  - Producer/Creator - Felicia Johnson
About the Film
Patricia Watkins is a career driven marketing consultant who is always on a tight schedule. She is married to Cecil Watkins, a district attorney, a mother to her daughter Tasha and raising her nephew, Brandon. She remains on a tight schedule and tends to cram and complete all of her responsibilities in one day. Her boss wants her to attend an important meeting with a client but it conflicts with her schedule. She promised her nephew Brandon to attend his baseball game. Her husband Cecil tries to offer his help to ease her schedule but she refuses the help from him due to her selfish attitude. Patricia also suffers from an opioid addiction. She constantly takes them to keep her alert throughout the day. However, it ultimately ruins her busy schedule and ultimately forces her to slow down. 
The Approach
Our approach shows a fast paced and busy environment for Patricia. The beginning shot shows a wide POV of her family sitting together in the kitchen eating breakfast. However, Patricia does not join them. She fixes their plates, jot down their activities on her phone and leaves the room. There is a slow motion shot of her walking down the street with her sunshades and a cup of coffee as she enters her office. It shows the audience her inner self-centered diva attitude. Since Patricia’s routine tends to be quick, there are quick close up shots of her grabbing her keys, phone and popping her opioid pills before she moves on to the next activity. When she goes to an event that does not relate to her job, she either doesn’t pay attention or becomes tired. During Tasha’s dance practice, Patricia is busy answering emails on her phone while bobbing her head to the music. When she attends Cecil’s gala for his law firm, there is a close up shot of her yawning while popping another opioid pill. The audience will feel the sense of her always being the center of attention. 
The Tone
The tone approach in this film is shown through Patricia’s interactions between her family and her job. Her family environment seems too stern and almost treated like a business. There is a shot of Tasha and Brandon sitting on the bench waiting for Patrcia outside of school. Yet, there is no interaction between them at all. The color scheme is dim, yet the students that surround them are colorful. There are certain tensions between Cecil and Patricia. When Cecil tries to offer his help, Patricia cuts him off while they talk and convinces him that she can do it on her own. The audience can get a sense that Cecil’s patience is running short. Patricia loves Brandon and Tasha. But she struggles with showing them the nurturing love they deserve. The audience can see that Patricia rather shows her support by dropping them off to their practices and games. Yet she rarely pays attention to them.  When Patricia is in her office, she is vibrant, communicative and there are repetitive phrases that she uses such as “I’ve got this” or “How can I help?” Her job is her motivator rather than her family. 
The Characters
Patricia Watkins – Patricia is a well-educated and self-centered DC lobbyist who takes the meaning of “doing bad all by myself” to another level. She is the top lobbyist at the Smith Firm and has landed several accounts for the company. She is even considered a “gold mine” in the eyes of her supervisor Stuart Smith. 
Patricia is addicted to her work and treats her family like a business. Tasha and Brandon must maintain a 3.5 GPA, be involved in at least 2 activities, they have to send daily reports of their daily schedules and they even have to maintain a certain weight and size. She constantly rejects spending quality time with Cecil since she is always spending the majority of her time at the office. However, when it comes to classy affair events for couples, she will take the time to be with him.
Her selfish attitude is affecting her family emotionally. She will be faced with situations that will force her to change her perspective from independent into having a nurturing and supportive personality.
Cecil Watkins - Is a district attorney in Washington, DC. He met Patricia at George Washington University and the two married immediately after graduation. They have a daughter named Tasha.

He is now at a point where he is tired of her selfish attitude and wants to take back his role as head of the household.
Tasha Watkins - Tasha is the daughter of Cecil and Patricia. She is smart, witty, a straight ""A"" student and is heavily involved in her dance team and playing the piano. She challenges herself daily to be the best at everything. She is eager to attend NYU to receive a scholarship in music. When she was in the accident with Patricia, she sprained her wrist which is giving her difficulty to play the piano. She blames Patricia for her injury but she tries to maintain her status of challenging herself to stay on top. 
Brandon Taylor – Brandon is the nephew of Patricia and the son of Cecil and Annette. He is passionate about baseball and spends most of his time with his teammates.

However, he begins to realize Patricia constantly misses his baseball games and makes promises that she can't keep.

<h3>It's the generation of idiotic choices!</h3>
<p>Let's just be honest, the last couple generations have found entertainment in some pretty crude humor. Whether it be from constantly making up different challenges, depending if you are a millennial or a Gen Z, you've seen the rise of the plank challenge, cinnamon challenge, mannequin challenge, tide pod eating challenge... you get the picture.

Without the cause and effect of causing harm to ourselves or others, of course, because that's how people end up in prison. 
A Budget Breakdown
Although we are trying to make a fun and entertaining web series, we are a professional team who have aspired to do something of this magnitude for quite some time. 
Our budget breaks down into separate parts, which include indiegogo being only 25% of what we need to reach our goal and make this series happen. 
The rest of our budget will be coming from certain sponsors we reach out too, When those people are brought on, we will be telling all of you! The 75% will come from independent sponsors, businesses, and community groups. 
The portion you would be helping with is to pay the costs of having an amazing animator come onto this project, and create the world of the two little f*cking wizards themselves, Po and Foster. 

Why Give if I don't receive?
The great thing is we have some great perks for people who donate and become contributors to the project, check to the side to see our perks and find one that best suites you.
Are you a student and can barely afford to live? Can you only give 5 or 10 dollars? Don't hesitate, everything helps and we appreciate the people who donate any amount to our show!
Our perks range from shout outs, to the original concept art, wrists bands and much more! 

Can't contribute? Have no fear!
Don't worry we understand, But if you love this project idea and want to see it flourish check out our Facebook Page at: https://www.facebook.com/Little-Fcking-Wizards-... 
Share the campaign and concept video you saw above! The more views and shares the greater the chances are people will see this and want to contribute! 
No time to share or don't have access to any of the social medias? That's okay too, however you're seeing this message keep us in your minds and tell your friends the good ol' fashioned way, by mouth when you see them. You're probably going to want to just share it, but we are open to anything, if you just want to keep us in your thoughts that's always good for us too.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As both an entertainment journalist and a person who loves/consumes way too much TV, I often find myself thinking about the LGBTQ themed shows and movies that are being produced.</p>
<p>Even when I love a show or movie - like <i>Call Me By Your Name - </i>I still have often left feeling frustrated by who is being featured in those prominent roles. </p>
<p>I quickly realized, that far too often LGBTQ people are not given the chance to tell their own stories.</p>
<p>Last year, I did a research piece for <i>Them </i>about Hollywood's legacy of homophobic hiring practices. While writing this article, I began to fully grasp how Hollywood has created an internal culture where heterosexual actors are not only cast in gay roles, but are also commended as being ""brave"" for playing these parts. Meanwhile, openly LGBTQ actors are often not given the opportunity to play leading LGBTQ roles, or leading heterosexual roles. All of this seems to be done under some belief that mainstream audiences will be too freaked out to attend a ""fully gay movie"" or watch a ""fully gay show"" where not only are the characters gay on screen, but the actors are, as well, in real life.</p>
<p>I call bullshit. </p>
<p>And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that if you want change, you'd better try to change it yourself. </p>
<p>I recently began doing stand up comedy, and I've writing for many years. As I began crafting stand up material, I started to visualize scenes in my head, which eventually lead to the creation of a ""modern day gay"" character, and a longer narrative.</p>
<p>Thus, Modern Day Gay, the web series, was born. I know this doesn't mean much coming from me since I wrote it, but I really do believe it's going to be funny, provocative, and enjoyable. YAY! </p>
<p>This show will follow a totally fictional, anal retentive, controlling, anxiety ridden, uptight, yet SOMEHOW SUPER LIKABLE,  character named...Seamus...who is trying to find love/himself/meaning/mental stability in the wake of a longterm relationship ending abruptly. It will fictionally portray the LOL moments of trying to date, get laid, get a ring on your lil finger, start a family, etc. as a gay man in the post-marriage equality world. </p>
<p>I want to take Modern Day Gay from being words on a page, to being a quality produced, funny web series. I want to use Modern Day Gay as a platform that uses humor to unpack issues that affect people in the LGBTQ community, and to unpack issues that affect people. Period.</p>
<p>I want to use Modern Day Gay to challenge Hollywood's belief that a show with a gay main character, or even 'gay' in the title, can only be watched and enjoyed by gay people. </p>
<p>Making a web series is, unfortunately, expensive if you want to do it right. Your contribution will help cover the costs of film equipment, paying a crew, paying actors, post production, and marketing and distribution. </p>
<p>Hollywood crews all too often underrepresent women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and people who identify as being in multiple of those groups, and with Modern Day Gay, we are committed to doing the exact opposite, both onscreen and off. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Breaking it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The $10,000 mark is a minimum amount needed to be able to create multiple episodes. The more money we can raise, the more episodes we make. NOBODY LIKES A CLIFFHANGER, so please help us raise enough so we don't have to stop in the middle of the season ^_^</li>
<li>Depending on how much you are able to give, we have some CUTE perks! From stickers, to t-shirts, to a launch party, to producer credits, WE.HAVE.IT.ALL.! </li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will just make less episodes. BUT THAT WOULD BE SAD SO PLEASE HELP US EXCEED OUR GOAL &lt;3 &lt;3</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The difference your contribution will make:</p>
<p>- Help finance a project that prioritizes giving opportunities to people who are often overlooked in Hollywood. </p>
<p>- Help create a platform to talk about important social issues while LOLing but not being insensitive! </p>
<p>- Prove to Hollywood that LGBTQ shows with LGBTQ actors can thrive, be financially successful, commercially popular, and watched by diverse audiences without having to prominently feature straight actors playing the lead LGBTQ roles or straightwashing the content! </p>
<p>As a writer, comedian, and A GAY MAN WITH A LOT TO SAY, I am so excited for this project! I really believe in it, and if you are curious, but are not sold, then please reach out to me. I would be happy to chat more about it over the phone!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the major challenges I foresee is longterm funding. I plan to overcome this challenge by trying to fund the entire first season up front, and then marketing the sh*t out of it, so the second season can be funded by (cute, not freaky!) sponsors (whose values are not questionable!). </p>
<p>Another risk is HAVING TOO MUCH FUN and leaving Hollywood producers SHOOK when they realize gay people can play gay roles! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I totally understand not everyone can give money, but there are many other ways you can help! IF think this project sounds chic of the week and/or important, then please send it to people you know who might be interested in learning more!</p>
<p>When it comes to marketing, nothing is more powerful than a share on social media!! I just made up that statistic, but it could be true, so PLEASE SHARE THIS ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, INSTAGRAM, etc.! Follow @SeamusKirst and @ModernDayGay and tag both accounts!</p>

<p><u><strong>OUR STORY AND CAMPAIGN:</strong></u></p>
<p>Producers Toni D'Antonio, Lou Martini, Jr., writer/producer Jon Saks and actress Kathy Searle are raising funds for a new, original Television Series called Mooch. It's a unique, hilarious journey of two city slicker sisters on the lam, but for two very different reasons. An embarrassing viral video derails the acting career of one sister (Kathy Searle), forcing her to go into hiding with the only person she can trust, her estranged sister, a former ex-mob wife hiding in the witness protection program (Toni D'Antonio). How their worlds collide in the middle of nowhere, USA, along with its cast of crazy supporting players creating a tremendous ensemble and the wit and imagination of Jon Saks words will surprise and delight audiences. Famous actress with pee tape? Check. Ex-Mafia wife in Witness Protection? Check. Hilarity? Most definitely.</p>
<p>With a cast of talented and recognizable actors bringing these flawed, identifiable, and funny characters to life, we feel confident that this new show will fare extremely well in the comedy television marketplace. Our ultimate goal is to be picked up by a major network, however, cable and digital platforms provide enormous oppotunties and options for distribution and exhibition as well. </p>
<p>A new, fun mash up of Thelma and Louise, The Heat, The Sweetest Thing, Frankie and Grace, My Blue Heaven and Two Broke Girls.</p>

<h3>L.Y.F.E. is REAL!</h3>
<h3>Welcome To The Good L.Y.F.E.</h3>
<p>My name is Jerail Fennell, and I am the creator of L.Y.F.E., a YouTube Series that I created during the Global Coronavirus Pandemic. I wanted to tell an authentic story about four college students trying to maneuver through Love. Youth. Freedom. and Education.  If you're a college graduate, current college student, or just someone making your way through L.Y.F.E. as well, this show will hit home with you! </p>
<p>Our campaign is simple. We are seeking to raise funds to complete season one of L.Y.F.E. If you loved episode one, then you are in for the ride of your life. During season one, we touch on important topics surrounding us today, including the BLM movement, #MeToo, Depression in College, Consent, Sexual Relations, Domestic Violence, and much more. We have eight episodes of L.Y.F.E. written and two filmed. </p>
<p>Your contribution will allow us to tell this coming of age story that needs to be told. There is some story that will resinate with you in some way. You will also be supporting a group of  black actors, writers, and directors. No amount is too small, really. </p>

Welcome To The Good L.Y.F.E.
My name is Jerail Fennell, and I am the creator of L.Y.F.E., a YouTube Series that I created during the Global Coronavirus Pandemic. I wanted to tell an authentic story about four college students trying to maneuver through Love. Youth. Freedom. and Education.  If you're a college graduate, current college student, or just someone making your way through L.Y.F.E. as well, this show will hit home with you! 
Our campaign is simple. We are seeking to raise funds to complete season one of L.Y.F.E. If you loved episode one, then you are in for the ride of your life. During season one, we touch on important topics surrounding us today, including the BLM movement, #MeToo, Depression in College, Consent, Sexual Relations, Domestic Violence, and much more. We have eight episodes of L.Y.F.E. written and two filmed. 
Your contribution will allow us to tell this coming of age story that needs to be told. There is some story that will resinate with you in some way. You will also be supporting a group of  black actors, writers, and directors. No amount is too small, really. 

Let's Talk Turkey.

NOW, WHEN AND HOW?</h3><p>Mary’s journey started in August 2016 when Guzel, Julia and AC got together to start putting all their ideas on paper. In September same year, the PILOT was successfully shot, which showed it’s possible to aim for a good project with ambitious prospects, even without a budget. The Pilot is in post-production and the five remaining episodes of the first season are currently in production. Season 1 is scheduled to air in fall this year. With only a micro-budget and lots of love, courage and hard work, the show can’t afford to pay cast and crew members the fair amount for their work; however, we do believe in the project and have high hopes (based on a lot of work, research and feedback) that the show can reach a rewarding level of public interest and work as an investment for all, giving us the opportunity to show the industry how qualified we are and lead us to Hollywood’s good grace!</p><h3>THAT'S AWESOME! NOW, WHAT IS THE FIRST SEASON?</h3><p><i>#hsmseason1</i> has 6 episodes of around 10 minutes each. Find, below, a synopsis for each one:</p><p><strong>“PILOT”</strong> Young Idahoan mathematician Mary (Anna-Catharina Mettenheimer) moves to LA to work as a research assistant for a prestigious academic institution. Her first step in the City of Angels is to find a home and a roommate… but that’s no easy task!</p><p><strong>“JESUS“</strong> (S01E02) Settled in her new home and with her new roommate and friend JJ (Hamid Jahangard), Mary faces a second LA must: buy a car. After several failed attempts, Mary meets geeky-witty Mae-Yin (Jolie Chi) and not only ends up buying her car, but also making a new friend. And getting a crush: a very hot bartender named Greg (Conner Floyd).</p><p><strong>“LA GIRL”</strong> (S01E03) Some may say Mary is an LA girl now. And what LA person does not go to the gym? That’s how JJ convinces Mary to join him and his brother Chris (Marcos Favela) on “buddy day” at the gym. Maybe it’s the hot weather, maybe the hot bodies, but in LA going to the gym is more than just work-out clothes and lots of energy!</p><p><strong>“BO WILLIAMS”</strong> (S01E04) It’s party time! Bo Williams, a very famous youtuber, is hosting a big party and the trio finds a way to attend it. Outside her comfort zone, Mary ends up finding out a big secret that can change famous Bo’s entire life. But Bo Williams is not the only one hiding something and JJ and Mae-Yin discover a big secret Mary is keeping about her 5 years relationship with boyfriend Jonathan (Bruce Clifford).</p><p><strong>“THE INTERVENTION”</strong> (S01E05) Half shocked, half outraged, JJ, Mae-Yin and Chris decide to hold an intervention to make Mary realize her relationship with Jonathan is too… outdated for 2017, but Mary is too focused on an upcoming deadline at work to listen to her friends.

It is the story of a young mathematician named Mary as she gets settled in her new life as a research assistant for a prestigious academic institution in Los Angeles, California. Surrounded by the wild, wonderful, and very different City of Angels, alongside her friends JJ, Mae-Yin and Chris, Mary will discover the many layers LA has, but more importantly, she will find herself in the process. #hsmtheshow makes fun of LA with a fresh pair of an outsider’s eyes. WHO?(HOLY) Sh**, Mary! is based on an idea by Anna-Catharina Mettenheimer, who is one of the Executive Producers alongside M. Julia Cancella and Guzel Saitbatalova. Besides running the show, the trio also has production roles: Julia is the screenwriter, AC the lead actress and Guzel the director. The production team is led by Arda Bengü, our beloved and overloaded producer, and Isabel Sega is the witty AD who keeps the set on track.Anna-Catharina MettenheimerAnna-Catharina ""AC"" grew up all over the world including the US, Mexico, Germany and Scotland. AC initially loved to perform as a dancer from a young age, and then got cast in an Oscar Wilde play in seventh grade.

So instead of counting other's people money as a bank clerk, she moved to Los Angeles right after her graduation in 2015. This year, Guzel got an Academic Certificate in Entertainment Studies from UCLA in order to pursue career as a director. Being an executive producer, she directed all of the episodes of the HOLY Sh**, Mary! web-series.

Her next step is to see Nowhere, a coming-of- age feature, launched from the page to the big screen.Arda BenguArda Bengu is a Turkish filmmaker, born and raised in Istanbul. His love of film blossomed early, when a new DVD Rental store opened in his neighborhood. The owner of the store, a family friend, lent Arda an unending supply of DVDs for FREE! as long as he returned one before renting the next. Arda studied science and math in high school, but his cinephilia eventually led him to film school. He graduated from Istanbul BILGI University in 2010 with a bachelor’s degree in Film and Television. Upon graduation, Arda immediately fulfilled his mandatory six month military service. Returning in 2011, he found a job as a camera assistant on a TV series. A year later, he decided to change his career trajectory and became an assistant director. With more than five years of filmmaking experience, Arda has worked on three feature films, four TV series, eight TV commercials and countless short-films. While most of his recent roles were assistant directing, he has also taken various roles in different departments from producing to editing. Over a year ago, Arda changed his life and moved to America. Fate led him to Los Angeles where he earned his certificate degree in Film Producing through the UCLA Extension Program. Arda's next goal is to become the first acclaimed Turkish director based in Hollywood.Carlos SuarezCarlos Suárez is a cinematographer from Caracas, Venezuela, based in Los Angeles, California. He holds a bachelor's degree in Mass Media Communications from the Andrés Bello Catholic University in Caracas.

Carlos has been trained by cinematographers such as Rafael Marziano SVC, Anthony B Richmond ASC BSC, Mike Williamson and Jacek Laskus ASC.Isabel SegaBorn in Maracaibo - Venezuela and known for famous call sheets, Isabel graduated in 2015 from a bachelors in filmmaking. After directing her first feature film Where is Memo she moved to Los Angeles (like everyone else) to pursue her dream of bossing people around on sets. She loves fried plantains and after 10 hours of shooting she usually starts speaking with a fake Italian accent.  GOT IT! NOW, WHEN AND HOW?Mary’s journey started in August 2016 when Guzel, Julia and AC got together to start putting all their ideas on paper. In September same year, the PILOT was successfully shot, which showed it’s possible to aim for a good project with ambitious prospects, even without a budget. The Pilot is in post-production and the five remaining episodes of the first season are currently in production. Season 1 is scheduled to air in fall this year. With only a micro-budget and lots of love, courage and hard work, the show can’t afford to pay cast and crew members the fair amount for their work; however, we do believe in the project and have high hopes (based on a lot of work, research and feedback) that the show can reach a rewarding level of public interest and work as an investment for all, giving us the opportunity to show the industry how qualified we are and lead us to Hollywood’s good grace!THAT'S AWESOME! NOW, WHAT IS THE FIRST SEASON?#hsmseason1 has 6 episodes of around 10 minutes each. Find, below, a synopsis for each one:“PILOT” Young Idahoan mathematician Mary (Anna-Catharina Mettenheimer) moves to LA to work as a research assistant for a prestigious academic institution. Her first step in the City of Angels is to find a home and a roommate… but that’s no easy task!“JESUS“ (S01E02) Settled in her new home and with her new roommate and friend JJ (Hamid Jahangard), Mary faces a second LA must: buy a car. After several failed attempts, Mary meets geeky-witty Mae-Yin (Jolie Chi) and not only ends up buying her car, but also making a new friend. And getting a crush: a very hot bartender named Greg (Conner Floyd).“LA GIRL” (S01E03) Some may say Mary is an LA girl now. And what LA person does not go to the gym? That’s how JJ convinces Mary to join him and his brother Chris (Marcos Favela) on “buddy day” at the gym. Maybe it’s the hot weather, maybe the hot bodies, but in LA going to the gym is more than just work-out clothes and lots of energy!“BO WILLIAMS” (S01E04) It’s party time! Bo Williams, a very famous youtuber, is hosting a big party and the trio finds a way to attend it. Outside her comfort zone, Mary ends up finding out a big secret that can change famous Bo’s entire life. But Bo Williams is not the only one hiding something and JJ and Mae-Yin discover a big secret Mary is keeping about her 5 years relationship with boyfriend Jonathan (Bruce Clifford).“THE INTERVENTION” (S01E05) Half shocked, half outraged, JJ, Mae-Yin and Chris decide to hold an intervention to make Mary realize her relationship with Jonathan is too… outdated for 2017, but Mary is too focused on an upcoming deadline at work to listen to her friends. That’s until she receives a call from Jonathan with some big bad news.“SPACE MARY”(season finale) Devastated and full of brownies, Mary wanders around LA while trying to understand which wrong decisions led her to the bad place she is right now. Surrounded by people, opinions and advice, Mary finally realizes that what she needs is to be brave enough to take the next step. Alone. And so she does…Aren’t you just curious to know what’s gonna happen to Mary on season 2? We are! So let’s get together and make #hsmseason1 happen! We count on each and every one of you!If you love storytelling as much as we do and wish to see our web-series finished up, please consider joining our campaign.

<p>""Cops and Monsters"" is an on-going, award winning supernatural webseries from Scotland. Set in a near-future Scotland, we follow newbies Maya Hedges and Martin Carmichael as they join the Paranormal Investigation Team Scotland (PITS). Series 1 follows their case of Lycan A202, a dangerous werewolf assassin on the run.</p>
<p>The team: made up of upcoming filmmakers and actors, alongside professional, established cast and crew, have shot 9 episodes of Cops and Monsters, which makes up series 1. Now with the final episode in post-production, we are running this small <strong>completion fund campaign</strong> in order to finish the final episode and cover the costs of the following: a full cinema screening for potential distributors, fans, cast, crew, press and industry professionals; a copy of the series 1 DVD and/or blu-ray for all cast and crew; to produce and ship remaining perks for the last campaign and to cover our costs for <strong>MCM Comic Con Scotland </strong>on the 23rd and 24th of September to further promote our show and hopefully raise funds to shoot series 2 in 2018.</p>
<p>We are so extremely grateful for the on-going support and contributions we have received throughout the life of ""Cops and Monsters"" and for all of our episodes so far. We really couldn't do this without you. We have managed to secure some amazing guest stars from Doctor Who (Sophie Aldred, Caitlin Blackwood), Harry Potter (James Payton), Raven (James Mackenzie) and Wolfblood (Rachel Teate and Leona Kate Vaughan) as well as enter the series into festivals around the world, where we have won two awards - including the Best Web Series Award for the Los Angeles Film Festival. </p>

<p>Simple: because there isn't anything like this on British TV at the moment. We've had Torchwood, Being Human, The Fades, Primeval, In the Flesh, MisFits, etc, over the years but sadly they never stay around long enough and at the moment we have nothing like it. So we have created a supernatural police thriller to (hopefully) entertain genre fans, providing them with an exciting story and a group of dynamic characters to support or hate!</p>
<p>We're also doing this so the hard working cast and crew of the show have a chance to build on their experiences while getting paid to do so at the same time! </p>
<p>Hopefully we'll either be picked up by a production company so we can develop the show further with a much bigger budget and resources, or the show will be used as a calling card for all who work on it to progress in their respective careers. It's about creating opportunities. </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
</div><div><p>If we don't hit our goal then we can still finish the final episode but it will take longer to release it and produce our DVDs and remaining perks. We'll also struggle to cover the cost of the cinema hire in August and probably not be able to attend MCM Comic Con Scotland due to their costs for a stall for the 2 day event. We have been really lucky so far and we've been successful in funding each episode of series 1, so we hope this same can be achieved for this completion fund campaign.</p></div><div>

<h3>Short Summary </h3>
<p>I am a sketch comedy writer and actor, working with other comedians and actors to develop a new television show for digital streaming services. Some of my online comedy can be found on Instagram @MonteBellTV and on Youtube: Monte Bell. My ultimate goal is to shine a light on talented people who aren't  given the exposure, benefits or money to make their mark on the world.</p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Joel is a young man from Staten Island trying to keep a roof over his head and evolve his relationship with his girlfriend. His life is immediately changed when he meets Samantha, an heir to a multimillion dollar investment empire, who Joel stops from trying to commit suicide on his watch. After losing his job, Joel is met with a proposal that will financially secure him for the rest of his life, but only if he agrees to date Samantha. Joel struggles with trying to keep his agreement a secret from his girlfriend; as well as trying to keep his two best friends and cousin from getting him into all kinds of day-to-day trouble in light of their discovery of his impending fortune.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need To Get Started</h3>
<p>We are looking for a funding of $45,000 to get our pilot film production rolling.</p>
<p>These donations will be used for the expenses of: Cameras and filming equipment. Lighting and sound equipment. Film and audio editing software. Props and costumes. Filming permits. Cast and crew paperwork. Location rentals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p>The project being filmed is a pilot episode; meaning that there is risk that a network may choose to not pick it up or with all of its original components. However, we are very confident in our project and are aiming at more than one programming network. We expect to be fought over once production is completed. In the unlikelyhood that  the show is not picked up all by one of our targeted providers, it will be formatted into a web series and all contributors will be notified of the change.</p>
<p>Those who contribute will have up to date information about the show's progress. Large contributers will recieve credit as an associate producer once production is finalized.</p>

However, we are very confident in our project and are aiming at more than one programming network. We expect to be fought over once production is completed. In the unlikelyhood that  the show is not picked up all by one of our targeted providers, it will be formatted into a web series and all contributors will be notified of the change.
Those who contribute will have up to date information about the show's progress. Large contributers will recieve credit as an associate producer once production is finalized.

<h3>Here's the Tea</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! I'm Jordyn Boscia, the creator &amp; writer of <strong>End Of Day</strong>, thanks for visiting our page! With the immeasurable help of Matthew Zimmerman, director, and Ean Schultz, director of photography, our team is back and ready to produce another season of <strong>EOD</strong>. After meeting in college, friends that became collaborators began editing scripts, conceptualizing short films, and realizing shared goals - with pizza, beers, and too many Uber rides from Manhattan to Queens #LongDistance</p>
<p>This past spring our team shot and produced <strong>End Of Day: Season 1</strong><i> </i>in New York. The experience we each gained on the ground propelled us to developing another season, while building personal momentums by working on other projects, and once more realizing a shared goal of creating <strong>End Of Day: Season 2.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need Money to be Funny</h3>
<p>Alright sharks, we're looking for $2,500 in order to produce this second season. In return, you'll be able to stream our full season for FREE on YouTube, and anywhere our mothers post on social media #ThanksMoms </p>
<p>Here's a list of what your contribution will help cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location rentals! Our show is about the theatre after all, so we will need to rent rehearsal studio space for shooting</li>
<li>Props! I got rid of my Norton Shakespeare because it was too heavy and well, we'll need another one, among various other items</li>
<li>Food! We'd prefer to not starve the talent</li>
<li>Transportation! We will be traveling to Lawng Eyeland for some shoots and we'd like to cover the cost of the good ole' LI double R train fare</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What This Means to Us</h3>
<p>For the same cost as an oat-milk latte, a happy-hour cocktail, or a single movie ticket, you can take part in the production of our series. We need the support of the community of creatives and viewers we're going to share this work with. Making a personal donation is how you can make an active choice in the kind of content you want to binge-watch while you pound takeout.</p>

<p>Do you ever get the sense that powerful forces are actively working against you and your family, trying to implement an agenda that you don’t agree with?</p>
<p>I sure do, especially since I became a parent. Having kids made me realize just how toxic the culture is for children, and how many dangerous foes they have in the world.</p>
<p>The fact is, we live in an atmosphere in which we are constantly being sold products, taught ideas, and given commands that are bad for our physical, spiritual, psychological, relational, and emotional health. </p>
<p>Becoming a parent also made me aware of just how hard it is to escape these messages and counter this assault. Indeed, it is almost impossible to protect my children from the barrage; in order to do so we would have to live off the grid in a cave somewhere. </p>
<p>That hasn't been a viable option, so instead I have thrown myself into research. Who and what is behind these messages and products? And why do big political and corporate interests seem to push them so strongly? </p>
<p>This project is the result.</p>
<p>It turns out that our sense is correct. There are nefarious forces at work, and there have been for a long time. The history of America is full of greedy and corrupt cultural gatekeepers who have used their money and power for their own gain, while trying to cover up the damage caused to the rest of us. </p>
<p>We'll tell those hidden stores in this documentary-series,<i> American Lies</i>.</p>
<p>In doing so, we will show how Big Media, Big Pharma, Big Government, and Big Philanthropy have used fake science and propaganda to to undermine the Church, destroy the American family, and make us all sick. It's a tale that involves some of the biggest counterfeits, cons, and cover-ups in United States history. </p>
<p><i>​--------------------------</i></p>
<h3><i>""In doing so we will show how Big Media, Big Pharma, Big Government, and Big Philanthropy  have used fake science and propaganda to undermine the Church, destroy the American family, and make us all sick. It's a tale that involves some of the biggest counterfeits, cons, and cover-ups in United States history.""</i></h3>
<p><i>--------------------------</i></p>
<p>For example, we’ll look at the truth behind some of the people our history books set up as ""heroes,” such as Alfred Kinsey, Margaret Mead, Hugh Hefner, and Helen Gurley Brown, as well as philanthropists such as such as the the Rockefellers, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet.</p>
<p>We’ll examine pharmaceutical companies such as Merck and Searle, as well as the abortion giant Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>And as we do we’ll see the extent to which these organizations and private individuals have made use of media propaganda and government corruption to further their nefarious ends.</p>
<p>Ends that include undermining Christianity, breaking apart the traditional family, selling us drugs they knew were harmful, and, of course, actually getting rid of large portions of the human population.  </p>
<p>We are not a healthy society. But the fact is, it's not entirely our fault. We’ve been sold a pack of lies, and as the truth is known, we can turn it around and put things right again. </p>
<p>Please join me as we try to accomplish one small part of that task, and let’s get this series made. </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>Potential Episode List</h2>
<p>Here is the list of topics and stories we hope to cover in this series. They all involve lies that have kept us from living a flourishing, healthy life. (Some of these are fairly broad, so the coverage of any of the following may involve telling several smaller stories within the larger topic.) </p>
<p><strong>The Fake Scientists</strong>: Much of the sexual revolution was sold as ""scientific."" Researchers such Margaret Mead (C<i>oming of Age in Samoa</i>), Alfred Kinsey (<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i> and <i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</i>), and Larry Lader (<i>Abortion</i>) provided the supposedly objective facts that undergirded the arguments of the sexual revolutionaries such as Betty Friedan and led to decisions such as Roe v. Wade. However, the studies were all flawed, and often downright false. We'll tell several stories in this category. </p>

</ul>
<p><strong>The Fake News Industry: </strong>Is it even possible to find objective news content anymore? Or is it all propaganda?</p>

<p><strong>Pleasure, Inc</strong>.: We'll look into the toxic relationship between certain companies in media, science, and pharmaceuticals to expose the lie that the hook-up culture is harmless and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Mature Audiences</strong>: Big pornography is widely accepted to be harmless adult entertainment. Here is story behind that lie.</p>
<p><strong>The Divorce Industrial Complex</strong>: Kids are resilient and divorce is not a big deal, right? False.</p>
<p><strong>The Meaning of Love</strong>: Where did we get the idea that marriage is whatever you want it to be? It wasn't from anything based in objective reality.</p>
<p><strong>Made This Way</strong>: Where did we get the idea that gender and sexual orientation are whatever you want it to be? </p>
<p><strong>Choice or Child?</strong>:  The story behind the widespread acceptance abortion is one of outright deceit and propaganda.</p>
<p><strong>The Hidden Consequences of the Pill</strong>: The contraceptive pill has been a disaster for women, psychologically, emotionally, economically, and physically. We'll tell that story, showing how the pill has led to everything from from depression to cancer.</p>
<p><strong>On the Cover</strong>: The most popular career goal among young people today is to be famous. Not famous for being good at something, just famous.  How did it come to this?</p>
<p><strong>Scam U.</strong>: The corruption on college campuses is out of control. Here's the story they don't want you know. </p>
<p><strong>Little Big Leagues</strong>: For hundreds of thousands of American kids, childhood now consists of what is essentially full time pro-style sports (or other scheduled extracurricular activities). Is this really what it takes to be fulfilled, and how did we come to believe that it is? </p>
<p><strong>A Tough Commute</strong>: The story of how the suburbs came to be seen as the pinnacle of the American Dream. </p>
<p><strong>No Alternative</strong>: The story of how Rockefeller and his descendants in Big Pharma destroyed the natural medicine industry and have lied to us about what it takes to stay healthy and cure disease.</p>
<p><strong>Got Marketing?</strong>:  How food producers convinced us that consuming mass quantities of [insert food product here] is good for you, even when it isn't. (Also applies to products such as tobacco.)</p>
<p><strong>Vaccine Chaos</strong>: The mass inoculation and immunization of the population for everything from mumps to HPV has had a boatload of buried consequences, often literally. There is a reason the government has paid out billions in damages; we'll uncover many of the hidden truths.</p>

<p><strong>Color Blind</strong>: Where did some folks get the idea that America’s race problem has essentially been solved?</p>

<p><strong>With Liberty and Justice for Some</strong>: America is supposed to be fair. Our examination of the justice system will show you how far it is from its name.</p>
<p><strong>Fake Faiths</strong>: The story behind some of the biggest religious hoaxes in American history, including the backstory on Scientology.</p>
<p><strong>The Health and Wealth Gospe</strong>l: The most popular theological trend in America is the belief that Jesus wants us to be rich. This is the story of how American Christianity flipped Jesus's gospel on its head. </p>
<p><strong>Hyperpluralism</strong>: We'll dig into American religious history to examine the idea that every religion is equal and that it doesn't matter where a particular faith came from.</p>
<p><strong>When We All Get to Heaven</strong>: Where did we get the idea that everyone ends up in eternal bliss, no matter what kind of life they have lived?</p>

<h2>The Budget</h2>
<p>Right now we are just trying to raise enough money to get the first few episodes done; we know that these are tough economic times for many people. However, we also feel that in these times, getting the truth out is more important than ever, and that if we can get an some episodes done, that there will be plenty of momentum to keep getting them produced.</p>
</div><div><h2>Other Ways to Help</h2></div><div>

</div></div>","Do you ever get the sense that powerful forces are actively working against you and your family, trying to implement an agenda that you don’t agree with?
I sure do, especially since I became a parent. Having kids made me realize just how toxic the culture is for children, and how many dangerous foes they have in the world.
The fact is, we live in an atmosphere in which we are constantly being sold products, taught ideas, and given commands that are bad for our physical, spiritual, psychological, relational, and emotional health. 
Becoming a parent also made me aware of just how hard it is to escape these messages and counter this assault. Indeed, it is almost impossible to protect my children from the barrage; in order to do so we would have to live off the grid in a cave somewhere. 
That hasn't been a viable option, so instead I have thrown myself into research. Who and what is behind these messages and products? And why do big political and corporate interests seem to push them so strongly? 
This project is the result.
It turns out that our sense is correct. There are nefarious forces at work, and there have been for a long time. The history of America is full of greedy and corrupt cultural gatekeepers who have used their money and power for their own gain, while trying to cover up the damage caused to the rest of us. 
We'll tell those hidden stores in this documentary-series, American Lies.
In doing so, we will show how Big Media, Big Pharma, Big Government, and Big Philanthropy have used fake science and propaganda to to undermine the Church, destroy the American family, and make us all sick. It's a tale that involves some of the biggest counterfeits, cons, and cover-ups in United States history.

""In doing so we will show how Big Media, Big Pharma, Big Government, and Big Philanthropy  have used fake science and propaganda to undermine the Church, destroy the American family, and make us all sick. It's a tale that involves some of the biggest counterfeits, cons, and cover-ups in United States history.""
--------------------------
For example, we’ll look at the truth behind some of the people our history books set up as ""heroes,” such as Alfred Kinsey, Margaret Mead, Hugh Hefner, and Helen Gurley Brown, as well as philanthropists such as such as the the Rockefellers, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet.
We’ll examine pharmaceutical companies such as Merck and Searle, as well as the abortion giant Planned Parenthood.
And as we do we’ll see the extent to which these organizations and private individuals have made use of media propaganda and government corruption to further their nefarious ends.
Ends that include undermining Christianity, breaking apart the traditional family, selling us drugs they knew were harmful, and, of course, actually getting rid of large portions of the human population.  
We are not a healthy society. But the fact is, it's not entirely our fault. We’ve been sold a pack of lies, and as the truth is known, we can turn it around and put things right again. 
Please join me as we try to accomplish one small part of that task, and let’s get this series made. 
Thank you,

Here is a clip from Unprotected to give you a feel for the kind of stories we like to tell.
 

 
Potential Episode List
Here is the list of topics and stories we hope to cover in this series. They all involve lies that have kept us from living a flourishing, healthy life. (Some of these are fairly broad, so the coverage of any of the following may involve telling several smaller stories within the larger topic.) 
The Fake Scientists: Much of the sexual revolution was sold as ""scientific."" Researchers such Margaret Mead (Coming of Age in Samoa), Alfred Kinsey (Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female), and Larry Lader (Abortion) provided the supposedly objective facts that undergirded the arguments of the sexual revolutionaries such as Betty Friedan and led to decisions such as Roe v. Wade. However, the studies were all flawed, and often downright false. We'll tell several stories in this category.

The Fake News Industry: Is it even possible to find objective news content anymore? Or is it all propaganda?
Click here to listen to The Master Manipulator (The Story of Edward Bernays) on the American Lies Podcast
Pleasure, Inc.: We'll look into the toxic relationship between certain companies in media, science, and pharmaceuticals to expose the lie that the hook-up culture is harmless and enjoyable for everyone.
Mature Audiences: Big pornography is widely accepted to be harmless adult entertainment. Here is story behind that lie.
The Divorce Industrial Complex: Kids are resilient and divorce is not a big deal, right? False.
The Meaning of Love: Where did we get the idea that marriage is whatever you want it to be? It wasn't from anything based in objective reality.
Made This Way: Where did we get the idea that gender and sexual orientation are whatever you want it to be? 
Choice or Child?:  The story behind the widespread acceptance abortion is one of outright deceit and propaganda.
The Hidden Consequences of the Pill: The contraceptive pill has been a disaster for women, psychologically, emotionally, economically, and physically. We'll tell that story, showing how the pill has led to everything from from depression to cancer.
On the Cover: The most popular career goal among young people today is to be famous. Not famous for being good at something, just famous.  How did it come to this?
Scam U.: The corruption on college campuses is out of control. Here's the story they don't want you know. 
Little Big Leagues: For hundreds of thousands of American kids, childhood now consists of what is essentially full time pro-style sports (or other scheduled extracurricular activities). Is this really what it takes to be fulfilled, and how did we come to believe that it is? 
A Tough Commute: The story of how the suburbs came to be seen as the pinnacle of the American Dream. 
No Alternative: The story of how Rockefeller and his descendants in Big Pharma destroyed the natural medicine industry and have lied to us about what it takes to stay healthy and cure disease.
Got Marketing?:  How food producers convinced us that consuming mass quantities of [insert food product here] is good for you, even when it isn't. (Also applies to products such as tobacco.)
Vaccine Chaos: The mass inoculation and immunization of the population for everything from mumps to HPV has had a boatload of buried consequences, often literally. There is a reason the government has paid out billions in damages; we'll uncover many of the hidden truths.

With Liberty and Justice for Some: America is supposed to be fair. Our examination of the justice system will show you how far it is from its name.
Fake Faiths: The story behind some of the biggest religious hoaxes in American history, including the backstory on Scientology.
The Health and Wealth Gospel: The most popular theological trend in America is the belief that Jesus wants us to be rich. This is the story of how American Christianity flipped Jesus's gospel on its head. 
Hyperpluralism: We'll dig into American religious history to examine the idea that every religion is equal and that it doesn't matter where a particular faith came from.
When We All Get to Heaven: Where did we get the idea that everyone ends up in eternal bliss, no matter what kind of life they have lived?

The Budget
Right now we are just trying to raise enough money to get the first few episodes done; we know that these are tough economic times for many people. However, we also feel that in these times, getting the truth out is more important than ever, and that if we can get an some episodes done, that there will be plenty of momentum to keep getting them produced.

<h3>Series Overview</h3>
<p>Executive produced by <a href=""https://www.blmcle.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Lives Matter Cleveland</a>, this documentary series will showcase the systemic failures of Ohio law enforcement across the state—one city at a time. The initial four-episode season explores police abuse in the city of Euclid, Ohio.  </p>

<p>The third episode will examine the racist roots of Euclid’s city government and policing in the context of the present-day experiences of young people of color living in the majority Black suburb. </p>
<p>The season concludes with a thorough examination of what is and is not included in Euclid’s police training. In 2018, evidence of internal police training that made light of use of force was exposed in a lawsuit filed by the Stewart family. This documentary will reveal for the first time that in 2017 Euclid police hired the training services of controversial <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2021/01/22/warrior-training-police-killology-orig-mg.cnn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Killology” expert, Lt.

<p>The aggressive training that Euclid officers received was only half of the problem, though.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Police corruption and violence towards Ohio’s Black and minority residents is an epidemic that needs to see the light of day.  Local news has largely failed to report on these issues adequately or without a pro-cop spin.  Our research lays it bare, warts and all, and challenges audiences to look at the true nature of an inherently racist institution.</li>

<li>We delayed this funding campaign until we had an episode that is completely finished and displays the quality and integrity we plan to bring to all episodes of State of Injustice, it’s already real and has great potential for growth depending on the success of this campaign.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We’ve mitigated some of your risk simply by waiting until we had a sample of a finished product to show, but there are always risks and challenges to overcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve developed a team that has a track record of finishing what we start.  As experienced filmmakers, journalists and activists we know that the next challenge is always right around the bend. Fortunately our shared experiences have equipped us with the fortitude to overcome these challenges.</li>
<li>While our team is capable and talented we are currently stretched a bit thin, which is why we are always on the lookout for new blood to bring onto the project.  Ideally this series will employ a variety of directors, producers, editors and camera operators working together to produce gripping exposés of police injustice across the state of Ohio and regions around the country.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We want this campaign to go viral.  Our reporting has already exposed issues that have NEVER been reported on in mainstream news.  We have our fingers on the pulse of police corruption here in our state and need folks like you to help us amplify this message.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the campaign on social media using Indiegogo’s share tools.</li>
<li>Volunteer to contribute to future episodes by reaching out to us.</li>
<li>Send us your hot tips of corruption in your town or city.</li>
</ul>
<p>It takes a village to fight for justice.  We want you to join our struggle.</p>

Series Overview
Executive produced by Black Lives Matter Cleveland, this documentary series will showcase the systemic failures of Ohio law enforcement across the state—one city at a time. The initial four-episode season explores police abuse in the city of Euclid, Ohio.  
Episode 1 is already complete and lays out the style and journalistic integrity which will define this project.  Episodes 2 – 4 are in various stages of post-production, with episode 2 slated for release in the final week of the campaign.
Season one thesis statement:
The culture of the Euclid police department is toxic both to the community it ostensibly serves and to the police officers who are shaped by it.

We are introduced to the STATE OF INJUSTICE series via a thorough investigation into the case of Luke Stewart, a young Black man who was killed by Euclid police shortly after being woken up in his parked car.

Episode two will be released on the eve of the fourth anniversary of Stewart’s killing, March 12th at 7pm, as a livestream screening and panel discussion. This installment exposes the commonality of aggressive tactics used by its majority White officers towards Black residents, as evidenced by the beatings of Lamar Wright and Richard Hubbard III.

The third episode will examine the racist roots of Euclid’s city government and policing in the context of the present-day experiences of young people of color living in the majority Black suburb.

The aggressive training that Euclid officers received was only half of the problem, though. The final episode will also highlight the legal research and analysis conducted by Mariah Crenshaw of Chasing Justice, LLC. Crenshaw’s investigation reveals a disturbing pattern of non-compliance with state training requirements for officers both in Euclid and in police departments across the state.
Any and all additional funds will be put towards the production of season 2 as we move just south of Euclid to examine some incredible examples of corruption and violent policing in the embattled city of East Cleveland. 

What We Need & What You Get
Our target is what we need to raise to complete season one within four months of the launch of this campaign. We are not beholden to corporate advertising dollars, which allows us to maintain our journalistic integrity. 
Up until now the filmmakers have donated their time shooting interviews and doing deep-dive research into the issues plaguing Euclid and other cities' police departments across the state.
Now we need funds earmarked for post-production to complete season one, create our interactive website and build a model for future episodes and seasons.  Sadly, there is no shortage of stories of police misconduct to report on. 
10% of all funds raised will go directly to Black Lives Matter Cleveland to support the important work they are doing in the community.  We aim to partner with BLM chapters around the state and the country for future episodes and seasons of STATE OF INJUSTICE.

Director Roger Glenn Hill is an award-winning filmmaker (Huckleberry (2018), Flying Paper (2014) and Struggle (2012)) Journalist Brian “BZ” Douglas has—in a short time—delivered scoops on corruption in Cleveland politics and police that have rippled all the way to the New York Times.  Black Lives Matter Cleveland has roots in the community and they have been at the frontlines of social change both in Cleveland and the state as a whole.
We delayed this funding campaign until we had an episode that is completely finished and displays the quality and integrity we plan to bring to all episodes of State of Injustice, it’s already real and has great potential for growth depending on the success of this campaign.


Risks & Challenges
We’ve mitigated some of your risk simply by waiting until we had a sample of a finished product to show, but there are always risks and challenges to overcome.

We’ve developed a team that has a track record of finishing what we start.  As experienced filmmakers, journalists and activists we know that the next challenge is always right around the bend. Fortunately our shared experiences have equipped us with the fortitude to overcome these challenges.
While our team is capable and talented we are currently stretched a bit thin, which is why we are always on the lookout for new blood to bring onto the project.  Ideally this series will employ a variety of directors, producers, editors and camera operators working together to produce gripping exposés of police injustice across the state of Ohio and regions around the country.


Other Ways You Can Help
We want this campaign to go viral.  Our reporting has already exposed issues that have NEVER been reported on in mainstream news.  We have our fingers on the pulse of police corruption here in our state and need folks like you to help us amplify this message.

Share the campaign on social media using Indiegogo’s share tools.
Volunteer to contribute to future episodes by reaching out to us.
Send us your hot tips of corruption in your town or city.

It takes a village to fight for justice.  We want you to join our struggle.",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is <a href=""https://www.thekings.show/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Kings</a>?</h3>
<p>     ""The Kings"" is a dramedic (dramatic+comedic) original series that looks to redefine what it means to be Asian-American by starring two as compelling American leads. Seemingly every show or movie with an Asian character has focused on some part of their Eastern origins - whether it be through accent, cultural ties, or stereotypes. With ""The Kings,"" we want to show that Asian-Americans are... Americans. Period.</p>
<p>     We are more than our good grades. We are more than our laundromats and dry-cleaners. We are artists and dancers and poets and lovers and athletes and painters and musicians and some of us have perfect American accents and some of us, admittedly, are poor drivers, but others are not, and all of us are more than the sum of these stereotypes. We and so many others cannot wait to express ourselves. To reveal to you our hearts and our souls. To live and laugh and love and die on the screen and the stage. Now is only the beginning.      <i>  </i></p>

<h3>What is the money for? </h3>
<p>GOAL: $20K for 3 episodes (half-season)</p>
<p>STRETCH GOAL: $40K for 6 episodes (full-season)</p>
<p>     We have 6 episodes comprising Season 1 that we cannot wait to show you! But first, filming them is going to be expensive. While we're not making the next Mission Impossible (yet), the cost for quality work is high, and we are more than willing to invest for it.</p>
<p>     Your donations will help fund camera and equipment rentals, location/music/parking permits, our crew's wages, insurance, hair and makeup, sound, wardrobe, FOOD (sorry, caps), art design, post-production, and the actors! We have a wonderful cast and crew and want to thank them with more than just words - they deserve it. It's also important to us that we have zero wage gap between actors and actresses. Talent's pay will be determined on level of billing (extra, co-star, guest-star, series regular).</p>
<p>     I (chriskingwong) will not be accepting payment. This is my passion project - my goal is to get ""The Kings"" outside investing, into prestigious film festivals, and (hopefully) picked up. I'll gladly forego any daily rate to make that a reality. Part of production is saving all the money we can. The other is investing in top-tier cast, crew, and equipment. </p>
<p>     Getting more granular on budget breakdowns is tough since every episode will range drastically in terms of required equipment, crew, and cast. Each episode is approx. 10-15 mins. long and we've estimated that a ~$7K budget per episode will be about the average required to film. What we CAN do is provide updates as we go into pre-production for our season and give inside scoops into what we're planning, how we're approaching, and an estimated timeline of deliverables. So much of this will be contingent on how much we raise - the more we receive, the more options we have available.</p>
<p>     We will be updating all of our backers throughout the duration of the campaign, immediately after it ends, and on regular time intervals thereafter (probably monthly). We don't want this to be a one-sided endeavor, so please share your feedback - this is a journey that we want all of you to take with us!</p>

There would be little point in making something that nobody watches, but the traffic on our website alone and the likes on our Facebook page, the comments and the re-tweets seem to have shown that indeed, we do have an audience out there and that we are working for them.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526887615/erhwdwicrnvs3xnv9wto.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>By getting involved in our fund-raising campaign, you have the chance to make sure we continue to bring interesting stories set in Cardiff to a worldwide audience. You will help us gain access to more resources through your financial support, and you will allow us to expand our team to better address the nature of these new and more complex scripts. Already we have designed a new website for the show, and a new logo too. That all came about because of previous investment from some of our closest friends, and their belief in us has been so greatly appreciated. By investing in our series two campaign, you too will ensure that the ""Anoraks"" legacy continues.</p><p><strong>So what does Series Two look like so far?</strong></p><p>As of the start of this campaign, we have written nine of the ten episodes and each episode will run approximately fifteen minutes in length, (which is more than most web series). Our initial intention to produce tight, quippy, and somewhat sarcastic 5-minute episodes failed as soon as series one began. Instead, we realised that our characters have a scope that not only should be explored but lives that needed to be explored. While comedy remains our first priority, we have also found that drama works incredibly well in our episodes too. How can you sustain the happy times without the bad times to give the happy times meaning? </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526978239/ha09venywaxsvtnodaca.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><br/>One thing in series one that we weren’t entirely satisfied with, was filming the convention episode. Facing other people's very tight schedules and commitments, and then filming guerrilla-style at a live event was indeed extremely tough, though we still very much appreciate everyone who helped us out and the willingness of the convention organisers and the hotel to aid us in any way. This year's batch of episodes once again crosses paths with a convention and instead of us showing up on the doorstep of an existing event, we have decided after much deliberation, to hold a one-day mini-event ourselves, so we can have some control over the schedule and allow time for our special guest stars to participate in filming. We've tentatively called it ""NerdFest2018"" and one of the contributor's perks to our fund-raising campaign is the chance to not only attend the event but to also attend a special cocktail party and meet our guests, the cast and crew!</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Boik3NHCHuY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p><br/>Other perks include the opportunity to actually be in an episode - yes, we've written two small but surprisingly integral roles especially for contributors.  Other perks are signed shooting scripts of series one and two, specially pressed DVDs of the first and second series and exclusive merchandise including T-shirts, magnets and badges - this is a one-time chance for contributors to get in on the ground level and also bag one-of-a-kind collectables!</p><p>The last time we held a fund-raiser, we set a target goal and we nearly achieved it - we reached 92% funded. But because we also stipulated that the campaign was all-or-nothing, we sadly, ended up with nothing. This time, we've decided to hold an open fund-raiser. Our ambitious target of £9000 would be ideal to see this second series through by covering all our expenses and paying everyone in full to participate.   So, if we meet our goal this year, then series two will be like a well-oiled machine.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526978317/slt9ee5u24d4rma2crly.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>While the budget has been more concisely written, here is what we've basically allocated to each item line:</p><p>Main cast: £4000</p><p>Guest cast: £2500</p><p>Crew: £2000</p><p>Location expenses/permits: £400</p><p>Catering:  £100</p><p>The above total is very little if you think about shooting ten episodes and their associated rehearsal times, but this is what the campaign is aiming for. We've already decided to pay out of pocket for some item lines that you don't see here but that include: rehearsal space rental, rehearsal pay for the actors, a script supervisor, additional filming equipment, office supplies, additional catering, additional transportation. We also hope that by putting on a mini-con, we can raise funds to not only pay for the event itself, but also help offset any of our additional costs.</p><p><strong>Why is your contribution so important to us?</strong></p><p>We are not making television, we are making a web series. While doing so is quite freeing in terms of the lack of corporate creative control or other issues, what is most prominent is the lack of funding available to creative film-makers who engage with a web-based product. We have no access to license fees or broadcast funds, and we certainly have no access to arts council or film council funds because of the very nature of our project. Any help comes down to you, the audience.</p><p>Often geek and nerd culture has been used for easy laughs in the media, so this is an opportunity to own our world. Whether your geek poison of choice is Doctor Who, Marvel or Harry Potter, the culture of fandom and it's politics is a rich mine of comedy gold! As fans ourselves, what we want to do with ""Anoraks"" is to show to the world how warm and funny, but also how complicated such fan communities are and can be. What is it that drives a fan? What motivates someone to spend all their money and give all their time over to cult television shows and films? Can the same be said of sports fans or of music fans? Sure it can.

We hope you feel the same about our project.</p><p> </p></div>","What is ""Anoraks"" anyway?A few years ago, we created the nerd web sitcom ""Anoraks"".  It is an affectionate look at sci-fi fans and fandom (at first, it was mainly Doctor Who, but we explore other types of television and movie franchises as well). As a creative team, we are all fans ourselves, so have first-hand knowledge of how warm, passionate, and often-times how ridiculous and obsessed fandom can be!The creative team consists of Darren Floyd as head writer and series creator, (writer of three published novels and former head of an award winning horror publishing company), Ed Sinclair (award-winning documentary director) as director and co-writer, and Sian Floyd as producer. Through a combination of people’s generosity and talent, we managed to produce the first season of ten episodes, (each between 5 and 14 minutes), on a serious micro-budget where much of the financial investment came from ourselves and a handful of our wonderful friends.The biggest news this year is the addition of a new cast member in the form of acclaimed stand-up comedian, Lorna Prichard, who will bring a new and younger voice to the Anorak's worlds of fandom.  With series two already feeling more expansive, more references to the wider SF and Fantasy worlds and we've also included a host of new secondary characters, and more guest stars dependant upon a bigger budget, so that we can attract professional cast and crew, and shockingly, pay them! Your contribution will help us achieve our goal of producing a truly high-quality product. If you have already seen some of series one's episodes, then you know that we have tried to make broadcast type of stories on less than a shoe-string budget.  Our team is mostly made up of experienced professionals who have come together to make something that they all find exciting, refreshing, challenging and worthwhile. There would be little point in making something that nobody watches, but the traffic on our website alone and the likes on our Facebook page, the comments and the re-tweets seem to have shown that indeed, we do have an audience out there and that we are working for them.By getting involved in our fund-raising campaign, you have the chance to make sure we continue to bring interesting stories set in Cardiff to a worldwide audience. You will help us gain access to more resources through your financial support, and you will allow us to expand our team to better address the nature of these new and more complex scripts. Already we have designed a new website for the show, and a new logo too. That all came about because of previous investment from some of our closest friends, and their belief in us has been so greatly appreciated. By investing in our series two campaign, you too will ensure that the ""Anoraks"" legacy continues.So what does Series Two look like so far?As of the start of this campaign, we have written nine of the ten episodes and each episode will run approximately fifteen minutes in length, (which is more than most web series). Our initial intention to produce tight, quippy, and somewhat sarcastic 5-minute episodes failed as soon as series one began. Instead, we realised that our characters have a scope that not only should be explored but lives that needed to be explored. While comedy remains our first priority, we have also found that drama works incredibly well in our episodes too. How can you sustain the happy times without the bad times to give the happy times meaning? One thing in series one that we weren’t entirely satisfied with, was filming the convention episode. Facing other people's very tight schedules and commitments, and then filming guerrilla-style at a live event was indeed extremely tough, though we still very much appreciate everyone who helped us out and the willingness of the convention organisers and the hotel to aid us in any way. This year's batch of episodes once again crosses paths with a convention and instead of us showing up on the doorstep of an existing event, we have decided after much deliberation, to hold a one-day mini-event ourselves, so we can have some control over the schedule and allow time for our special guest stars to participate in filming. We've tentatively called it ""NerdFest2018"" and one of the contributor's perks to our fund-raising campaign is the chance to not only attend the event but to also attend a special cocktail party and meet our guests, the cast and crew!Other perks include the opportunity to actually be in an episode - yes, we've written two small but surprisingly integral roles especially for contributors.  Other perks are signed shooting scripts of series one and two, specially pressed DVDs of the first and second series and exclusive merchandise including T-shirts, magnets and badges - this is a one-time chance for contributors to get in on the ground level and also bag one-of-a-kind collectables!The last time we held a fund-raiser, we set a target goal and we nearly achieved it - we reached 92% funded. But because we also stipulated that the campaign was all-or-nothing, we sadly, ended up with nothing. This time, we've decided to hold an open fund-raiser. Our ambitious target of £9000 would be ideal to see this second series through by covering all our expenses and paying everyone in full to participate.   So, if we meet our goal this year, then series two will be like a well-oiled machine.While the budget has been more concisely written, here is what we've basically allocated to each item line:Main cast: £4000Guest cast: £2500Crew: £2000Location expenses/permits: £400Catering:  £100The above total is very little if you think about shooting ten episodes and their associated rehearsal times, but this is what the campaign is aiming for. We've already decided to pay out of pocket for some item lines that you don't see here but that include: rehearsal space rental, rehearsal pay for the actors, a script supervisor, additional filming equipment, office supplies, additional catering, additional transportation. We also hope that by putting on a mini-con, we can raise funds to not only pay for the event itself, but also help offset any of our additional costs.Why is your contribution so important to us?We are not making television, we are making a web series. While doing so is quite freeing in terms of the lack of corporate creative control or other issues, what is most prominent is the lack of funding available to creative film-makers who engage with a web-based product. We have no access to license fees or broadcast funds, and we certainly have no access to arts council or film council funds because of the very nature of our project. Any help comes down to you, the audience.Often geek and nerd culture has been used for easy laughs in the media, so this is an opportunity to own our world. Whether your geek poison of choice is Doctor Who, Marvel or Harry Potter, the culture of fandom and it's politics is a rich mine of comedy gold! As fans ourselves, what we want to do with ""Anoraks"" is to show to the world how warm and funny, but also how complicated such fan communities are and can be. What is it that drives a fan? What motivates someone to spend all their money and give all their time over to cult television shows and films? Can the same be said of sports fans or of music fans? Sure it can. And ""Anoraks"" is a self-reflexive look at not only the world of geek fandom, but also how it touches on those other worlds when sometimes those worlds collide (see what we did there?

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>My name is Kwaku El, I'm a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a BYU student, and a lover film, television, and italian sodas.</p>
<p>For the past two and a half years I've hosted a small talkshow called ""Saints Unscripted"" (formerly known as 3 Mormons) and it's been amazing! This was the first weekly Latter-day Saint talkshow by young people, for everyone. </p>
<p>The show got a lot of criticism, and then a huge amount of praise. It was different than anything our culture has done before. People kept telling us how much they wanted more gospel centered media online. Mothers and Fathers excited that their children can go on youtube, and watch videos about the gospel, that don't feel like church. </p>
<p>It made me realize we need more. We need more vlogs, sketches, interviews, music, short films, and devotionals made by young people, about the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We need to use media in a relevant way; and it starts now!</p>
<p>The project will begin with one channel, and by February 2019, two active channels will be producing content. This campaign is the one to get us all going!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Quality &amp; Advertising are the MOST important parts of a media channel. We want each video to be high quality in regards to video, audio, writing, and editing. In today's incredibly competitive independent media world, only well made videos gain traction. The money used will go to the following:</p>
<p><strong>Blackmagic URSA mini &amp; Camera Lenses</strong></p>
<p><strong>Studio Lights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tripod, batteries, and other necessities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adobe Premiere Subscription </strong></p>
<p><strong>Advertisement </strong></p>
<p><strong>Payment to editors </strong></p>
<p><b>&amp; More!</b></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is valuable due to the urgency of gospel centered content online. Content that can be as engaging and entertaining as secular media, but more hopeful, insightful, and spiritual.</p>
<p>Teenagers, young adults, and investigators often want to watch gospel centered media. Yet often times our church culture produces content that members call too serious, and too broad. With this new project we will be preaching the gospel in ways that keep people engaged, excited, and informed, while not feeling like Church. The amount of lives this could change is endless. The amount of seeds planted will be endless.</p>
<p>In 2018, media can be very hostile toward the church.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Challenge #1- Lack of exposure. <br/>One of the most difficult issues to overcome with media channels is the lack of exposure. With the budget we are seeking for, we will be able to advertise our way out of obscurity and gain momentum.</p>
<p>Challenge #2- Quality.<br/>To have a successful media platform today, high quality is a necessity. The majority of our budget will be for the necessary equipment.</p>
<p>Challenge #3- Discipleship.<br/>It's important to get christlike media at the forefront of attention, however we don't want to lose the message for popularity. Using President Kimball's 1977 Devotional, ""The Gospel Vision of the Arts"" as a foundation, we are confident in our ability to hold artistic integrity, use media literacy, and hold firm in the bounds of discipleship.</p>

</div></div>","Why
My name is Kwaku El, I'm a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a BYU student, and a lover film, television, and italian sodas.
For the past two and a half years I've hosted a small talkshow called ""Saints Unscripted"" (formerly known as 3 Mormons) and it's been amazing! This was the first weekly Latter-day Saint talkshow by young people, for everyone. 
The show got a lot of criticism, and then a huge amount of praise. It was different than anything our culture has done before. People kept telling us how much they wanted more gospel centered media online. Mothers and Fathers excited that their children can go on youtube, and watch videos about the gospel, that don't feel like church. 
It made me realize we need more. We need more vlogs, sketches, interviews, music, short films, and devotionals made by young people, about the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We need to use media in a relevant way; and it starts now!
The project will begin with one channel, and by February 2019, two active channels will be producing content. This campaign is the one to get us all going!

What We Need
Quality & Advertising are the MOST important parts of a media channel. We want each video to be high quality in regards to video, audio, writing, and editing. In today's incredibly competitive independent media world, only well made videos gain traction. The money used will go to the following:
Blackmagic URSA mini & Camera Lenses
Studio Lights
Tripod, batteries, and other necessities
Adobe Premiere Subscription 
Advertisement 
Payment to editors 
& More!

The Impact
This project is valuable due to the urgency of gospel centered content online. Content that can be as engaging and entertaining as secular media, but more hopeful, insightful, and spiritual.
Teenagers, young adults, and investigators often want to watch gospel centered media. Yet often times our church culture produces content that members call too serious, and too broad. With this new project we will be preaching the gospel in ways that keep people engaged, excited, and informed, while not feeling like Church. The amount of lives this could change is endless. The amount of seeds planted will be endless.
In 2018, media can be very hostile toward the church. People often misrepresent our doctrine, belittle our leaders, and throw different forms of prejudice our way; hoping to frighten investigators and damage testimonies. This channel will be a way to fight against that by reclaiming the narrative, and proudly stating our beliefs in a remarkable way.

Risks & Challenges
Challenge #1- Lack of exposure. One of the most difficult issues to overcome with media channels is the lack of exposure. With the budget we are seeking for, we will be able to advertise our way out of obscurity and gain momentum.
Challenge #2- Quality.To have a successful media platform today, high quality is a necessity. The majority of our budget will be for the necessary equipment.
Challenge #3- Discipleship.It's important to get christlike media at the forefront of attention, however we don't want to lose the message for popularity. Using President Kimball's 1977 Devotional, ""The Gospel Vision of the Arts"" as a foundation, we are confident in our ability to hold artistic integrity, use media literacy, and hold firm in the bounds of discipleship.

<h3>First, what we do:</h3>
<p>We (Tanner, Eric, and Nico) currently produce a storytelling podcast called the Legends Myths and Whiskey podcast. During each 60-90 minute episode we do three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell two stories, each from different cultures.</li>
<li>Discuss those stories and everything they make us think or feel.</li>
<li>Taste and review a whiskey throughout the duration.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, our own in-house composer, Nico Vettese, creates original scores for each story. These scores are painstakingly produced to match the culture from which their stories originate; that includes the use of culture-specific instruments.</p>
<p><strong>There are a lot of example on our Bandcamp page</strong>, here are fourteen of them: <a href=""https://lmaw.bandcamp.com/album/stories-iii"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://lmaw.bandcamp.com/album/stories-iii</a></p>
<p><strong>We also create Mythosymphonies</strong>, which are like audiobooks with full musical scores and which focus on a particular culture's full pantheon or maybe one well-known story. Two examples are our <a href=""https://lmaw.bandcamp.com/album/beowulf-a-mythosymphony"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beowulf Mythosymphony</a> and our <a href=""https://lmaw.bandcamp.com/album/japan-a-mythosymphony"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Japan Mythosymphony</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We do what we do with a single goal in mind</strong>: <i>Understanding leads to appreciation which leads to tolerance</i>. We share stories from all over the world and all across history, and we do it because we want people to understand themselves and each other better. We're all different and we have different histories, but all of those histories are rich and interesting and if we can learn to appreciate our own and others, the world could be a better place.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need and what you get:</h3>
<p>We need $20K. It will cover all of the following:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We started Chick-a-BOOM! TV because we have been unable to find fun, informative, and entertaining video programming for women in the outdoors. We decided it was time for us to step up and do something about it. </p>
<p>Instead of just a pre-taped video format, we opted for a conversational approach that allows us to live stream our shows on FaceBook so that you, our audience, can participate in the discussion with our panelists by posting your comments and questions throughout the show. We can then bring your voice into our live discussion with our panelists. We want to hear from YOU! </p>

<p>Our first two episodes were produced with the generosity of ButcherBird Studios, but they can't work for free forever.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help producing episode three.  This idea came to me 2 years ago, but didn’t pursue it because I envisioned it produced professionally, like you can see in episode 1 and 2.  That’s because Butcherbird Studios and namely Jason Milligan, believed in our message and donated their time and resources to make this vision a reality.  It takes a (6) person crew and thousands of dollar’s worth of equipment to give us the look and flawless streaming you deserve.  Your donation will help us produce episode 3 in front of a live audience at the REI – Burbank location.</p>
<p>We have the extreme gift to film episode three at REI – Burbank inside their community room with a LIVE audience.  We are bringing in Wendy Engelberg  Girlz Gone Riding Director.</p>
<p>The benefits to you are:</p>
<p>The top 50 donations that live in the Los Angeles area can be a part of our live audience!</p>
<p>Meet in person our special guest; Wendy Engelberg, Director of Girlz Gone Riding </p>
<p>If you don’t live in the area, you can still participate on Facebook live. </p>
<p>We want to continue to bring your fresh content and sponsorship coupons and prizes.</p>
<p>We want to bring you t-shirts that scream “Chick-a-BOOM! Tv”, and share pictures of your rocking them at mountain tops and down in the valleys!</p>

<p>It gives us three episodes to pull from to make a well-rounded marketing piece for investors.</p>
<p>We need $2,000 to make Episode 3 look as professional as the previous episodes.</p>
<p>This is our first step at bringing you closer to the confidence you should feel outdoors. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Mother Nature offers grounding, empowerment, strength (physical and emotional), peace, confidence, and clarity.  Women benefit from all of these attributes Mother Nature offers, but we’re still afraid, suppressed, or because of our obligations to our family, don’t feel we have the time to enjoy these activates.  We can tell you, we NEED to explore, seek, wander, summit, and sweat, because when we do, we SOAR!  Not only at home are we more calm and happy, but in the workplace we are strong and confident.</p>
<p>Let’s step outside together.</p>
<ul><li>Whether you are just acknowledging your craving for adventure or want to take your adventure to a higher level.  We can take you there!  No questions are too trivial, too personal or too crazy sounding to us.  We love it all and are inspired by you too. Let’s ignite the fuse to this outdoors discussion movement.  </li></ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We started Chick-a-BOOM! TV because we have been unable to find fun, informative, and entertaining video programming for women in the outdoors. We decided it was time for us to step up and do something about it. 
Instead of just a pre-taped video format, we opted for a conversational approach that allows us to live stream our shows on FaceBook so that you, our audience, can participate in the discussion with our panelists by posting your comments and questions throughout the show. We can then bring your voice into our live discussion with our panelists. We want to hear from YOU! 
After the live show, the video continues to be available for viewing in perpetuity on YouTube and through other avenues. The show is approximately 45 minutes long. 
The visual style of our program is a bit of a mash-up akin to “The View, meets The Ellen Show, meets Outdoor Magazine.” 
We deliver content that is educational, relatable and adventurous in a raw, entertaining format that resonates and motivates.  The destinations and disciplines will be diverse in nature, from mountain peaks, to high waves to crag climbing, if it happens in Mother Nature, we’re discussing it with you on CHICK-A-BOOM! TV.
The panel of anchors and guests rotates depending on topic with no more than 5 panelist with the core team being Cyndi Wyatt and Marilee Valkass. As the audience base grows, we will incorporate field reporting in diverse locations.
Through the perspective of women, CHICK-A-BOOM! tv leaves the audience with a simple message.  Ignite the fuse to your adventurous lifestyle.   
Our current goal is to product one 45 minute show per month live streaming on FaceBook and then posted to YouTube for subsequent viewing.  
Our first two episodes were produced with the generosity of ButcherBird Studios, but they can't work for free forever.

<p>As artists who work in projects we believe in, the costs of a large expansive animation studio setup are difficult to meet. This poses itself as a hindrance for us in reaching our dreams. In order to counter this, we have started a small studio setup; wherein we handle more and more projects virtually, making it an affordable option for quality work.<br/>This studio is primarily made for service projects.</p>
<p>In the last five years, even since this studio’s inception; we have added some worthy service projects to our portfolio. However, ever since the competition is ever rising and awareness is limited due to our resources, we are facing challenges in order to keep stability for our employees. Our remote employees do not have any consistency in terms of workflow and the working capital also gets compromised due to this. The team that works on projects consists of core animators, artists and technicians who have done impeccable work in the past fourteen years. With their expertise shadowing the studio, we are managing to deliver quality. However, we are being tied up due to lack of required resources.</p>
<p>This is when we realized, that we wanted to take it a notch ahead. Generating more employment is necessary on a local and global level, but in today’s digital age, even targeting global audience is not a big challenge. Hence, our idea of IP animated TV series project simultaneously while working on the development of this platform has given us a base to resume our dream. We are currently stuck with a project, but with your help, another animation masterpiece is surely going to reach a step closer to its completion.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need ?</strong></p>
<p>As of current progress, we have completed a Show Pitch Bible and even created the Title Promotional Theme song for Mr. Buddy. We would be very grateful,if fellow passion animation lovers such as you could help us with 2D animation visual development. At the moment our skill base is met with.We just require funding to complete our project. Additionally, our hardworking team needs to be rewarded monetarily.So,to keep the project on we need our compositors, animators,Creative Director, Art director and even visual developers to have some compensation. We basically need a little support so this dream gets out of the pipeline and realizes in the animation realm.</p>
<p><strong>Recorded Title Song(Full Version):</strong></p>

<p>Buddy believes in making every day look magical! But his inventions will not be enough to explore the historic past of his hidden precious thing.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","As artists who work in projects we believe in, the costs of a large expansive animation studio setup are difficult to meet. This poses itself as a hindrance for us in reaching our dreams. In order to counter this, we have started a small studio setup; wherein we handle more and more projects virtually, making it an affordable option for quality work.This studio is primarily made for service projects.
In the last five years, even since this studio’s inception; we have added some worthy service projects to our portfolio. However, ever since the competition is ever rising and awareness is limited due to our resources, we are facing challenges in order to keep stability for our employees. Our remote employees do not have any consistency in terms of workflow and the working capital also gets compromised due to this. The team that works on projects consists of core animators, artists and technicians who have done impeccable work in the past fourteen years. With their expertise shadowing the studio, we are managing to deliver quality. However, we are being tied up due to lack of required resources.
This is when we realized, that we wanted to take it a notch ahead. Generating more employment is necessary on a local and global level, but in today’s digital age, even targeting global audience is not a big challenge. Hence, our idea of IP animated TV series project simultaneously while working on the development of this platform has given us a base to resume our dream. We are currently stuck with a project, but with your help, another animation masterpiece is surely going to reach a step closer to its completion.
What We Need ?
As of current progress, we have completed a Show Pitch Bible and even created the Title Promotional Theme song for Mr. Buddy. We would be very grateful,if fellow passion animation lovers such as you could help us with 2D animation visual development. At the moment our skill base is met with.We just require funding to complete our project. Additionally, our hardworking team needs to be rewarded monetarily.So,to keep the project on we need our compositors, animators,Creative Director, Art director and even visual developers to have some compensation. We basically need a little support so this dream gets out of the pipeline and realizes in the animation realm.

<h3>About This Series</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560157618/bmearypg8rhlhnvncsc3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This story brings you into the harsh world of inner-city LGBT+ youth that many don’t know exist.  From homelessness to bullying to suicide, we give you a glimpse into these delicate lives in an effort to bring light to their stories.  You’ll also get to see why the types of organizations depicted in this series are very much needed in minority communities, although they are not widely accessible.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Series Matters</h3>
<p>The depiction of LGBT+ people in film is often controlled by Hollywood and seldom gives you a glimpse into the lives our urban minority members of the LGBT+ community.  There is a growing need to help normalize what it means to be gay in society as the impact is detrimental:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pathology exists within black and other minority populations where LGBT+ teens, pre-teens, and young adults are being tossed out of their homes, attacked, bullied, exploited, and even killed.     </li>
<li>Gay and lesbian teens are 4 times more likely to commit suicide and transgender teens are 10 times more likely to commit suicide.</li>
<li>43% of homeless people who use shelters and drop-in centers in the United States identify as being LGBT+.</li>
<li>Each episode of LGBT+ victimization, such as physical or verbal harassment or abuse, increases the likelihood of self-harming behavior by 2.5 times on average.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560157682/hi6rg6tilkfl9qz3z9vf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In other words, this matters because lives are at stake and their stories often go unheard. As a member of the LGBT+ community (Jimmy) and good-standing members of the human race (my non-LGBT+ team), we feel obligated to do what we can to bring awareness to these very important issues and to treat them fairly and respectfully.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Working with Taskforce</h3>
<p>The community center depicted in this series pays homage to a wonderful organization I became aware of just a few years ago, though they have been on a goodwill mission helping LGBT+ youth and anyone else for many years.  Founded in 1990, Taskforce Prevention and Community Services provides HIV and STI preventative services, education, mentoring, and care to the African American community while provide a safe space for disenfranchised adolescents and young adults who live in communities with limited resources…the majority of whom identify as LGBT+.  Taskforce is also an avid supporter of the Chicago Ballroom scene. We have been fortunate enough to work on film/media projects with this organization dealing with violence prevention, HIV and STI education, domestic violence, and more.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560157923/sj0jx7l8lnu1kmkj6h2f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As a key component of the mission of this series, we look to forward to conducting workshops with the young patrons served by Taskforce to review the series’ scripts and get input on the difficulties of growing up in minority communities with limited resources and often poor regard for the LGBT+ community.  We are also excited to have solicited the acting skills of some of these young people for our series with plans to include even more.  It is important that we treat their stories carefully and pay them fairly for their time and efforts. </p>

<h3>Filming is Expensive!</h3>

<p>The cost of producing this series is approximately $7,000 per episode.  We have a flexible goal of $35,000 to record the next 5 episodes in this series spread over 33 days of filming.  If we are fortunate enough to get more, we will add more exciting and much needed episodes.  Though the scope of this series has a broad and important impact, we are keeping our costs down thanks to our filmmaker’s extensive experience with corporate project management and corporate video production. </p>
<p>Our production expenses include film equipment rentals and acquisitions (lenses, sound, lighting, stabilization, etc.), cast and crew pay (feature and background actors, director, cinematographer, production team, sound recordist, grip, make-up and wardrobe, etc.), transportation and travel, craft services, insurance, location fees, film permits, post production (editing, color correction and grading), and more. We are fortunate enough to own our own cinema camera and b-roll cameras.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone and Welcome to ""GET SEASON ONE OF GIRL MEETS GOY MADE!""</p>
<p>My name is Amanda Shilo Braverman, and I am the creator and writer of ""Girl Meets Goy"". I have written a show that is about relationships with a twist. ""Goy"" means not Jewish in the Yiddish language. I think you can see where I am going...</p>
<p>This started as a passion project that I needed to get made. I saved up my money and created a proof of concept (POC) that was 9 mins long, to show networks and production companies what the show could look like. I submitted to a few film festivals and was a finalist for:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599489285/dwm3bnbeb1ecbdew4rtl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Now that that is done, I have been writing season 1! The actors that were in the POC have been on board since the first read-through of the Pilot script.</p>
<p>It is very important to me that I get this show made because I feel that a lot of people would relate to the characters:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Audiences will learn a little bit about the Jewish culture through the main character and her family. I am writing story lines about Inter-religion relationships, At work romances, starting new careers later in life, following your dreams and so much more with a comedic and musical twist.</p>
<p>Here is a sneak peek at the first Musical Number:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

The rest of the money would go towards the first episode, pay the actors and musicians involved. We are looking to ensure everyone’s safety and want to ensure that we are taking the appropriate precautions during this time. We are looking into procuring appropriate transportation for crew and talent so they can safely get to rehearsals and recording sessions. </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Hello everyone and Welcome to ""GET SEASON ONE OF GIRL MEETS GOY MADE!""
My name is Amanda Shilo Braverman, and I am the creator and writer of ""Girl Meets Goy"". I have written a show that is about relationships with a twist. ""Goy"" means not Jewish in the Yiddish language. I think you can see where I am going...
This started as a passion project that I needed to get made. I saved up my money and created a proof of concept (POC) that was 9 mins long, to show networks and production companies what the show could look like. I submitted to a few film festivals and was a finalist for:
 

 
Now that that is done, I have been writing season 1! The actors that were in the POC have been on board since the first read-through of the Pilot script.
It is very important to me that I get this show made because I feel that a lot of people would relate to the characters:
 



 
Audiences will learn a little bit about the Jewish culture through the main character and her family. I am writing story lines about Inter-religion relationships, At work romances, starting new careers later in life, following your dreams and so much more with a comedic and musical twist.
Here is a sneak peek at the first Musical Number:

 

What We Need & What You Get
I am looking to raise $50,000 from crowdfunding to pay for pre production costs and to get the first few episodes filmed. As the show is meant to be a musical, we need to pay for a composer, a studio, a mixing engineer and any other fees that come up with recording 30 plus songs. The rest of the money would go towards the first episode, pay the actors and musicians involved. We are looking to ensure everyone’s safety and want to ensure that we are taking the appropriate precautions during this time. We are looking into procuring appropriate transportation for crew and talent so they can safely get to rehearsals and recording sessions. 

Donate $10 you will receive an Instagram Shout Out thanking you for your support!
Donate $15 you will receive a signed postcard from the main characters 
Donate $30 you will receive a signed copy of ""Girl Meets Goy: A guide to the ""Jewish"" Slang"" A picture colouring book/dictionary of Jewish words used throughout the show (plus some bonus ones)
Donate $50 you will receive a Girl Meets Goy T-shirt.
Donate $125 you will get a personal video message from the creator (Plus a T-shirt and signed copy of the book!).
Donate $500 you will get a signed copy of the pilot script. (Plus a T-shirt and signed copy of the book!).
Donate $10,000 you will get an digital copy of the songs that will be in the show! (Plus a T-shirt and signed copy of the book!).
Donate $15,000, Amanda (the creator and writer) will give you a sneak peek of what the future episodes look like before anyone else.  (Plus a T-shirt and signed copy of the book!).
Donate $50,000, you will get your name in the credits and 5% equity, plus all the above! (Plus a T-shirt and signed copy of the book!).
If I don't receive all the money requested, the show will go on! This is just a portion of the money we need to start production rolling! 

 
Here Are Some Teasers!

  
 
 
 

Exciting News When We Get the Funding!
Dynamic duo Sebastian Hugeneck and Igor Meshcheriakov will be joining the ""Girl Meets Goy"" team as song-producers for the show once we raise the funds!

                           Sebastian Hugeneck                                                          Igor Meshceriakov
 
Your contributions will go into ensuring we get this team for season one!
Why do we want this team so badly? Let us introduce you to them:
 
Sebastian Hugeneck- Composer:
Sebastian Hugeneck grew up in Vienna, Austria absorbed in classical music. He took to piano like bread to butter discovering that composing was his calling.

<h3>Who am I and what am I trying to achieve?</h3>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>My name is Josh Macrow. I am a puppeteer currently studying at The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.</p>
<p>For my final project I am making a TV Pilot with a key focus on puppetry. I am a huge Sci-Fi fan who really wants to push his puppetry to the limit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, making puppets and films is expensive which is why I need your help. I will be making puppets, building sets, and sourcing locations. Any donations will help make the film and feed my magnificent crew. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why the crowdfunder? </h3>
<p>I have set my goal at £1,500. What will this cover?</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of my voluntary crew will be travelling from all over the UK. My main goal is to pay for their transport, fed them, and give them a suitable place to stay. </li>
<li>The Alien puppets that will be built for the production need to be made from the right materials to look realistic. These materials cost money and without this I will have nothing to puppeteer except my bare hand. </li>
<li>The Aliens need somewhere to live. I will be building multiple sets for the Pilot and to make them look the best they can. For this I will need to be able to buy the right materials to get the job done.</li>
<li>Rewards for you! Some of the budget will be spent on producing lovely gifts so you can always remember what you helped to create. Have a look and see what perks interest you.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What will this help me achieve?</h3>
<p>For many years I have been a freelance puppeteer, working for my company JJ Puppets, performing solo shows for parties and events, as well as working for multiple theatre companies all over the country.  I have always dreamed of being a professional television puppeteer and my hope is if I can make this project the best it can be, I will have a great example of my work to show to professionals in the industry. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What else can be done to help?</h3>
<p>I understand that not everyone is in a position to help me with the funds. If this is the case but you would still like to help, please considering doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign with anyone that may be interested.</li>
<li>If you are creative and would like to help with the project, please email josh@jjpuppets.co.uk.</li>

<h3>About .org </h3>
<p>We're 20+ year nonprofit veterans and our mission is, through humor, to raise awareness about the climate crisis, environmental justice, and the nonprofit industrial complex. We're making a mockumentary sitcom (<a href=""https://dotorgshow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dotorgshow.com</a>) because so many funny and ridiculous (...and sometimes dysfunctional) things happen in nonprofits, we just have to write about them. </p>
<p>.org tells the story of the staff of a small environmental nonprofit in the South who must fight to accomplish their mission despite funding struggles, hapless leadership, and living in a culture of climate denial.</p>
<p>This short web series is an independent production, filmed in documentary style with a mix of improvisation and scripted material. We're filming in the South because the South is funny and we want to support the incredible creative talent in this area. (And also this is where the showrunner can sneak in to film at places after hours - shhhhhh.)</p>
<p>In true nonprofit spirit, we're doing this on a shoestring budget and borrowing everything we can. We are, however, committed to paying the folks involved in this at least something, because artists and creative people should not always be asked to do everything for free-sies.</p>
<p>Your support will help us finish post-production of Episode 1, and to film episode 2 this fall. Yay! Oh boy do we have a lot of stories to tell! Thank YOU so much for helping us tell them. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We're Doing This Indiegogo-thing</h3>
<p>Just like the small nonprofits we intend to focus on -- some may say ""make fun of"" -- in .org, we need more $$. Those complimentary packets of ketchup only go so far, you know. </p>
<p>Our goal is to complete the first 2 episodes and use those to apply for those harder to obtain large funding sources like GRANTS and sponsorships and stuff.  We aim to raise $10,000 in the next few months, which will allow us to complete the first 2 episodes, and to begin developing and writing the scripts for the next few episodes. It may not be obvious since everyone's Grandmother has a youtube channel now, but writing and video editing can be HARD! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We also welcome folks to help in ways that are non-monetary.</p>
<p>Can you help us get the word out about this to your networks, and especially to your friends who work at a nonprofit? They need cheering up, trust me. </p>
<p>Do you have crazy nonprofit stories that we need to know about? Hit us up, either in line at Harris Teeter, or at our website, <a href=""http://www.dotorgshow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dotorgshow.com</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have a home or office in or near Durham, NC, where we could film? (Do you have a pool? Can we just come use your pool????)</p>
<p>Do you have equipment we could borrow? How about a trove of cool clothes we could borrow sometime for costumes? Do you hoard wigs? (It's OK we don't judge).</p>
<p>Are you a musician who would like to perform on an episode and/or contribute some music?  </p>
<p>Do you have any airline miles you don't plan on using and would share? </p>
<p>Thanks for helping us in ANY way you see fit! </p>

<p>Why are we here?</p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hi! I'm Ash Willeby, the writer.</span> </li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">While I went through college, I worked on film sets, small and large. I've held many positions, including- Production Assistant, Craft Services, Second A.D., Prop Master, Set Decorator, Art Director, and Production Designer.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">After getting my Master's in Psychology, I decided my skills and temperament were better suited to screenwriting. I write female-driven comedies, so I can see more stories I relate to get onto the big screen.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">You may have seen my numerous posts about my feature A GOOD RUCKUS collecting laurels.

<h3><u>Using Funds, To The Max!</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>What are the funds actually for?</p>
<p>We want to make a high-quality pilot for this web series. So, we want to hire skilled professionals to help this idea manifest. </p>
<p>Some of our talented friends, who do this for a living, have agreed to adjusted fee schedules, because they want to see this pilot made. </p>
<p>Not only will this pilot be the beginning of the Web Series: A GOOD RUCKUS, the footage can also be used to showcase the style and  comedy of the award-winning feature-length script of the same name.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Location: To be able to film at the High School, with kids, we need to have stellar insurance. We will also need to cover any facility fees, including janitorial, permits, and for staff/admin to be present.</p></li>
<li><p>Lodging: Our High School location is a bit out of town. We'll need to have places for the crew to sleep after a long day of shooting. No driving accidents due to exhaustion!</p></li>
<li><p>Equipment: We will need to rent sound, grip, lighting and camera packages, to make sure filming goes smoothly.</p></li>
<li><p>Food: I, for one, get grumpy when I’m hungry. No use having any hangry cast or crew. We will ensure everyone has plenty to eat on set, including those with dietary restrictions.</p></li>
<li><p>Post Production: We need this pilot to have that sweet 80s feel! Editing, Soundtrack, Graphics… some of the things no one notices when they are done right.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Professional Crew? Wicked!</u></h3>
<p> </p>

Why are we here?

Hi! I'm Ash Willeby, the writer. 
While I went through college, I worked on film sets, small and large. I've held many positions, including- Production Assistant, Craft Services, Second A.D., Prop Master, Set Decorator, Art Director, and Production Designer.
After getting my Master's in Psychology, I decided my skills and temperament were better suited to screenwriting. I write female-driven comedies, so I can see more stories I relate to get onto the big screen.
You may have seen my numerous posts about my feature A GOOD RUCKUS collecting laurels. It's the story of Carole Franklin, a teacher in her fifth year who gets so bored of the daily grind that she invents some excitement for herself and her best friend. 

 
This is the web series that focuses on Carole, as a newbie teacher. The first season will be about Carole finding her footing, learning her strengths, and making a friend. 
 

 

Any contribution will assist in us making a high-quality pilot that can be used to secure funding for the remainder of the series.  

 


 
Get Stoked!
 
What's up for grabs?

If you're looking for your next IMDb credit, there are multiple perks for you. 
Or get your first IMDb credit! We'll create a page for you. 
Maybe you just love that 80s movie vibe, and want to see what happens. 
There is something for all budgets.


 
What are the Cliques?





 
Using Funds, To The Max!
 
What are the funds actually for?
We want to make a high-quality pilot for this web series. So, we want to hire skilled professionals to help this idea manifest. 
Some of our talented friends, who do this for a living, have agreed to adjusted fee schedules, because they want to see this pilot made. 
Not only will this pilot be the beginning of the Web Series: A GOOD RUCKUS, the footage can also be used to showcase the style and  comedy of the award-winning feature-length script of the same name.
 

Location: To be able to film at the High School, with kids, we need to have stellar insurance. We will also need to cover any facility fees, including janitorial, permits, and for staff/admin to be present.
Lodging: Our High School location is a bit out of town. We'll need to have places for the crew to sleep after a long day of shooting. No driving accidents due to exhaustion!
Equipment: We will need to rent sound, grip, lighting and camera packages, to make sure filming goes smoothly.
Food: I, for one, get grumpy when I’m hungry. No use having any hangry cast or crew. We will ensure everyone has plenty to eat on set, including those with dietary restrictions.
Post Production: We need this pilot to have that sweet 80s feel! Editing, Soundtrack, Graphics… some of the things no one notices when they are done right.

 
Professional Crew? Wicked!
 
What all do we need?
 
Good lighting is important on a long day in a library full of windows. Our Grip and Electric Departments will make sure we look like we’re in the same ten minutes, all day long.
Great sound is vital for any film. We will need quality equipment and expertise.
Hair and Makeup will help us balance the subtle nods to the 80s with current trends.
Catering and Craft Services will ensure everyone is fed and hydrated. And that we’ll have coffee… lots of coffee…
Art Department will help make sure everything looks great- and stays the same throughout filming.
Camera department will capture the magic.
 
The current crew slated for this production are people we have worked with before in Austin. They’ve worked on indies as well as larger productions (such as The Leftovers, Fear The Walking Dead, Alita: Battle Angel). We're glad to have so many of our talented friends agree to help us make this pilot! 
 

Stretch Goals
 
What would help make this pilot Totally Tubular?

5,000:  We can get a composer, to help us get that 80s feel. Hey, we might even create a theme song!
7,500: Pick-up shots, and another editing session, to create a true Proof of Concept for our feature.
9,000: We’ll be able to do a second day of shooting. This would be great, since some of the kids will be actual students at the High School. Kids need shorter shoot days, so not being rushed will result in a better finished pilot.
10,000: We can submit to festivals, and share this pilot with many more 80s-inspired film lovers.

Ken has written one act plays for UCLA’s LCC Theatre Company (founded by Randall Park in ‘95); sketch comedy for weekly performance teams at The Second City Hollywood, UCB, and iO West; and feature films for hire.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our funding will be used for production and post production costs as well as festival submissions and marketing. </p>
<p>Obviously we've called in A LOT of favors, but we NEED $6,263.11 to get us through production. The rest will cover our post production costs and film festival submissions. We talked to a lot of people who have fundraised before and one of the biggest mistakes was not raising enough to cover through post production. That is why we're asking for the full $7,500. That will make sure we can get a quality finished project and present it at great festivals and opportunities.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create 5-8 minute episodes that challenge audiences to think about technology, society, and ethics through emotional, character-driven stories. </p>

Ken Rudnick (IMDb): Born in Los Angeles means two things for Ken: one, he says “the” when referring to freeways and thinks it is normal, and two, he’s never really grown up. Ken shot his first short film at the age of 7, a stop motion production about toy cars racing. He grew up training in martial arts and was an instructor at his dojo through high school and college. Ken has written one act plays for UCLA’s LCC Theatre Company (founded by Randall Park in ‘95); sketch comedy for weekly performance teams at The Second City Hollywood, UCB, and iO West; and feature films for hire. But he dreamed of running TV shows and so he created Midnight Bytes. Ken currently works in TV writer support staff positions, most recently as the Writers’ PA on the final season of Fresh Off The Boat. Vik Ramen (IMDb):  Born in Starnberg, Germany and raised in the labs at the Max Planck Institute, Vik has always been fascinated by the implications of science and technology on society. Vik’s focus on using the power of media to improve the trajectory of humanity in the future has led to public appearances with Actor Kal Penn, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, and President Barack Obama. Coming off his directorial debut in the dystopian short film, ""Welcome to Life,"" featured in the Silver State Film Festival (Las Vegas), Marina del Rey Film Festival, and Golden State Film Festival (Hollywood), he’s seeking to further explore the many possible futures of humanity through the medium of film and television.  Megan Maher (IMDb): Megan Maher is a writer from Boca Raton, FL and a graduate of the University of Central Florida. Currently, Megan is Showrunner Assistant for the upcoming limited series Washington Black at Hulu. She is also the creator, writer, and director of the short film trilogy, “Clandestine Magic”; co-creator of the webseries “Perspectives”; and a journalist and editor for the popular tv, film and books blog, Black Girl Nerds. Megan is a well-rounded writer with an emphasis on magical realism. Diverse and the youngest of six, Megan cultivates the audience by delivering a distinct and original voice in her story telling. Jacob Arbittier (IMDb): Jacob Arbittier is a director and producer living in Los Angeles. He's originally from the east coast and the moment he first watched BLAIR WITCH PROJECT as a kid knew his mission was to create genre work that stays with audiences. Jacob studied at Syracuse University and has worked with major Hollywood production companies including Blumhouse and Dreamworks Animation. Hannah Ahn (IMDb):  Born near Silicon Valley, Hannah always thought she’d grow up to be a Girl who Codes. Instead, she ended up flying to the opposite coast to study anthropology and human rights at Columbia University. A Guggenheim Criminal Justice Fellow, she worked for public defenders and visited clients on Rikers Island before pivoting yet again to become a writer. She enjoys using sci-fi elements to explore themes of social justice. Most recently, she wrote and directed a short called “Poisonberries,” which screened at the Athena Film Festival. She is currently a literary assistant at Culture Creative Entertainment.

What We Need & What You Get
Our funding will be used for production and post production costs as well as festival submissions and marketing. 
Obviously we've called in A LOT of favors, but we NEED $6,263.11 to get us through production. The rest will cover our post production costs and film festival submissions. We talked to a lot of people who have fundraised before and one of the biggest mistakes was not raising enough to cover through post production. That is why we're asking for the full $7,500. That will make sure we can get a quality finished project and present it at great festivals and opportunities.
You can view our full budget here.
But you also get something for supporting! CHECK OUT OUR PERKS! Signed scripts, opportunities to meet and sit in with our writers' room, and much more! 
If we don't reach our goal... we'll still be using all the funds we receive to produce this episode... it's just gonna mean skipping a few meals for a while lol. 
 

The Impact
Our goal is to create 5-8 minute episodes that challenge audiences to think about technology, society, and ethics through emotional, character-driven stories. 
We have an outstanding, fresh, diverse cast of talent that your donations will help support by allowing us to make the best film possible and compensate them for their time.

She is lovable and fun. Her most noticeable trait is empathy. Eileen is always the friend that checks in and validates those around her. Her empathy is extended to wildlife, as she is a vegan. Eileen’s attitude comes from existential consciousness. She knows she won’t live forever and uses that as motivation to have as much fun as possible. Eileen is an up and coming actress. If she has to have a job to benefit our capitalist society, then at least it’ll be a fun one!

She feels frustrated with the way things are handled and wants to change them. Eve does things in extremes. When she is sad, all of her is sad. When she is happy, all of her is happy. Like any other starving student, Eve is an anxious mess. There is so much that is out of her control. The more she focuses on it, the more it seems to swallow her whole.

This season they learn they don’t have to compete with each other. If they work together, they can all make it.</p><p>As Eve reflects on her education, she realizes how limited her knowledge is. Despite eighteen years of schooling, Eve doesn't have any basic life skills at all. She was never taught how to pay taxes, how to change a tire; or even simple things, like how to tie a tie. Eve was never taught how to love herself or how to take care of her mental health. This inspires Eve to create her own school curriculum.

She is lovable and fun. Her most noticeable trait is empathy. Eileen is always the friend that checks in and validates those around her. Her empathy is extended to wildlife, as she is a vegan. Eileen’s attitude comes from existential consciousness. She knows she won’t live forever and uses that as motivation to have as much fun as possible. Eileen is an up and coming actress. If she has to have a job to benefit our capitalist society, then at least it’ll be a fun one! Though the film industry isn’t as welcoming as she’d hoped; nothing will stop Eileen from accomplishing her goals.""Maybe home isn't a place. Maybe home is two arms and a heartbeat.""- Eileen MarieEve (25) [Played by Heather Dennis] Eve is Eileen’s older sister. She’s studying second year law in college. She’s not certain what she wants to do, but she knows she wants to work within the system. She feels frustrated with the way things are handled and wants to change them. Eve does things in extremes. When she is sad, all of her is sad. When she is happy, all of her is happy. Like any other starving student, Eve is an anxious mess. There is so much that is out of her control. The more she focuses on it, the more it seems to swallow her whole. Through Eileen’s guidance, Eve will learn to let go of these fears and enjoy life, come what may.""You can't stop doing what you love because you feel scared""- Eve MarieBARBRA (22)  [Yet to be cast] Eileen’s best friend/former roommate. Barbra is strong and confident. She’s also cynical and morally bankrupt. Anyone else might be turned off by this, but to Eileen, Barbra is perfect. Each girl has what the other lacks. In a way, Eileen and Barbra complete each other. Barbra is a journalist student. She wants to write for a newspaper and expose the capitalist pigs that run our society.""Morals are just ways to guilt people into not doing what they really want.""- Barbra BakerGWEN (24) [Yet to be cast] Barbra’s older sister. If Eileen and Eve have the ideal sister relationship, Barbra and Gwen are far more realistic. Constantly arguing and insulting each other. Their relationship is a complete mess. Gwen is an alcoholic, persistently jumping from one boyfriend to another. She doesn’t know what she wants to do with her life. All she really wants is to feel wanted. To feel loved by those around her. Is that too much to ask?""Don't stop letting people into your life.""- Gwen BakerJANET (25) [Yet to be cast] Janet is too cool for school. She’s a cop and a damn good one. Though she doesn’t get the praise she deserves on the force, she knows they’d be lost without her. Janet always comes across as powerful and intriguing. You can’t help but be drawn to her. Eileen and Eve’s adventures often get out of hand. That’s when Janet has to come in and clean up the mess. Janet is closest to Eve. Partially because they’re the same age and have interests in the law. Partially because Eve has been arrested multiple times.""Well, that person doesn't pay my bills. So I don't give a flying crap and we're moving on.""- Janet WhiteCHARLIE (21) [Yet to be cast] Charlie is the ultimate male role model. He’s relatable, charming, a good listener and very respectful. Charlie always wears vintage clothes from the thrift store he works at. He’s closest to Eileen and studies journalism with Barbra in school. Charlie regularly talks to a therapist, particularly about losing his mother at a young age. As season two progresses, Charlie comes to a life altering realization in therapy. Eileen is the first person he shares his secret with.""I started to question what manning up really means.""- Charlie StevensonThrough The Looking ""Grass""Eileen and Eve are both legal aged adults, living in Canada. Given the environment, it's only natural for the sisters to experiment with ""locally grown plants."" They do live in a garden after all. To avoid an issues with censorship, anytime a character is high it will be symbolized with them wearing sunglasses. This allows the concept to be communicated to the viewer without actually showing weed.Season OneIf being in your twenties in the 2020s wasn’t stressful enough, now the world has unexpectedly been put in quarantine. No longer able to work or be in a school environment, Eileen and Eve have resorted to moving back to their parent’s. Their solitude is found in the garden, where they explore relatable anxieties and find positive conclusions. Is it the end of the world or the start of their greatest adventure?Future SeasonsSeason Two: Are We There Yet?Eileen’s acting career begins. Unfortunately, it’s not as glamorous as it seems on TV. Audition after audition with no progress. The few roles she does land go from embarrassing to just plain degrading. Eileen finally gets cast in a horror movie. Too bad she’s playing the creature! Here she meets Bill. A successful actor who takes Eileen under his wing. With Bill’s help, Eileen might get her big break after all.Eve is excited to start her next semester of college. Finally allowed back on campus, Eve thought this would fix all of her problems. She couldn't have been more wrong. Manipulative teachers, endless nights of no sleep, mountains of assignments. The only thing higher then Eve's anxiety is her student loans! Why does pursuing an education have to be this painful? Eve questions if it's really worth finishing her college education or is it time to pursue a different path.Season Three: Life On The Murder SceneEileen has finally established her career. She assumed everything would be easy from this point, but she couldn’t be more wrong. The industry is far darker than Eileen ever imagined. Directors on drugs, psycho paparazzi, nutty actors; Eileen will see it all. Will Eileen’s lighthearted nature change the industry, or will the industry change her? Featuring true stories from the film industry.Eve always wanted to be a lawyer. Being in control, helping others, benefiting her community; it was everything she had dreamed of. So why doesn't Eve want it anymore? Eve is given the opportunity to assist on a court case. During this experience Eve learns that the law doesn't guarantee justice. Far from it. Eve comes to the bitter realization that many of our laws benefit those who are guilty far more than those who are victims. As her world begins to crumble around her, Eve is faced with a difficult choice. Should she continue to serve the law, knowing it's corruption; or does she abandon her life's work in favour of truly aiding those around her?  Season Four: Me TooEileen has had enough of the sexism only actresses have to experience. It’s time to take a stand. With the help of her fellow actresses; Eileen starts her own production company. The ladies team up to produce empowering films featuring all female casts (Trans females are of course included). In previous seasons, Eileen has despised some of these actresses. This season they learn they don’t have to compete with each other. If they work together, they can all make it.As Eve reflects on her education, she realizes how limited her knowledge is. Despite eighteen years of schooling, Eve doesn't have any basic life skills at all. She was never taught how to pay taxes, how to change a tire; or even simple things, like how to tie a tie. Eve was never taught how to love herself or how to take care of her mental health. This inspires Eve to create her own school curriculum. Designed to teach school subjects, as well as essential life skills; Eve's classes quickly grow a following. Eve decides to take this one step further and attempts to overthrow the school board. After all, isn't it about time that someone tore down the wall?Praise For ""Eileen's Garden""The following are quotes from a focus group.""I wish I had this show when I was younger."" - Adaire Brunson [22]""I love the music."" - Hilary Brook [14]""It felt like an 80s movie."" - Michael Burdo [30]""It's the only show I've ever seen that has female leads that talk about things other than men.""         - Katherine Bloom [36]""Hilarious, feel good.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>I (Sabean Bea) Originally wrote this series as I felt there wasn't a representation for real people in comedy in the UK in the same way there was in America. Anything that was based for working class showed crime and gang wars etc. I wanted something a lot more light which showed the reality of living and growing up working class and the natural funny situations and problems that came from different classes, our differences and similarities.

<p>Those videos you just watched are written, produced, shot, directed, and performed by a group of Chicago comedians. All of us hope to make a career of this one day.

And when you're a struggling comedian in Chicago, those pockets aren't filled with much other than a few old Chipotle receipts. </p>

<h3>Okay, so what's the money for? </h3>
<p>Well like we said, this ragtag group of Chicago comedians have been paying a lot out of their own pockets to work on a project that they are passionate about. Because as we've learned--you can't do anything for free. That being said, those pockets are pretty dry right now. So what do we need? Well in order to continue on with the great content we've had so far, we need a  few expenses covered. These expenses include: travel, equipment (lighting, sound, camera), location rentals, food (the old frozen pizza Brittany found in her freezer has only lasted us two shoots), props, costumes, paying our graphic designers, and more. </p>

<p>We have so far been able to produce three episodes of our show and it has cost us quite a bit.

<p>After years of cultivating a friendship, Tommy and Callie bonded heavily over dealing with unrelenting mental and physical health issues. Electron Blade started as a seed of an idea, and flourished under their necessity to find meaning in what often felt like a meaningless existence. As the themes in the story will show, it became their hope in the face of despair. After a winter's worth of writing, rewriting, rerewriting, casting, creating, and growing their team of talented individuals, everything has fallen into place, except one thing: the funds to make it happen.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Electron Blade is a story that needs to be told, a story about the outcasts and the derelicts finding family and hope in each other, a story about compassion no matter what the creed or color. It's about standing up for what's right and what you believe in, and to always have hope in the face of despair. In a world so full of despair and intolerance, TK2 Films would like to shed a little bit of light into the darkness.</p>
<p>In the past, Tommy has launched two incredibly successful Kickstarter campaigns, one for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l94v4YOqxOc&amp;t=1886s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Star Trek - Horizon""</a> and ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/2WwcFBbTkF0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Runaway</a>"", both exceeding their asked for budgets, and TK2 Films has continued to have a growing network of fans and supporters helping them to continue to create.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>So far, their main challenge has come down to the budget. While Tommy works freelance, and Callie serves beer when she's not creating, their combined salaries are not enough to hire the cast and crew and purchase the equipment necessary to launch their story! </p>
<p>Everything they've created so far has either come from the generosity and time donation of their team, or money from their own pockets!</p>

<h3>About Cathy Richardson's Project 365</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm a singer, songwriter, musician and producer and I've been playing music professionally for the past 25 years. Most notably, I've been the lead singer of the classic rock band Jefferson Starship for the past decade. Before that I toured with Big Brother and the Holding Co. after portraying Janis Joplin in several cities in an Off Broadway show called <i>Love, Janis</i>. And since I started my career in the 90s, I've been an original artist, writing songs, producing and releasing independent albums under my name, Cathy Richardson Band, and the Macrodots. I even received a GRAMMY Nomination for the album art on my 2003 release the Road to Bliss, as a 100% DIY music artist. </p>
<p>Jefferson Starship is a fantastic, high profile gig that is an incredible showcase for me as a performer, but we are only on the road part of the year. That said, it's my main gig so I need to keep myself pretty open to accommodate the ever-fluctuating schedule. So, last December, I had this crazy/ambitious idea to post a song every day this year on my YouTube channel. It would increase my reach to new fans and inspire daily engagement with my existing fan base. And, hopefully, create another revenue stream- something I can do either from home or the road- to supplement my income when live shows are scarce. </p>
<p>A lot has changed in the world and my life since I first started my quest for rock stardom. There are lots of new and different ways to make money in music but independent artists like me really need to hustle, diversify and get creative to <i>make a living. </i></p>
<p>Project 365 is a ginormous undertaking and I really had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started. Yes, I had major apprehensions and, in spite of them, with the encouragement of a few close friends, I dove in head first.</p>
<p>That first week, I thought, OH MY GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE, when I began to see the enormity of time that simply recording a video takes, let alone editing, uploading and posting it. I immediately wanted to throw in the towel. I contemplated the level of humiliation from announcing a year long project and giving up a few days into it. Right away I could see that I had a giant learning curve and technical difficulties to overcome, I needed to devote <i>a lot</i> of time to it, and I needed some new and updated equipment. The first thing I did was buy a cheap tripod and new digital video camera since the one I was using was from the late 1900s. </p>
<p>And I kept making videos. Now that I've gotten into it, there are so many things I could use to make better videos. Lighting, backdrops, a better tripod, professional editing software, and a new, faster laptop to run said software, for example. </p>
<p>At the moment, my videos are getting an average of about 200 views each. I looked at my year-to-date YouTube earnings today and it's $25, about enough for dinner at Chipotle, but not even 5% of the new camera cost. Obviously, I need a lot more views in order to make YouTube a revenue stream of any significance! I could use part of the budget to promote the videos and get more views. </p>
<p>I'm also spending at least 1-3 hours on each video, sometimes more. I would be extraordinarily grateful for the energetic exchange of monetary reward for the amount of work, talent and time that goes into doing this every day. Maybe I could even pay someone to help me!</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago, right before I hit 100 videos, a fan from Facebook sent me a check for $100 to support the first 100 days. I cannot tell you how enormously grateful I was to receive that check because it truly could not have come at a better time. She told me she thought all my viewers should donate to keep me going. It got me thinking.</p>
<p>If 100 fans pledged $1 a day to my project, that budget would help to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update and upgrade my equipment to produce higher quality videos and increase productivity</li>
<li>Promote the videos &gt; get more views &gt; make new fans &gt; expand my audience to tour as a solo artist &gt; increase YouTube revenue</li>
<li>Help me keep the lights on at home. Literally. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I set the goal at $36,500 to represent the impact of just 100 people pledging $1 per video. I feel like this is a realistic goal, I have 1000+ subscribers on YouTube and 8.5k on Facebook. I realize not everyone can afford to pledge that much but some might be into a smaller donation to the cause. There might also be those wealthy patrons of the arts out there who wouldn't bat an eye at throwing down for the entire budget. Some, like my Facebook fan who came up with the dollar a day concept, might prefer to break it up into quarterly donations. Indiegogo campaigns only run for 60 days so I can always run another campaign down the road.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I am finished with this year, my goal is that I will significantly reach more people, make new fans and subscribers. My YouTube channel will be a self-sustaining income source and I will not have to ask my fans to donate to the cause, the videos will be free and my gift to the world. The quality and presentation of the videos will be of a higher standard. And when I have posted 365 videos, the world will know that I can (and will!) sing anything. My territory as a solo artist will expand so I can come play more shows for all of you outside Chicago when Jefferson Starship is not touring. And I will keep going! I'm already thinking ahead to 2020's Project 366! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute cash, I get it. You can still help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch the videos from beginning to end, and let the ads play!</li>
<li>Get the word out and let people know about Project 365</li>
<li>Do you have used equipment or other resources to donate?</li>
<li>Leave a comment, give a thumbs up!</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>
</div><p>I love and thank you so much for your support and encouragement. I promise to keep singing for you and producing more, and better, videos!! xo Cath</p></div>","About Cathy Richardson's Project 365

And, hopefully, create another revenue stream- something I can do either from home or the road- to supplement my income when live shows are scarce. 
A lot has changed in the world and my life since I first started my quest for rock stardom. There are lots of new and different ways to make money in music but independent artists like me really need to hustle, diversify and get creative to make a living. 
Project 365 is a ginormous undertaking and I really had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started. Yes, I had major apprehensions and, in spite of them, with the encouragement of a few close friends, I dove in head first.
That first week, I thought, OH MY GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE, when I began to see the enormity of time that simply recording a video takes, let alone editing, uploading and posting it. I immediately wanted to throw in the towel. I contemplated the level of humiliation from announcing a year long project and giving up a few days into it. Right away I could see that I had a giant learning curve and technical difficulties to overcome, I needed to devote a lot of time to it, and I needed some new and updated equipment. The first thing I did was buy a cheap tripod and new digital video camera since the one I was using was from the late 1900s. 
And I kept making videos. Now that I've gotten into it, there are so many things I could use to make better videos. Lighting, backdrops, a better tripod, professional editing software, and a new, faster laptop to run said software, for example. 
At the moment, my videos are getting an average of about 200 views each. I looked at my year-to-date YouTube earnings today and it's $25, about enough for dinner at Chipotle, but not even 5% of the new camera cost. Obviously, I need a lot more views in order to make YouTube a revenue stream of any significance! I could use part of the budget to promote the videos and get more views. 
I'm also spending at least 1-3 hours on each video, sometimes more. I would be extraordinarily grateful for the energetic exchange of monetary reward for the amount of work, talent and time that goes into doing this every day. Maybe I could even pay someone to help me!
A couple weeks ago, right before I hit 100 videos, a fan from Facebook sent me a check for $100 to support the first 100 days. I cannot tell you how enormously grateful I was to receive that check because it truly could not have come at a better time. She told me she thought all my viewers should donate to keep me going. It got me thinking.
If 100 fans pledged $1 a day to my project, that budget would help to:

Update and upgrade my equipment to produce higher quality videos and increase productivity
Promote the videos > get more views > make new fans > expand my audience to tour as a solo artist > increase YouTube revenue
Help me keep the lights on at home. Literally. 

 

What I Need & What You Get
I set the goal at $36,500 to represent the impact of just 100 people pledging $1 per video. I feel like this is a realistic goal, I have 1000+ subscribers on YouTube and 8.5k on Facebook. I realize not everyone can afford to pledge that much but some might be into a smaller donation to the cause. There might also be those wealthy patrons of the arts out there who wouldn't bat an eye at throwing down for the entire budget. Some, like my Facebook fan who came up with the dollar a day concept, might prefer to break it up into quarterly donations. Indiegogo campaigns only run for 60 days so I can always run another campaign down the road.

The Impact
When I am finished with this year, my goal is that I will significantly reach more people, make new fans and subscribers. My YouTube channel will be a self-sustaining income source and I will not have to ask my fans to donate to the cause, the videos will be free and my gift to the world. The quality and presentation of the videos will be of a higher standard. And when I have posted 365 videos, the world will know that I can (and will!) sing anything. My territory as a solo artist will expand so I can come play more shows for all of you outside Chicago when Jefferson Starship is not touring. And I will keep going! I'm already thinking ahead to 2020's Project 366! 

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute cash, I get it. You can still help!

Watch the videos from beginning to end, and let the ads play!
Get the word out and let people know about Project 365
Do you have used equipment or other resources to donate?
Leave a comment, give a thumbs up!
Use the Indiegogo share tools!

I love and thank you so much for your support and encouragement. I promise to keep singing for you and producing more, and better, videos!! xo Cath",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi Guys, I'm Dawntavia ""Dawn"" Bullard. The Creator, Writer, Producer &amp; Director of Brownsville. WOW! I can finally add Director to my title. This project is my directorial debut and I'm so excited to share it with you. Join me on this ground-breaking show that pushes the envelope.</p>
<p>I was born &amp; raised in Miami, Florida. In fact, I grew up in the inner-city of Brownsville. The same place the show is centered around. This series is based on real life events from my childhood and also real life events some of my friends experienced and shared with me. This is a passion project at the core of it. Very personal to me,  which is why I invested everything I had plus some ""I Owe Yous"" into the making of Brownsville. I believe in it so much that I personally invested over $12,000 into production.</p>
<p>Some of you may know me as an actress. I've been privileged to be a working actress in Hollywood. I've worked on some amazing TV shows like ""Underground on WGN &amp; Devious Maids on ABC. Also, my latest film ""Den Of Thieves"" starring Gerard Butler will release in theaters early 2018. Make sure you go watch it, I play ""Chaminade"". Feel free to check-out my full acting/writing resume on IMDB at <a href=""http://www.imdb.me/DawntaviaBullard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.imdb.me/DawntaviaBullard </a></p>
<p>I'm not just an actress. I'm a filmmaker. A storyteller. A writer. I began my career into the film &amp; television industry as an actress. Moving to Los Angeles after grade school. Leaving my comfort zone at just 18 years old. Yes, I was afraid but I went anyway. Yes, I was alone but I went anyway. Yes, I was nearly broke, but guess what... I went anyway. No one was going to convince me my dreams were just dreams. No one. - ""If you don't believe in yourself, no one else will""</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500994124/age1alaghaziroavyrfv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So I went out and followed my heart. I quickly realized Hollywood was not going to hand me, some young black girl from the inner-city an opportunity. Trust me, I asked and they said NO!!!!! I didn't want a handout. I just wanted an opportunity to work for it. Prove myself capable. But, no one in Hollywood was ready to give me a shot. So I went back to school, studied, read every book I could on screenwriting and began writing my own short films. Created my own acting opportunities. I soon after moved to Atlanta, the Hollywood of the South where my career blossomed.</p>

<h3>Story - What is Brownsville? </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500930826/kojy5a54no97vd2cb92c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The teens of Brownsville are always rife with problems. Whether it's about sexuality, growing up, drugs or parents, there's always something going at Brownsville High and at their homes.</p>
<p>We can all relate that being a teenager is hard, cruel, sometimes lonely, sometimes tragic. Especially when life at home ain't that much better than life at school. </p>
<p>Brownsville will be the complete opposite of the 90’s teen drama shows Hollywood presented to us. Shows I watched and loved but hardly ever saw a brown face in them. Shows like Dawson’s Creek, 90210 and The O.C. which followed a group of white friends around their privileged lives.</p>
<p>This series is ground breaking in the sense that there has never been a teen show that follows a group of ten Black and Hispanic friends on their coming of age journey.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500927093/w5ey890kh8g4szgzvihz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Brownsville seeks to serve a greater purpose to our youth by meeting them where they are. By creating characters they feel connected to and introducing plots and twists to their story-lines, we aim not to promote sex, drugs and violence but to instead take our audience on a journey through the real day to day struggle of bad, sometimes tragic, decision-making our youth experience daily.</p>
<p><strong>THE CAST - NEW FACES </strong></p>
<p><i>We have an incredible cast of talented young people. They act, sing, dance, you name it. This is there break-out performance and they are so eager to be on this journey with you all.</i></p>

<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>POST-PRODUCTION</strong></i></p>
<p>Now that we've shot everything for season one.  We've already invested over $12,000 for the filming of all seven episodes this summer. We paid for filming equipment rental (lights, camera, sound), the crew (AD, Cinematographer, Sound technicians, Grips), Set Decorations, Wardrobe, Travel and meals.  </p>
<p>Right now our number one goal is to complete post-production for all seven episodes with the most powerful imagery and incredible music and sound possible so that they show is the best quality it can be. </p>
<p>First, we will begin post production with the editing phase. Out of all the footage we filmed this summer, the editor will cut each episode out. This will take roughly 420 hours sitting in front of his computer day end and day out to edit all 7 episodes. We pay the editor hourly. </p>
<p>The second phase is the sound engineering phase to work on sound effects and foley for each episode. This person is paid by the hour.  </p>
<p>The third phase we will hire a Music Composer. This person will add music and scoring to each episode. This will take about 200 hours to work on the music for all seven episodes. This person is paid hourly.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your financial gift will allow all of us, the cast &amp; crew the opportunity to live out our dreams of writing, directing, acting, producing and most importantly you are funding something bigger than our dreams. You are funding what accomplishing our dreams will do to the people who look up to us and depend on us.</p>
<p>The younger generations who watch us work hard everyday to be successful. Your token of love &amp; support today, will plant the seed into someone's mind that people do believe in us, no matter where we come from or what color our skin may be. And for that, I say thank you a million times.</p>
<p>This series will remind all of us about those sensitive years in our lives, adolescent years and how those decisions we made back then impacted our future, sometimes for the good, sometimes for the bad. We hope this series inspires and entertain you. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Let's be honest! Our BIG goal would be to have this web-series win an EMMY. Yes. A real EMMY for best new media content. We can totally do it. BUT; please understand that this is a goal of ours and not a definite. </p>

<p>Another Goal is to sell the show to the marketplace; Netflix or a cable network. We will take our finish product to be considered by distributors. </p>
<p>Also, another goal is to submit the series to many film festivals around the country and abroad. We believe we will be accepted into many festivals and win awards along the way but that's not a definite either. We submit and wait to be accepted into the festival. We have to complete the project first.</p>

<p>My name is <strong>Emmanuel Christian</strong><strong> </strong>and in many ways four halves make a whole is my story. Am I an immigrant of ambiguous origin who was forced to live with siblings for a huge inheritance? No, no I am not. I was born in Brooklyn but raised in Ghana. I didn’t move back to the US until college and when I did move back I had to rediscover my mother, navigate a new dad (and to a small extent an old one), two new siblings, my blackness as an American and identity in general. “4 Halves Make a Whole” is a show <i>about</i> family and race but it’s also a show with characters that happen to be a family and happen to be different races. Furthermore, It’s also a show that doesn’t take itself too seriously because if there’s one thing I’ve learned in my life, it’s that sometimes you just have to laugh.</p>
<p>I’ve been in the entertainment industry for about five years now, primarily in front of the camera. This project is my first production..</p>

<p>My name is <strong>Tamara Tonge</strong> and I am Co-Producer, Co-Creator and Co-Star of “4 Halves Makes a Whole”. Film making has always been an interest of mine. I've always been attracted to anything that involves strangers coming together as one to create something great. Back in May, I found myself sitting on my living room couch watching the web series “Awkward Black Girl” created by Issa Rae. It had been my second time watching the series, but this time around I decided to research a little about the series. To my surprise, in a nutshell, “Awkward Black Girl” was just an idea that Issa Rae had and eventually made the decision to create and share with the world. She's a black woman who was inspired to create a web series and she simply went out and did it. Now, fast forward to 2017, she is one of the people on a rapidly growing list of successful black women who other aspiring entertainment industry members can look up to. I couldn't help but wonder one thing. Why am I just sitting on the couch? In that moment, I was both inspired and determined to make the move from admiring filmmakers, to becoming one. “Four Halves Make a Whole” has been nothing short of a labor of love since it's fruition and I can't wait to see it through to the end. </p>

<h3>BUDGET</h3>
<p>As you all know, or maybe some of you don't, making a 10 episode web series (10 minutes per episode) is almost like making a full length feature film.

My name is Emmanuel Christian and in many ways four halves make a whole is my story. Am I an immigrant of ambiguous origin who was forced to live with siblings for a huge inheritance? No, no I am not. I was born in Brooklyn but raised in Ghana. I didn’t move back to the US until college and when I did move back I had to rediscover my mother, navigate a new dad (and to a small extent an old one), two new siblings, my blackness as an American and identity in general. “4 Halves Make a Whole” is a show about family and race but it’s also a show with characters that happen to be a family and happen to be different races. Furthermore, It’s also a show that doesn’t take itself too seriously because if there’s one thing I’ve learned in my life, it’s that sometimes you just have to laugh.
I’ve been in the entertainment industry for about five years now, primarily in front of the camera. This project is my first production..
 

My name is Tamara Tonge and I am Co-Producer, Co-Creator and Co-Star of “4 Halves Makes a Whole”. Film making has always been an interest of mine. I've always been attracted to anything that involves strangers coming together as one to create something great. Back in May, I found myself sitting on my living room couch watching the web series “Awkward Black Girl” created by Issa Rae. It had been my second time watching the series, but this time around I decided to research a little about the series. To my surprise, in a nutshell, “Awkward Black Girl” was just an idea that Issa Rae had and eventually made the decision to create and share with the world. She's a black woman who was inspired to create a web series and she simply went out and did it. Now, fast forward to 2017, she is one of the people on a rapidly growing list of successful black women who other aspiring entertainment industry members can look up to. I couldn't help but wonder one thing. Why am I just sitting on the couch? In that moment, I was both inspired and determined to make the move from admiring filmmakers, to becoming one. “Four Halves Make a Whole” has been nothing short of a labor of love since it's fruition and I can't wait to see it through to the end.

BUDGET
As you all know, or maybe some of you don't, making a 10 episode web series (10 minutes per episode) is almost like making a full length feature film. The budget below reflects what we anticipate needing based on the previous shoot/episodes that have already been shot. As we see this as a very collaborative production, some of the perks for your contributions are really fun ways to join the team!

 
Impact
This campaign/show hopes to inspire people to ask important questions about identity as well as help people to embrace the idea of seeing the world through the eyes of others. On the logistics side, the campaign is also poised to inspire and promote women of color to be more prominent in the entertainment industry as their views and contributions are heavily valued and necessary- Big ups to our 2 producers Tee and Dee
Risks & Challenges
The producers and team have already put a lot into this project (finances, resources, time etc) and we realize the biggest challenge to creating this has been funding as it has been the biggest limiting factor.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I thought of Ghost Town while in my freshman year of college. It all started when I asked the question: What if a ghost made someone draw a dick on a board in front of all their classmates? Then I laughed because I thought the image was super funny. How I got to the full story I couldn't tell ya. But I recently graduated college and I finally have time to make this thing. Before I go into the ""real world"" and get an entry level job in showbiz where all my time will be spent slaving for some exec, I want to make something that is MINE, where I'm the creative head and I am my own boss. I want to be a Showrunner in the future so your contributions will allow me to get a head start on that and bring my daydream of ghosts forcing a kid to draw a dick on a blackboard come to fruition. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for $4500 to fund two episodes that will serve as proof of concept on our larger Indiegogo campaign that we will launch at the end of April that will have a goal of $25,000. The funds will be split between the two episodes. Most of the money will be going to makeup, costume, and special effects. I (Ameerah) have a personal belief system that ARTISTS DESERVE TO BE PAID. So factored into the budget is payment for our producers, actors, and head of departments. Most of our crew will be young college kids and those of them that are soon to enter the enterainment biz deserve some pennies for thier trouble don't you think?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ghost Town will obviously focus on death. As someone with a very dark sense if humor I’ve always found death to be a little hilarious. However I am aware that this is a very real subject, mortality. Ghost Town aims to look death in the face and smile about it. Suicide, depression and grief are all explored within Ghost Town but also issues of life. Death is scary but Life is hard. Kevin and his friends bond over Life and the struggles of getting through it. For those that struggle through life, which is everyone, I think this series will be one of those shows you can point to when you talk to your friends at 3am and say “that’s how it feels” and be understood.</p>
<p>There is also a theme of self acceptance that is unique to Kevin’s arch. Kevin is Chinese American and although being  Guide is not unique to Chinese people in this universe, his ability link him to his grandmother and the rest of his family line who have had this gift. It draws him back to his family and an aspect of himself that he struggles to accept. So there is a general element of self-acceptance but also the embracing of heritage and culture from the perspective of a person of color in America.</p>
<p>And the show is just gonna be a laugh.</p>

<h3>Join the Action!</h3>
<p>We're pioneering episodic storytelling and audience participation as an integral part of nonviolent moral direct action to protect our planet from the worst effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Our community is fighting for clean air, fresh water, healthy children and a prosperous future. We're not alone. With the global threat of climate change driven by entrenched commercial and industrial interests, every person on earth faces the same challenges. Most are either in denial, feel powerless, or don't know how to take action and join the fight.</p>
<p>With <i>Our Climate: A Collection Action to Save Our World</i>, we will document the strategies, methods and direct actions we deploy in an asymmetrical struggle against a global, multibillion-dollar corporation. We will capture the drama, intrigue, victories, and setbacks in our uphill battle. Just like in the global climate wars, surrender is not an option. We're all fighting to save our home planet on a tight timeline. The threat to our county is even more imminent.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553988352/x1xxqdfxgomvgd6ploqj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div></div></div>","Join the Action!
We're pioneering episodic storytelling and audience participation as an integral part of nonviolent moral direct action to protect our planet from the worst effects of climate change.
Our community is fighting for clean air, fresh water, healthy children and a prosperous future. We're not alone. With the global threat of climate change driven by entrenched commercial and industrial interests, every person on earth faces the same challenges. Most are either in denial, feel powerless, or don't know how to take action and join the fight.
With Our Climate: A Collection Action to Save Our World, we will document the strategies, methods and direct actions we deploy in an asymmetrical struggle against a global, multibillion-dollar corporation. We will capture the drama, intrigue, victories, and setbacks in our uphill battle. Just like in the global climate wars, surrender is not an option. We're all fighting to save our home planet on a tight timeline. The threat to our county is even more imminent.

While the stakes are high, and the sacrifices are serious, we're a fun-loving, warm and often hilarious community filled with characters you'll want to bring into your life.
Unlike documentaries that are released after the dust has settled, nobody knows the outcome of our struggle. Our audience will follow our actions through Facebook Live and periodic, high-quality episodes on Facebook and YouTube. We will be pitching streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime to reach a broader audience, increase the frequency and improve production values.
We intend to build a global platform that documents the fight for environmental, social and climate justice in communities around the world and right here at home.
Let's Escalate
We're launching a global boycott, divestment campaign and direct actions aimed at preventing the construction of a heavily polluting factory. We'll be disrupting supply chains, targeting distributors and customers, and calling out complicit politicians in the most public ways possible.
Our tactics will span from nonviolent moral direct action in the tradition of MLK and Gandhi, through power-mapping and value-chain leverage to corporate culture-jamming antics. 

This fight could get expensive. While we're a volunteer army, we need transportation, lodging, printing, and online marketing as well as videographers, editors, media relations, court costs, lawyers, and bail money.
We'll be fighting battles in Charleston, WV, our state capital, at the headquarters of our opposition in Denmark, throughout Jefferson County, in Washington, DC, and at trade shows, events and corporate offices across the globe.
We're raising $10,000 for the initial half-hour pilot. The benefit of this approach is that the funding for the pilot and each episode also covers the costs of the direct actions that will be covered! If all goes well, we plan to crowdfund the entire season while also pitching streaming services for a distribution deal.
Contributors will receive amazing perks, include books by leaders of our movement, tickets to the Premier Hoedown, t-shirts, hoodies, stickers and other fan favorites.

If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll use the funds for the next direct actions and do our best to produce high-quality content like the video on this page, and our coverage of the Danish Embassy Action, Senator Manchin Action, Denmark Rally at Town Run and other events for distribution through social media in support of our cause.

<h3>About RxR</h3>
<p>Clarissa and Karisa created this series after undergoing one of the hardest years of their lives. They laughed until they cried and took all those weird, uncomfortable moments and birthed Rylan and Rylee. They both realized they hadn't seen or heard a story like this before. Rather than wait around hoping for it to make it to the screen, they decided to make it themselves. </p>

<h3>Campaign Importance:</h3>
<p>This is a story about two girls who don’t even know how much they need each other until circumstance throws them together and they find out exactly what they need. </p>
<p>Making a project like this takes a lot of ingenuity and persistence. We have been working on this project for three years now and we are finally ready to share it with everybody. BUT we need your help to make the show as great as we know it can be :). In order to pay for the best cast, cinematographers, producers, sound, and crew, we'll need funds beyond our own. This story deserves to be told and we want to have the best team to tell it, which is where YOU come in. </p>
<p>Below, we have outlined exactly what we need help with and where your much appreciated donations will go. The filmmaking process is a costly one and we want to make sure not to cut any corners! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is not going to be the end for Rylan and Rylee! We're hoping to take this webseries and bring it on the festival circuit. We want to get the word out and continue pitching this idea. We've already had some interest from a few production companies based on the idea alone, so the goal would be to show them how great the series could be once produced. YOU could help us make this a reality!</p>
<p>As with any project, this is going to be a learning process for us, but we are confident that we have a story that will touch a lot of people and that is extremely relatable. Yes, it's a cancer story, but it's not a story about cancer. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>This show chronicles the adventures of an unusual crew that must stick together to survive in the hostile world of deep space. Living on a spaceship, their livelihood is the repossession and salvage of other vessels for the mob in the lawless, far reaches of space. Though they initially believe they just have a job to do, they will stumble into the tangled web of a dark mystery with a merciless villain who will stop at nothing to bend the universe to her will.  </p>
<p>In this universe, the earth has long been lost and forgotten, but humans are still the only known intelligent life. Technical advances help humans to extend their life and abilities but can also be misused in their corruptible desire for power.</p>
<p>This world is controlled by the heavy hands of super corporations, a matriarchal political order, a commercialized military division, and mafia. But those in power will soon learn that individual people and their actions still matter and can make a significant influence on humanity.</p>

<p>Our visual world is inspired by golden age science fiction from the 1950s with a slight touch of cyberpunk. With custom designed CGI models, we have outstanding visuals, colors, cinematography, and world designs. All 3D models for the show are uniquely created and stylized in a retro theme. Outfits and makeup are also inspired by the same decade, but with the addition of modern technology. Though effects and settings can be a frequent downfall for independent SciFi productions, the skills and resumes of our production team will create a fantastical masterpiece. </p>
<h3>Technology design in the show</h3>
<p>Our star spaceship is designed to retrofit for towing gear to pull collected ships behind. With additional booster engines constantly being tinkered on and enhanced by our inventive main character, it is equipped to handle the adventures (and the mishaps) that our repo crew may face in space. </p>

</div></div>","The Story

 
This show chronicles the adventures of an unusual crew that must stick together to survive in the hostile world of deep space. Living on a spaceship, their livelihood is the repossession and salvage of other vessels for the mob in the lawless, far reaches of space. Though they initially believe they just have a job to do, they will stumble into the tangled web of a dark mystery with a merciless villain who will stop at nothing to bend the universe to her will.  
In this universe, the earth has long been lost and forgotten, but humans are still the only known intelligent life. Technical advances help humans to extend their life and abilities but can also be misused in their corruptible desire for power.
This world is controlled by the heavy hands of super corporations, a matriarchal political order, a commercialized military division, and mafia. But those in power will soon learn that individual people and their actions still matter and can make a significant influence on humanity.

 
Stylization and art

Our visual world is inspired by golden age science fiction from the 1950s with a slight touch of cyberpunk. With custom designed CGI models, we have outstanding visuals, colors, cinematography, and world designs. All 3D models for the show are uniquely created and stylized in a retro theme. Outfits and makeup are also inspired by the same decade, but with the addition of modern technology. Though effects and settings can be a frequent downfall for independent SciFi productions, the skills and resumes of our production team will create a fantastical masterpiece. 
Technology design in the show
Our star spaceship is designed to retrofit for towing gear to pull collected ships behind. With additional booster engines constantly being tinkered on and enhanced by our inventive main character, it is equipped to handle the adventures (and the mishaps) that our repo crew may face in space. 

Inspired by 1950s industrial design, we merge current and predicted technologies to create our look. Below are a gravitational ray gun, a service robot, and more unique models, characters and scenes.

This is a universe filled with retro style rockets, robots and others elements. Each has it is own character, it is own story.

 
Locations

We have CG created environments, designed and developed by award-winning, published artists. Most model assets are created in Cinema 4D. Our stunning digital environments are developed with World Machine, Vue and Terragen. They are filmed on a green screen with compositing in After Effects and Premiere Pro. Full workflow involves many steps and many different applications to achieve the desired result.

 
Characters and the Actors that Play Them

The script is rich with interesting, dynamic characters. From Oz, the rogue-ish and innovative ship's captain to Brigette, a formerly enslaved computer whiz with a dangerous secret. All of our actors are familiar with the main scripts, however, the characters' life stories, with their goals, hopes, and secrets will not always be shared between them.  Actors will be living the story as it is progressing and the resulting dynamics and discoveries will make their interactions compelling and believable in a whole new way.

Some of us even wound up homeless. Flash forward to Fall 2020: a plan is formed by a collective of such artists, (henceforth known as Chez Poulet Productions), in an attempt to keep working & providing. But how to adapt to a now entirely digital medium? What to create in order to keep entertaining audiences? How can we remind ourselves and each other to keep fighting for a better tomorrow?""I have no idea where I am going to be tomorrow, but I accept the fact tomorrow will come. And I'm going to rise to meet it."" - Donna Troy The League of Extraordinary Gentlepeople (L.E.G.P.) is a fictional web series about a team of Canadian Super Heroes, (not Alpha Flight ;) and the first creative content produced by Chez Poulet Productions.Chronicling the formation of ""The League,"" the nine-episode series follows a group of ordinary citizens, as they struggle to navigate the socioeconomic, psychological, and ethical challenges of the pandemic and their city's sinister past. All while keeping their tights laundered.We at Chez Poulet Productions are seeking to raise enough funds to produce our first major project, The L.E.G.P.,  to be released in Spring 2021.   You can help our heroes save the city.

And we'll all get through this together.            ""Life doesn't give us purpose. We give life purpose."" - The Flash.Our team was born to create great content. Check out our bios and you'll see. What we're asking is the means to get it out of our minds and into your hands, er, screens.Your donation provides us with everything a creative studio needs: Cameras, Costumes, Lighting, the stuff we can't get for free, etc...  Plus the aid from the pros where we need it most. Like social media and sponsorship.We even have a profit share model in place to pay as many people as possible. The larger the amount raised, the more we'll be able to help so many of the unemployed.The more we make, the more awesome we can make The L.E.G.P.          ""If there is nothing but what we make in this world... Let us make good."" - Beta Ray BillDonate & Pledge - Donating to our campaign is the best and most effective way to contribute.

<p>Most sports related videos or documentaries amount to little more than extended promos. We want to avoid the typical flair and cliches that many of these sport documentaries find themselves repeating endlessly. It is not our goal to only tell stories about people running impressive times or races. Rather, it is the runner's lifestyle itself that we want to focus on, and how it manifests differently for different runners - the struggle to balance one's running life with one's ""civilian life"". We hope that while following the lives of these different runners we will be able to explore larger socio-political issues that relate to American culture as a whole.</p>

We Run New York is a documentary-series focusing on the different running groups and/or individuals within New York City’s diverse running scene.  Our goal is to highlight the more humble and unassuming qualities of each episode’s subject matter, e.g. the daily routine and struggle of a runner in an environment inhospitable to one, rather than focusing on just flashy success stories.  More than anything else, it is the humanity of running that we want to examine, and explore the different reasons people are drawn to running.
The Crew

Director/Editor/DP: Harry McFann ran track and studied film at Columbia University.  While there, he ran a personal best of 1:47 in the 800, was an All-American, and won multiple conference titles.  He is based in New York City, and continues to be part of the running community there.  As a freelance videographer he has worked on projects ranging from pieces for The Yes Network to promotional material for a Broadway show.  
Producer/Creator: Paul Snyder is a freelance writer, currently living in Flagstaff, Arizona, but with every intention to relocate back to the City in a year's time. His work's been featured in Running Times and Meter Magazine, and he's currently a staff writer for Citius Mag. He was teammates with Harry at Columbia, but was much slower. He loves writing about New York and running, and has been wanting to work on a project like this one for years.

Additional Photography: Gus Reed and Harry have worked on numerous projects together over the years.  A videographer specializing in dance, he has created video for organizations including Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, New York City Ballet Education, and The George Balanchine Foundation.   

Music Composer: Vincent Oppido holds a BA and MM in Music from George Mason University in Fairfax, VA, and a Graduate Certificate in Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television from The University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.  Vinny has scored numerous films, some of which have screened at film festivals around the world, including Charlie Joe’s Hotel Motel (Hollywood Film Festival and Madrid International Film Festival - nominated for Best Short Film), Cineastes (Greek Film Festival), and Lovely Day (Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival), Panofsky’s Complaint (winner of Best Score in ‘Los Angeles Cinema Festival of Hollywood’).

This is evidenced by the juggernauts Anheuser-Busch, MillerCoors, and Heineken [which composed of 90% of the total beer market in the 2000s] experiencing steep declines, yet brewery jobs are at an all-time high. People are drawn to craft breweries because of their commitment to higher quality ingredients, unique flavor profiles, and because they all begin the same way - as a labor of love. This makes for a great story and a better community. </p><p>Crafted is celebrating these brave brewers by showcasing not only their brews but their stories on a national level so they can reach a broader audience. Each season features four different breweries from one region. At the end of each season, these four breweries come together to create one collaborative beer, available in 4-packs of 16oz cans, that viewers can buy at each featured brewery or directly online from crafted-culture.com. We hope that by bringing these stories and their inspired brews into the living rooms of enthusiasts everywhere that we can foster a collaborative and community crafted culture. </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FOUNDERS</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Craig Chapman - Producer &amp; CEO</p><p>Craig has 20 years of experience in New York as a production manager working for MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, Logo, and more.

This is evidenced by the juggernauts Anheuser-Busch, MillerCoors, and Heineken [which composed of 90% of the total beer market in the 2000s] experiencing steep declines, yet brewery jobs are at an all-time high. People are drawn to craft breweries because of their commitment to higher quality ingredients, unique flavor profiles, and because they all begin the same way - as a labor of love. This makes for a great story and a better community. Crafted is celebrating these brave brewers by showcasing not only their brews but their stories on a national level so they can reach a broader audience. Each season features four different breweries from one region. At the end of each season, these four breweries come together to create one collaborative beer, available in 4-packs of 16oz cans, that viewers can buy at each featured brewery or directly online from crafted-culture.com. We hope that by bringing these stories and their inspired brews into the living rooms of enthusiasts everywhere that we can foster a collaborative and community crafted culture.  FOUNDERS Craig Chapman - Producer & CEOCraig has 20 years of experience in New York as a production manager working for MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, Logo, and more. He currently produces Crafted, a series on Amazon Prime. Christopher Berger - COOChris has a decade of experience in the food and beverage industry educating patrons on brewing styles, locations, and ingredients in craft beer. Additionally, he has 5 years of experience in commercial sales and marketing. MISSIONCrafted is revolutionizing the way people can experience and try new craft beers from breweries all over the country.

Though the main characters dealt with being bullied on a daily basis and handled it in their own way, from self harm, to anger and isolation, they had each other to lean on. I wanted to ask the question, if two high school friends who have been humiliated for years suddenly had the power to strike back at their tormentors, a question I pondered ever since I graduated high school. I wrote the characters with passion for I was once them and suffered the same humiliation as they did.  </p>

<h3>Amazing Perks<br/>(things we give you to say 'thanks!' for your support)</h3>
<p>Over here at Lah-Lah HQ, we have been having such a great time thinking up ways to be grateful. Grateful to you that is! So we've designed a range of very <i>Stripy</i> things from postcards and planners to goody bags and personalized songs &amp; messages from Lah-Lah. And then, for the <i>Super Stripes</i> among you (yes, we know you're out there... it's OK to love a kids band even when you're all grown up!) we have some truly amazing experiences including an intimate High Tea Party with Lah-Lah &amp; Buzz, tickets to an exclusive series screening event or even dancing in an official Lah-Lah video clip as part of the series!

And gee, it's September already ... that's almost Christmas...</p>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>Lah-Lah Productions is in planning to produce a new broadcast series - <i>The Stripy Sock Club</i> - featuring the beloved characters of the <i>Lah-Lah's Adventures </i>preschool TV show, and are launching this Indiegogo campaign to fund just the $300,000 gap in the show's $1M production budget. There's a gap because it's getting harder and harder to fund <i>quality</i> pre-school content with less broadcasters making local shows and budget cuts to our beloved national broadcaster and screen funding bodies. But we're not giving in :)</p>
<p><strong>What Is The Stripy Sock Club?</strong><br/>The Stripy Sock Club is the club to join for every girl and boy. Meet new musical friends and their fascinating instruments in each episode. Join Lah-Lah and her adorable band of quirky and fun loving musicians as they do their best to work as a team, make great music, discover fascinating instruments from around the world and find new club members. So grab your stripes and join the club!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535008068/is7tq1b7cuagvmv5yepv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Stripy Sock Clubhouse</strong><br/>The Stripy Sock Clubhouse is quaint and homely - and is shaped like a giant stripy sock! It is nestled between lush rolling green hills. The sock's cuff has a small pitched slate roof, there are cute square windows and a large hobbit hole-like door at the sock’s ankle. At the back of the heel there is a flight of cute wooden stairs with banister leading inside.</p>

<p><strong>The Music</strong><br/>Lah-Lah is a band and they love to play songs, so every episode features a new Lah-Lah original. The songs are great fun for the kids at home to sing, dance and play along with. Every song has been specially crafted include to highlight early childhood music learnings such as high/low (pitch), fast/slow (tempo), loud/soft (dynamics), stop/go (notes &amp; rests). They do so across a broad palette of musical styles from around the globe including Latin, jazz, Gypsy, klezmer, rock'n'roll, pop and a touch of classical.</p>
<p><strong>The Musical Guests</strong><br/>The guests are a showcase of Australia’s rich and diverse musical landscape, including both traditional orchestral instruments such as harp and tuba, as well as lesser known world music instruments such as the <i>oud</i> and <i>charango</i>. The musicians themselves are as colourful and diverse as the instruments they play. Children are also daily visitors to the Stripy Sock Club where they enjoy a voyage of musical discovery with Lah-Lah.</p>

<p>Lah-Lah is Australia’s premiere band for young children, performing original Australian songs influenced by a diverse palette of musical genres. Since formation ten years ago Lah-Lah has proven to be a hit with families with its annual national tour and international broadcast platform culminating to date in two Australian Clubs Entertainment (ACE) awards for Best Children’s Show and a 2017 ARIA nomination for Best Children’s Album. In 2018 Lah-Lah was inducted into the What's On 4 Kids Hall Of Fame. The cast are all leading musicians and performers in their own right and each has their own adorably quirky character in the band.</p>
<p>Lah-Lah has been making screen content for almost ten years, beginning with a series of music videos co-produced with Nickelodeon Australia in 2009, broadcasting first on Nick Jr. and more recently on ABC KIDS in Australia. In 2013 Lah-Lah, with production companies Stella Projects in Australia and Bardel Entertainment in Canada, made the series <i>Lah-Lah's Adventures</i> for BBC Australia, Seven Network and the Canadian networks BBC Canada and the Knowledge Network. <i>Lah-Lah's Adventures</i> is now also broadcast on Virgin Media in the UK and NBC Universal's kids channel Universal Kids across the USA. More recently Lah-Lah has begun producing regular online video content in-house including music videos and music education resources. The Australian Children's Television Foundation has also recently licensed <i>Lah-Lah's Adventures</i> to create a series of music education resources for primary schools.</p>
<p>The Stripy Sock Club is our <i>love</i> project. We have been developing and refining the show's format over the past three years, which has then dovetailed perfectly into the timing of an industry first partnership with the wonderful RMIT University to use their brand new state of the art studios in Melbourne.</p>
<p>After our exciting test shoot there earlier this year, we are now ready to take The Stripy Sock Club to the screen and we need your help to make this happen. For us, crowdfunding is the perfect way to engage directly with you, our Lah-Lah fans both in Australia and around the world. We want to invite <i>you</i> to join <i>us</i> and be a part of the Stripy Sock Club's journey (and get some really cool exclusive goodies to you along the way)!</p>

<h3>How will the funds be used?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534985798/uyjrmean9exhqmbz8pn6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Stripy Sock Club will be a technically groundbreaking production using the cutting edge in virtual studio techniques. Through our unique partnership with RMIT University in Melbourne, the series will be shot in a brand new state-of-the-art 'virtual set' studio. The specially designed cameras integrate with <i>Zero Density</i> software to allow us to composite the live action band into incredibly photorealistic 3D virtual sets modelled in the video game industry's <i>Unreal Engine 4</i> in real time. With the musical calibre of Lah-Lah combined with the technology of RMIT's studio, The Stripy Sock Club will sound magnificent, look amazing <i>and </i>we won't have to spend months and months in post production - we can get the new show to you quicker!</p>
<p>We need your support to bring The Stripy Sock Club to life. The funds you give, when you choose your exclusive perks, play a key part in closing the gap in the production budget. Your contribution will help us to make the most of this incredible technology with the best creative - scripts, designs, 3D modelling, music and musician guests.</p>

<p>We were recently awarded development funding by the Australian Children's Television Foundation (ACTF). With this, took the Lah-Lah's Big Live Band to the new RMIT University studio to test out the technology using one 3D modelled Stripy Sock Club environment. The results are amazing and we hope you are as excited as we are - have a look:</p>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise the full $300,000 production budget gap to allow us to produce a 26 x seven-minute episode series of The Stripy Sock Club for broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>But what happens if you don't raise the whole goal amount?</strong><br/>It's simple. We'll make as many episodes as we can with whatever we raise. We're committed to producing this show in January-February 2019.</p>

<p>The Australian Government is currently undertaking a review of Australian and children's screen content. In response, the free to air commercial television broadcasters are lobbying to have their obligation to present quotas of new Australian children's programming scrapped. Preschool producers are already in a difficult position as their content doesn't attract anywhere near the licence fees from broadcasters that adult content does. Should these broadcasters be successful, the amount of quality children's content produced by Australians for Australians will dangerously decline as the newer online broadcasters don't currently have any obligation to program new Australian content either. This will put strong downward pressure on the quality of local children's shows, damaging the public's opinion the industry and profoundly short-changing our kids in the most important stage of their identity development.</p>

<p>A lot of preschool content on Australian screens now consists of animated shows from overseas, with funding tied to the potential for revenue from toy sales. As our show focuses on making music, we don’t really have funding coming in from toy licensing. Funding for a show like ours comes from broadcaster license fees - which are getting smaller all the time, government funding - which is getting harder to access, and angel investors - who demand large chunks of profits and merchandising rights. Therefore, we’ve chosen to tread this completely new funding path with you and Indiegogo.</p>
<p>We are now in the middle of their 10<sup>th</sup> Birthday Party national tour around Australia and strongly believe that this crowdfunding campaign will allow Australian mums and dads to have a voice in the type of TV content they want their kids watching. A successful campaign will give hard proof to government and broadcasters that parents want shows such as this that are not only entertaining and educational, but also uniquely Australian.</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p>We're starting to receive some great questions regarding our show and the campaign, so below I'll be adding the most common questions with our thoughts. So please, leave a comment above in the campaign, we'll reply to everyone and this section can become more helpful for all. Please click the arrows to read the answers to the questions.</p>
<details><summary><strong>why is the ABC not funding this? Isn't that what our tax goes towards? Why does your show need to be crowdfunded when clearly you're bringing money to the ABC in terms of loyal viewers etc? (thanks to Tanya M)</strong></summary><p><br/>Lah-Lah is an independent production company that makes TV, online video, music and live concerts and merchandise products. We are a small family business run by Tina (Lah-Lah) and Mark (Buzz) with just two other wonderful staff. We manage all our live touring, promotion, music production and merchandising in house and, in 2013, worked with two other independent production companies – Stella Projects (Australia) and Bardel Entertainment (Canada) to co-produce Lah-Lah’s Adventures. The ABC, while we love them, actually has very little to do with Lah-Lah other than having bought a license to broadcast our show on ABC TV and iView for the last few years.</p>
<p>ABC KIDS gets its content for broadcast in a few ways. Firstly, they produce their own preschool content, namely Playschool and Giggle and Hoot. Then they commission a very small number of shows from independent producers. Commissioning is a system where they get creative input in the development of a new show and often have some equity position in it, for this they have to contribute quite a lot to the total production budget, perhaps 30%, they don’t pay for the entire production. The ABC funding cuts have meant that the budget for commissioning new Australian preschool shows is tiny. We understand that they would dearly love to be able to commission more content for kids, but unfortunately, it’s just not the reality they face. Finally, The ABC acquires broadcast licenses, at very very low cost (in our case it could be 2-3% of the total production budget) for shows that have already been made. This is one of the the main ways that the ABC is getting new preschool content for the channel and how <i>Lah-Lah’s Adventures</i> came to the ABC (the show was actually commissioned by BBC Australia and the Seven Network). Producers accept this in part because they have no choice, with little other broadcaster competition in Australia there are few places to sell our shows to, but also because many of the other productions – mostly animated – can be dubbed into foreign languages and sold to hundreds of other territories, helping to recoup the budget, or by commercialising the characters into licensing properties sold to toy companies. Our issues here are a) as a live action show for pre-schoolers, our content is not suitable to be dubbed into foreign languages for preschools – this is a common position of international broadcasters - and b) as we focus on music and instruments and getting kids participating in music making, we are less focused on licensing to toy companies than we are to making great music and shows for kids. Furthermore, the free-to-air commercial broadcasters are currently actively campaigning to have their Australian children’s content quotas scrapped entirely, which removes even more sales opportunities from us producers.</p>
<p>The total production budget for The Stripy Sock Club is much more than the $300,000 we are aiming to raise here from our audience - making high quality screen content is very very expensive - however we are seeking other funding sources to bring the show to life including broadcast license sales to free-to-air, pay TV and streaming broadcasters in Australia and international English speaking territories as well as government funding initiatives from Create NSW, Film Victoria and Screen Australia and investment in the series from players in the industry. In short, it takes a community to make a show and that’s why we are asking you to help.</p>
<p> </p></details><details><summary><strong>What's the best way for me to help you grow the campaign after I've contributed?</strong></summary><p><br/>Comment and share!</p>
<p>Indiegogo is, like so many web platforms these days, run by algorithms that track lots of metrics to decide who to support further. Indiegogo's business depends on campaigns going well, so it actively promotes the more successful ones. They have a number of tools for you to help us, including the comment sections on our campaign page and the share buttons at the top right. Use of these features is tracked by the platform and goes towards something they call <i>GoGoFactor</i>, which is how they gauge which campaigns to promote. So please, <strong>comment &amp; share :)</strong></p>
<p> </p></details><details><summary><strong>How much will it really cost to make the show?</strong></summary><p>Making high quality screen content costs <strong>a lot!</strong> There are just so many people and so much equipment to make it look any good.</p>
<p>Some examples are based on what our federal screen financing body Screen Australia expects in commissioning rates from broadcasters. To apply for general TV production funding for example, a show must have attracted $440,000 per hour of content from a broadcaster. Doing some quick maths, that means that for a show that has a typical 13 x 30-minute episodes in its season, they’d need to secure almost $2.9 million from a broadcaster to even be eligible to apply for extra funding. That they’d need to apply for extra funding indicates that $2.9M isn’t enough to cover production costs, with Screen Australia funding up to an extra $2M on this kind of project. So, the production budget could be <i>at least</i> $4.9M (and very likely considerably more).</p>
<p>By contrast, our first show <i>Lah-Lah’s Adventures</i> had a production budget of close to $2M for its 26 x 12-minute episodes, which is a really low budget by comparison. With some technological advancements that we are being invited to use at RMIT and working on a shoestring, we’re aiming to keep The Stripy Sock Club’s 26 x 7-minute episode budget to just under $1M.</p>
<p>We are funding the difference between that budget total and your wonderful contributions by applying to government screen funding bodies, seeking investment from the industry, and entering into an industry first partnership with RMIT University – allowing us to use their facilities and equipment in return for giving their students an invaluable opportunity to work on a for-broadcast show as part of their studies.</p>

Project Overview
Lah-Lah Productions is in planning to produce a new broadcast series - The Stripy Sock Club - featuring the beloved characters of the Lah-Lah's Adventures preschool TV show, and are launching this Indiegogo campaign to fund just the $300,000 gap in the show's $1M production budget. There's a gap because it's getting harder and harder to fund quality pre-school content with less broadcasters making local shows and budget cuts to our beloved national broadcaster and screen funding bodies. But we're not giving in :)
What Is The Stripy Sock Club?The Stripy Sock Club is the club to join for every girl and boy. Meet new musical friends and their fascinating instruments in each episode. Join Lah-Lah and her adorable band of quirky and fun loving musicians as they do their best to work as a team, make great music, discover fascinating instruments from around the world and find new club members. So grab your stripes and join the club!

The Stripy Sock ClubhouseThe Stripy Sock Clubhouse is quaint and homely - and is shaped like a giant stripy sock! It is nestled between lush rolling green hills. The sock's cuff has a small pitched slate roof, there are cute square windows and a large hobbit hole-like door at the sock’s ankle. At the back of the heel there is a flight of cute wooden stairs with banister leading inside.

The MusicLah-Lah is a band and they love to play songs, so every episode features a new Lah-Lah original. The songs are great fun for the kids at home to sing, dance and play along with. Every song has been specially crafted include to highlight early childhood music learnings such as high/low (pitch), fast/slow (tempo), loud/soft (dynamics), stop/go (notes & rests). They do so across a broad palette of musical styles from around the globe including Latin, jazz, Gypsy, klezmer, rock'n'roll, pop and a touch of classical.
The Musical GuestsThe guests are a showcase of Australia’s rich and diverse musical landscape, including both traditional orchestral instruments such as harp and tuba, as well as lesser known world music instruments such as the oud and charango. The musicians themselves are as colourful and diverse as the instruments they play. Children are also daily visitors to the Stripy Sock Club where they enjoy a voyage of musical discovery with Lah-Lah.
Background

Lah-Lah is Australia’s premiere band for young children, performing original Australian songs influenced by a diverse palette of musical genres. Since formation ten years ago Lah-Lah has proven to be a hit with families with its annual national tour and international broadcast platform culminating to date in two Australian Clubs Entertainment (ACE) awards for Best Children’s Show and a 2017 ARIA nomination for Best Children’s Album. In 2018 Lah-Lah was inducted into the What's On 4 Kids Hall Of Fame. The cast are all leading musicians and performers in their own right and each has their own adorably quirky character in the band.
Lah-Lah has been making screen content for almost ten years, beginning with a series of music videos co-produced with Nickelodeon Australia in 2009, broadcasting first on Nick Jr. and more recently on ABC KIDS in Australia. In 2013 Lah-Lah, with production companies Stella Projects in Australia and Bardel Entertainment in Canada, made the series Lah-Lah's Adventures for BBC Australia, Seven Network and the Canadian networks BBC Canada and the Knowledge Network. Lah-Lah's Adventures is now also broadcast on Virgin Media in the UK and NBC Universal's kids channel Universal Kids across the USA. More recently Lah-Lah has begun producing regular online video content in-house including music videos and music education resources. The Australian Children's Television Foundation has also recently licensed Lah-Lah's Adventures to create a series of music education resources for primary schools.
The Stripy Sock Club is our love project. We have been developing and refining the show's format over the past three years, which has then dovetailed perfectly into the timing of an industry first partnership with the wonderful RMIT University to use their brand new state of the art studios in Melbourne.
After our exciting test shoot there earlier this year, we are now ready to take The Stripy Sock Club to the screen and we need your help to make this happen. For us, crowdfunding is the perfect way to engage directly with you, our Lah-Lah fans both in Australia and around the world. We want to invite you to join us and be a part of the Stripy Sock Club's journey (and get some really cool exclusive goodies to you along the way)!

How will the funds be used?

The Stripy Sock Club will be a technically groundbreaking production using the cutting edge in virtual studio techniques. Through our unique partnership with RMIT University in Melbourne, the series will be shot in a brand new state-of-the-art 'virtual set' studio. The specially designed cameras integrate with Zero Density software to allow us to composite the live action band into incredibly photorealistic 3D virtual sets modelled in the video game industry's Unreal Engine 4 in real time. With the musical calibre of Lah-Lah combined with the technology of RMIT's studio, The Stripy Sock Club will sound magnificent, look amazing and we won't have to spend months and months in post production - we can get the new show to you quicker!
We need your support to bring The Stripy Sock Club to life. The funds you give, when you choose your exclusive perks, play a key part in closing the gap in the production budget. Your contribution will help us to make the most of this incredible technology with the best creative - scripts, designs, 3D modelling, music and musician guests.

We were recently awarded development funding by the Australian Children's Television Foundation (ACTF). With this, took the Lah-Lah's Big Live Band to the new RMIT University studio to test out the technology using one 3D modelled Stripy Sock Club environment. The results are amazing and we hope you are as excited as we are - have a look:


 

Our Goal
Our goal is to raise the full $300,000 production budget gap to allow us to produce a 26 x seven-minute episode series of The Stripy Sock Club for broadcast.
But what happens if you don't raise the whole goal amount?It's simple. We'll make as many episodes as we can with whatever we raise. We're committed to producing this show in January-February 2019.

Through participation in this campaign, I want those participating to feel involved in the production of this web series because you truly are a part of history in the making for a more diverse Hollywood and one where women are represented in strong roles! The PlotTwo half-sisters, Cassidy and Joanna, who want nothing to do with each other find themselves forced into a union to find their father Michael (Mike) Delofante, a detective who has gone missing. Joanna, trained by a sensai, followed in her father's footsteps and became a cop but, after uncovering suspicious evidence involving her father, hunts down Cassidy to solicit aid in her search to find answers. Cassidy, who was raised on the street, is heavily involved in the underground fighting scene and Joanna believes that Cassidy may be the link to finding their father. Cassidy and Joanna will find themselves on a twin collision course to find their father, and discover a secret that may undo the threads of truth and the very world around them.   What We Need to Wrap Episodes One and Two with an Early 2018 release & What You Get For the total budget goal of $12,500 in the next 60 days, definitely achievable when all who want to see stronger roles for women in the industry and more diversity throughout Hollywood, ""cast their vote"" by contributing at the level comfortable for them to allow for the completion of the first three episodes.Your contributions in helping us meet this goal mean that episodes one and two will be completed in terms of post production, allowing for an early 2018 release of  this web series.  In terms of incentives, we wanted to make it exciting for all who participate and we think we have achieved that!

Allie & Lara just want to see their first epic creature feature WOMANTIS make it to the big screen, but all the Dude Bros and hard NO’s are really holding them back. The solution? They are going to make it themselves! 
If you’d like watching a Langoliers style plane-wreck in slow motion, then this is the series for you!

Alicia & Larissa met in the spring of 2016 and have been joined at the hip ever since, preparing for the wide birth of their creative baby.
They conceived ALLIE & LARA MAKE A HORROR MOVIE last summer, incubated it to full term and are ready to start pushing it out there into the world!
This is first project they have in production, with two more in the development phase.

<h3>Dr. Juli Returns!</h3>
<p>Dr. Julianna Grimaldi is a world renowned expert on anything and everything, with an answer for every question.  As veritable fountain of knowledge, Dr. Juli is tasked with providing simple, everyday answers to many of life's most challenging queries, such as why men think their farts are funny, why reading the comments section kills your brain cells, and why people who are drunk think they're <i>all that</i>.    <br/><i>            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486371453/k5q4nbyqzqbd6y9iddak.jpg"" src=""""/></i><br/><br/>                                               Check out <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/JuliannaGrimaldi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ask Dr Juli on Facebook</a></p>
<p><i>Ask Dr. Juli </i>stars Lana Gautier as the title character and is written by Ron L. Palmer.  We're the ones heading up this campaign and we're excited about bringing this show back.  During season one, we made a lot out of a little, using money from our own pockets to fund the show.   It was a labor of love and we didn't mind it, but now for season two we'd like to take it to the next level.   All twelve season two episodes have been written and we've got loftier goals for locations and casting.  In short, we want season two of <i>Ask Dr. Juli</i> to be special!</p>
<p><br/>That's where <strong>you</strong> come in.  We're creating a special campaign that puts you right in the heart of the project and gives you a stake in it as well.   Want to be an associate producer?  We can do that.  How about impressing your friends and co-workers as an Executive Producer!  Yup, we can make that happen.  Want to have a walk-on role in an episode?  We've got one written for you already.  Those are just some of the perks available to you.  Keep reading to find out more!  </p>

<h3>Get in on the Action!</h3>
<p>Let's get straight to the point... producing any type of entertainment content is expensive, whether it's a feature film, television show or a web series.   In order to bring season two of <i>Ask Dr. Juli </i>to life, we've budgeted $2,000 per episode.  With twelve episodes planned, that's a total of $24,000.   And that's doing it <strong>on a shoestring budget!   </strong>If we reach our goal, that amount will ensure that everybody who works on the series -- actors, crew members, support staff, etc -- will get paid.  If we raise more than our goal, we'll increase the budget and compensate everyone at a higher rate.  We'll also be able to increase the production quality of the series.   It'll look better, sound better and we'll have a better overall product.  Some elements that would otherwise be logistically unaffordable would now be doable.   Bottom line, whatever money is brought in through this campaign will be put into the production and promotion of the project.  On top of that, <strong>you'll be helping create jobs!</strong><br/>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486366846/ngppxtbd9id6vwtcjiq0.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>By now you're probably asking, ""what's in it for me?""   This is not an ordinary crowdfunding campaign where you'll get a hat, a t-shirt or a metaphorical pat on the back.   You have a chance to get your name -- and even your face -- attached to this project in one of many way.  Those perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Associate Producer or Executive Producer credit</li>
<li>Have a character named after you (or a friend)</li>
<li>Have your name listed on a question sent to Dr. Juli</li>
<li>Have your business name mentioned in an episode</li>
<li>Attend the red carpet gala as a VIP!</li>
<li>Actually be in an episode!  With lines!</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just some of the amazing items your contribution to the project could net you.  We'll have a lot more for you to choose from, but having your name attached to the project and celebrating with the cast and crew at the red carpet screening are among the enticing offers you can peruse.  </p>
<p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486367660/rahwwcuqhwoury6kbxad.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Just the Beginning!</h3>
<p>We accomplished a lot with season one of Ask Dr. Juli, providing clever, intelligent humor for those who appreciate not having their comedy spoon fed to them.   Each episode featured interesting and hilarious characters, most of which are slated to be back in season two!  During season one, we assembled a large cast, shot and edited each episode, and spent countless hours promoting the show.   We did so much with so little... just imagine what we could do with a legitimate budget to work with! </p>
<p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486368968/cokku8hkbavudu6r2gqj.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>Here's what you can take away from this:  You'll be with us on the ground floor (well, technically the second floor) as we create this and other projects.   If you've ever wanted a taste of the Hollywood lifestyle, this is your chance to grab a piece of that.   Imagine if someone had offered you a chance to help get <i>Seinfeld</i> off the ground?  How cool would that be to say you were a part of that?    We don't know if <i>Ask Dr. Juli </i>-- or any of our other subsequent projects -- will ever be <i>Seinfeld</i>-big  (or even <i>Joanie Loves Chachi</i>-big), but we're certain that if we don't bust our rumps to make it happen, it never will.    Come along with us on this ride,  and it could very well be the thrill of a lifetime! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Get Caught up on Season One!</h3>
<p>At this point, I guess we probably shouldn't have assumed that you're familiar with Ask Dr. Juli.  If you're not, that's okay.   Our fan base is extremely loyal, but it's small.  They appreciate intelligent, sophisticated humor, but aren't big ""sharers"" on social media.   You can learn more about the program by checking out the <i>Ask Dr. Juli </i>website, linked below.  That's another thing we did ourselves with a limited budget!<br/><br/><strong><a href=""http://askdrjuli.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here to check out the official <i>Ask Dr. Juli </i>website!</a></strong></p>

<p>Even if you can't contribute -- we get it, you've got bills to pay and mouths to feed -- there are things you can do to help the cause.   Please share this campaign with anyone you think might like to be a part if season two.    And please be descriptive -- don't just just click ""share"" on Facebook and be done with it.  Write something when you share it, explaining why you think your friends, family and colleagues might be interested.  Think about it -- how many social media posts have you ignored simply because the person who shared it didn't bother to say anything about it?    You don't have to do anything, really, but whatever you can do to help bring season two of <i>Ask Dr. Juli</i> to life would be greatly appreciated.  <br/>            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486371048/lchrd9qnzcjvanzetzuv.jpg"" src=""""/>​<br/><br/>Still not convinced?   That's okay, take some time to think it over -- and by that we mean no more than a few seconds then hastily hit the ""contribute"" button!   But seriously, we're about to embark on another season-long magic carpet ride and we hope you'll want to join us for the fun.  For as little as five dollars, you can live the Hollywood dream (vicariously, of course) and for a few bucks more -- okay <strong><i>several</i></strong> bucks more -- you can physically be a part of this thrill ride!  We hope you'll come along!  </p>

            Ask Dr. Juli is loaded with a cast of colorful characters guaranteed to tickle your funny bone (figuratively, not literally -- although we're not necessarily opposed to making that a perk).  Many of these insanely hilarious folks are slated to return in season two, and we're excited about expanding on their back stories.   You can help keep them alive!

Even if you can't contribute -- we get it, you've got bills to pay and mouths to feed -- there are things you can do to help the cause.   Please share this campaign with anyone you think might like to be a part if season two.    And please be descriptive -- don't just just click ""share"" on Facebook and be done with it.  Write something when you share it, explaining why you think your friends, family and colleagues might be interested.  Think about it -- how many social media posts have you ignored simply because the person who shared it didn't bother to say anything about it?    You don't have to do anything, really, but whatever you can do to help bring season two of Ask Dr. Juli to life would be greatly appreciated.              ​Still not convinced?   That's okay, take some time to think it over -- and by that we mean no more than a few seconds then hastily hit the ""contribute"" button!   But seriously, we're about to embark on another season-long magic carpet ride and we hope you'll want to join us for the fun.  For as little as five dollars, you can live the Hollywood dream (vicariously, of course) and for a few bucks more -- okay several bucks more -- you can physically be a part of this thrill ride!  We hope you'll come along!

After the 2 oldest roommates drunkenly decide to post an ad specifically looking for Black roommates, we discover these perfectly imperfect characters whose cultures blend by living together and experiencing Brazil.In order to showcase the vision for the show, Helena Morgane and co-writer/producer Sophie Duker decided to put together a temporary cast and crew at the beginning of 2017. We thank them for allowing SQÚAD to go from a script to taster scenes essential to crowdfunding!SQÚAD is an ode to women of the African diaspora, where we step away from the African-American representation typically used by default. We aspires to make you laugh (...HARD!) and shift the way we show blackness in the media.  We have an international power team in place to guarantee our campaign hits the marks we need for funding and to ensure season 1's production goes as smoothly as possible!(Left to right)HELENA MORGANE, is the creator of SQÚAD and will star as Taslim. She supervises all aspects of the campaign. She's a multidisciplinary storyteller as well as the creator of the docu-series Kaleidoscope Stories.ANDRESA PINHEIRO NUNES is co-producing and in charge of the research for SQÚAD in her native Brazil. Andresa is also a filmmaker passionate about journalism and the documentary genre.CHAUNTELLE LEWIS is in charge of SQÚAD's social media strategy. Chauntelle is a social media specialist and graphic designer. She's also a member of SXWKS in London.CESAR VALDEZ, is our awesome community manager monitoring our social media. He is also our video editor and owns a production company in Mexico.PRESS PILLAY, is a boutique agency in charge of SQÚAD's PR and branding. YOLA is a West African businesswoman in the making. She went to boarding school then got an Ivy League type of education. She’s in Brazil to develop her business, though she ultimately desires to go back to her home country to advance its economy; she says stuff like ‘Africa is rising’ a lot. Her eyebrows are always on point and she plays loud naija mixes. Yola struggles between being expected/wanting to marry a man soon to start a traditional family, and her ongoing sexual exploration with women. DIANE “D” is an African-American yoga instructor with doula aspirations who’s attempting to be vegan – but failing in secret. Yola and her are besties and have been living in the house the longest. “The ad”is her idea.  D is celibate, very curvy; struggles with it 30% of the time but knows she’s sexy as f**k. She isn’t college educated, only speaks English and is still resisting opening up to other languages. She’s that blackity black woman who talks length about “AFRICA” – but has never actually been there. Diane could not imagine being in a relationship with a non-Black person and is actively hostile to people she deems aren’t “woke” (a word she overuses). TASLIM “Taz” is an Afro-European woman raised by a muslim father and a Christian mother. This is her first time living out of the nest and FAR AWAY, but she’s far from naive. She eats pork, but does ramadan sometimes - often finds an excuse not to. She occasionally drives her roommates crazy with her loud music and food thefts. She will bust random dance moves or invent lyrics in convos. Her instagram following is crazy, she loves to thirst trap every now and then, and is the ultimate plug for a good time. Taslim works in a sex shop but is still trying to find how to best channel her calling.  ROSIE identifies as Afro-Latina. She was raised by a fierce Nuyorican mother (think Rosie Perez). She’s a polyglot. Her father, a very successful Brazilian musician, taught her Portuguese growing up. She’s in Rio to reconnect with her roots. She’s a down-to-earth curious hippie constantly switching jobs because she struggles with her purpose. Rosie’s roommates will probably be her very first experience of sisterhood: she usually has guy friends and her friendship with Aaliyah is on-off.Recurring character:AALIYAH isn’t a roommate but is often around. She’s in the country to pursue a masters or doctorate. She speaks fluent Portuguese, a powerful asset in her environment. She has almost no black friends back home and is used to operating in mostly white spaces. She likes (spending) money, has an elitist side to her and a sugardaddy with whom she blurs the lines of dating. She’s a troubled soul whose stay in Brazil is a chance to explore her identity and independence. Aaliyah is becoming drawn to blackness after spending a life of seeing it as ‘other’.  Crowdfunding is far from being the easiest route to take for creatives and entrepreneurs! That said, we consider it a powerful asset in the way we create and consume Film and TV nowadays.We are choosing crowdfunding as a way to fund our very first season (10 episodes), because we deeply believe in the strength of our concept and know it will open more doors for other forms of funding! We already have 3 episodes written and 7 will be written as soon as wrap our Indiegogo campaign! We paused our creative process to fully dedicate our attention to this step of pre-production.As you'll see, we set our campaign at a minimum of $15,000, but our ACTUAL goal at this stage is to hit $40,000 (or more) to create exactly what we envision. Where will your money go?Here's a chart showing you the breakdown of our budget. All these elements are the reason why $40,000 is our goal, from pre to post-production, budgeting right is how we keep the quality of our content up to par.If we exceed our goal, we'll probably do a few rounds of victory dance, but we'll also be able to invest in festival submissions, get higher end equipment and just overall make sure our final product has the very best sound and image! Exceeding a goal also sends a strong message to potential collaborators!If we end up not reaching our $40,000 goal, the money will remain assigned to SQÚAD 's first season. We would likely use it as leverage when meeting with production companies or use it as a base when start a follow-up campaign to hopefully gather more funds. We are simultaneously looking into different forms of support and crowdfunding is leading the way.By choosing crowdfunding, we are creating a special bond with you, our audience, and making room for creative freedom. This is where you can express and support what YOU want, and what's better than contributing to the change we want to see in the world?!Our expected timeline will be as follows:- Crowdfunding: October - November 2017- Writing of the remaining 7 episodes; December 2017 - February 2018- Scouting and casting: February-March 2018 . We will be choosing between filming in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador de Bahia and start casting locally- Production: April 2018We aim to film our entire season in 4 to 5 weeks.- Post production: May-June 2018- Online release: June or September 2018

<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p>Become a producer of the TV comedy series UNDERCURRENT set in a Minnesota river town that’s a little dark around the edges.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506436651/a2feth3zan3vmz6afkrm.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>In the river town of Confluence, there is a shroud of mystery surrounding an undiscovered treasure buried along the river by Depression Era gangsters.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503428291/zfmefz5iw3hyfigegixh.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>But that’s not all that’s about to get dug up from the past.</p>

No sooner than he has unpacked his bags, Joe is sought out by Marjorie Steen, the newly-elected mayor of Confluence. Marjorie and Joe have a past and she is on a mission to clean up the “dirt” in her town. That fight against the local corruption is bankrolled by a wealthy citizen who wishes to remain anonymous.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503428407/kjiuqp2kgfijebhmkl3a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Joe reluctantly agrees to investigate and brings on two assistants. One is the exuberant Gage Murphy, a self-absorbed actor who is beset by fits of rage.</p>

<h3>The Proposition</h3>
<p>Why is  UNDERCURRENT worth your investment? Because this TV series combines unforgettable comedic characters with drama, mystery and romance that can only happen in a small, nearly-forgotten river town. So, for us to bring UNDERCURRENT up to the surface we need to make more episodes. The pilot is shot and is in post-production. Episode-2 is written and ready to go. So when we ask you to donate, it’s more than just a “call to action...” it’s a call for lights, camera, action!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503429320/uzrknmagju1gtfhxb8px.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The making of this “MNIndie” is a story of it’s own. Cast and crew, some of the finest talent in Minnesota, has worked long days shooting the pilot episode for little or no money because they believe in the show. But that has to change in order for us to put Confluence on the map. That’s where you come in.</p>

</div></div>","The Pitch
Become a producer of the TV comedy series UNDERCURRENT set in a Minnesota river town that’s a little dark around the edges.

The Project
In the river town of Confluence, there is a shroud of mystery surrounding an undiscovered treasure buried along the river by Depression Era gangsters.
But that’s not all that’s about to get dug up from the past.
Joe Samuel, a former big city detective has returned to his hometown to care for his ailing mother. No sooner than he has unpacked his bags, Joe is sought out by Marjorie Steen, the newly-elected mayor of Confluence. Marjorie and Joe have a past and she is on a mission to clean up the “dirt” in her town. That fight against the local corruption is bankrolled by a wealthy citizen who wishes to remain anonymous.
Joe reluctantly agrees to investigate and brings on two assistants. One is the exuberant Gage Murphy, a self-absorbed actor who is beset by fits of rage.

The other is the quirky Pauline Hingis, a former hairdresser turned tech expert.

Soon, this unlikely trio is investigating the shady dealings of local men’s store owner Jimmy Rickman while getting to know all about Confluence’s long-time, openly-dishonest police chief, Larry Spinkter.

The Proposition
Why is  UNDERCURRENT worth your investment? Because this TV series combines unforgettable comedic characters with drama, mystery and romance that can only happen in a small, nearly-forgotten river town. So, for us to bring UNDERCURRENT up to the surface we need to make more episodes. The pilot is shot and is in post-production. Episode-2 is written and ready to go. So when we ask you to donate, it’s more than just a “call to action...” it’s a call for lights, camera, action!

The making of this “MNIndie” is a story of it’s own. Cast and crew, some of the finest talent in Minnesota, has worked long days shooting the pilot episode for little or no money because they believe in the show. But that has to change in order for us to put Confluence on the map. That’s where you come in.

<p>In 2014, we (cofounders <strong>Rob Getzschman</strong> and <strong>Stoney Sharp</strong>)  bought a 1992 television switchboard known as the <strong>Video Toaster</strong>, deemed obsolete by today's standards. Over the next two years, while working day jobs in television production, we scoured eBay, Craigslist and local resources to track down all the components required to realize our dream: <i>a fully functioning obsolete three-camera SD television studio.</i></p>
<p>Why would anyone want this? Two reasons:</p>
<p>1) We have both been producing video since high school, and we've collaborated since 2010, including work for <strong>ABC Freeform, </strong><strong>Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, IFC, MTV, Funny Or Die, UCB, College Humor</strong> and more. We know the difficulty of media production for people at every level of experience, whether the barriers to entry are social, financial, technical, or educational. We wanted to create a place where people could experiment and make media that could be incredible, weird, purposeful, or useless. We wanted anyone who had an idea to be able to try. We wanted a place where<i> creative people could make ambitious, weird, and unwatchable television without any fear of failure.</i></p>
<p>2) <strong>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</strong> effectively killed public access television, where anyone in America could make TV if they wanted to. Public access was a place where the creative fringe could thrive, and that weirdness found its way into the public consciousness in very real and meaningful ways, from Weird Al's hit feature film UHF to Wayne's World to Tim &amp; Eric Awesome Show Great Job. It's our belief that a healthy fringe promotes a healthy mainstream by osmosis. And without public access television mandated by law, we need something in its place. And for Los Angeles,<strong> that something is Highland Park TV</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The purpose of the campaign </h3>
<p>This campaign is intended to fund Highland Park TV for another year. We are completely volunteer-staffed. Our volunteers show up to run cameras, light and direct productions, run the sound board and Video Toaster, and create stuff together like a hive mind. After financing the project out of pocket for four years, we would like to broaden our community participation and support by crowdsourcing our largest expense: the price of rent for 2018. We never charge people to make stuff at HLPtv, and the community has functioned like open-mic television: show up, put your name on a list, and make a show when it's your turn. </p>
<p>What we offer in return is some pretty okay swag: stickers, posters, t-shirts, a VHS collection of our best work, and the chance to make an appearance of your own on some of HLPtv's longest-running shows! See details in the perks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why is HLPtv important? </h3>
<p>It is our feeling that American media has reached ""peak polish"" — that is, there is scarcely a moment in our collective media consciousness that feels authentic, that shows the rough edges of reality, that reveals the hand of the creator. The broadcasting and advertising we see has been polished to death, and our public figures are media trained to the point of inspiring narcolepsy and/or chronic fatigue in our public. At HLPtv, we ""DO IT LIVE"" and leave the rough edges on for everyone to see and appreciate. Our obsolete tech, rough mixes and mistakes are our aesthetic. And after years of being paid to polish things to death, we revel in making stuff that is unquestionably unprepared, off the cuff, and totally authentic. </p>

<p>A play on Drunk History, Drunk HerStory is a web series that highlights the struggles women face on a daily basis, as told by our hilarious HerStory-tellers over a glass of wine (or six). </p>
<h3>Why Do We Need to Tell HerStory</h3>
<p>The issues women face are real, they are unjust, and they are pervasive. They are comprised of moments in the workplace, on dates, online, in the classroom, in the bedroom, in the media and beyond. But we often only get to talk about these ""issues"" when they are, in fact, issues. A serious problem occurring in that moment, prompting people to take sides, shut down, and either stop the constructive dialogue or stop listening.</p>
<p>Our HerStory-tellers are a racially, sexually, religiously diverse group of individuals who identify as women. Our HerStory-tellers imbibe while they tell their comical, relatable, and often cringe-worthy stories of everything from dating in 2018 to their job as a corporate manager.</p>
<p>The desire is not to make light of real issues. The HerStory movement speaks about feminism in a way that is accessible and engaging with the hope that a wide audience will be receptive to our stories. This is an entirely new platform for women to be heard.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need to push the women's movement forward, but we can't do this without you! We are raising $5,000 to fund our series crew, production, and release- supplementing the time and money they have already donated to making Drunk HerStory a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope the Drunk HerStory series becomes a storytelling platform that empowers, educates, and facilitates a community of female ambassadors to change the perception and environment surrounding women’s issues.</p>
<p>We know talking about these things isn't always easy. By sharing them in a casual, fun, intimate environment, we are breaking the barriers around discussing these issues. Women will be sharing with elements of humor and candor, not to lighten the issue, but to emphasize our resilience and strength.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand you may not be able to financially support our cause, but we would still love your support in the Drunk HerStory movement! If you would be willing, please share our crowdfunding page with your own community. It's time to achieve women's equality in a whole new way. Cheers to that!</p>

<p>Justin Antonopoulos, star of the 1998 Christmas favorite ""Rudolph's Return,"" had a hard time coping with his childhood in the spotlight. After years of struggling to escape his Hollywood past, he found solace in Jehovah's Witnesses, a religion whose followers believe the end of the world is imminent and only 144,000 chosen believers will live in heaven after Armageddon.</p>
<p>When the studio announces a 20th anniversary reboot of ""Rudolph's Return,"" Justin's dedication to his new faith is put to the test. Will he become one of the 144,000, or will Rudolph return to destroy him once again?</p>

<h3>Why Should You Trust Us With Your Money?</h3>
<p>We've already filmed two episodes on a tiny budget, but we need more funding if we're going to produce six more with the same level of quality! Here's where your money would be going:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment rentals: because cameras are expensive, like really expensive!</li>
<li>Production Crew: because talented professionals will only volunteer their time for so long!</li>
<li>Locations: because even set dec legend Brittan Smith can't make a small apartment look like a church!</li>
<li>Set dressing, props, and costumes: because we want to keep it looking good, we want to immerse you in the world of The Witness!</li>
<li>Food for the cast and crew: because 12-hour shooting days are no joke and eating is important.</li>
<li>Marketing: because we want the world to hear Justin's story.</li>
