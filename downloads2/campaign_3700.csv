<p>Latitude 53 is Edmonton’s oldest artist run gallery, and we’re celebrating our 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year! We have recently moved into a new location (just next door to the old one) that brings Latitude 53 down to street level. This makes the gallery more visible and more accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Many people are asking <strong>“WHAT ABOUT THE PATIO?!!?11”</strong> – and this campaign is the answer.  Latitude 53 is planning to build a brand new patio out front of the new gallery space that reaches right up to the sidewalk, and this is where all of our patio events will take place.</p>
<p>Some awesome features of the new patio:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s right on street level, so everyone can see when a party is happening. </li>
<li>No stairs! No need to climb up 3 flights of stairs to join the fun.</li>
<li>Garage door access: It will no longer be difficult to move between inside and outside – the new patio will be an extension of the gallery spaces.</li>
</ul><p>The patio is a place for our community to gather, have great conversations, and most importantly it gives everyone the perfect reason to come out and be involved with amazing contemporary art. It is important for Latitude 53 to reinvent this space for the future and this is what we are asking you to help us achieve. </p>
<p>We are looking to raise $3000 or more over the next month in order to help with the costs of having the actual deck built for the patio. Board by board we will build this new space, and we are asking you to be a part of it by making a contribution to this campaign. Every bit makes a difference, and the big reward (besides the perks that you get!) is that there will be a new unique place to hang out in downtown Edmonton.  </p>
<p>We can't wait to see all of you out this summer! The patio series begins on Thursday June 13.</p>
<h3>Don’t forget to link the campaign to all your social networks!</h3>
<h2>The next step...</h2>
<p>We’ve been amazed with the reception to our Patio construction fundraising campaign—not even halfway through, and we’ve already passed $3000—but we think we can do better! If we can raise $6000 with this campaign, we'll be able to stock our bar and kitchen, pour concrete to replace the old, unlevel tiles next to the deck, and make sure the patio is inviting and beautiful in time for the season's start.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’re making plans to start the deck construction soon. Mark your calendar for the first Patio on June 13!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Exploiting the Earth’s resources for energy is part of what humans do. Recently, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies have demonstrated great promise in extracting natural gas from deep underground. These technologies rupture deep rock formations with the high-pressure injection of a mixture of water, sand and chemical additives, liberating the gas within. Fracturing these layers of rock is commonly called Hydrofracking or Fracking. <br/><br/>As with most energy extraction methods, controversy flourishes with hydrofracking. We need the energy… people need jobs &amp; money… there are dangers… humans take shortcuts… tycoons abandon played out sites… etc. Fracking is no different, and has plenty of arguments coming from many perspectives. <br/><br/>Oil City, PA is in the middle of a large shale field being fracked called Marcellus. Because of our geography the local art community felt it was appropriate to invite artists to display their ideas on Fracking. We want art to facilitate a public discourse, and we call the show Frackin’ Art. <br/><br/>We invite work from artists reflecting their view on hydrofracking – the benefits, the dangers, the future, the fears, or any other inspiration. There are many national and international sites where hydrofracking is an issue and artists from any locale are invited.<br/> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>There are a several things that a donation to the Frackin' Art Exhibit will support.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>1)  We'd like to honor three of the entrants (chosen by the exhibit judges) with monetary prizes.  Ideally, we'd like to end up with a minimum of one $250, $150, and $100 cash prizes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2)  We've already been lucky enough to have a local Oil City business negotiate a special arrangement to waive the entry fee ($25) for Oil City artists.  This business believes the Frackin’ Art Exhibit is an important forum for debate over an issue important everyone in Oil City. Their intent is to remove any financial barrier that might interfere with participation from any Oil City artists.  Wouldn't it be great to remove this barrier for all artists?  If enough money is raised, we can waive or lower the fee for everyone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3) We'd love for this to turn into a dialog beyond the actual exhibit, and with enough support we can invite guest speakers/presenters to attend and cover any honorarium/travel fees that might be associated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do you get from supporting Frackin' Art?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p>In addition to our gratitude and showing your support for the arts, we have arranged some incentives for various giving levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$10</strong> - A handwritten thank you card.</p>
<p><strong>$25</strong> - In addition to the above, recognition on our website and exhibit program.</p>
<p><strong>$50</strong> - In addition to the above, recognition on our Facebook page, and a exhibit program. </p>
<p><strong>$100</strong> - In addition to the above, an invitation to a cocktail party with the exhibit curator, guest artists, and other donors (after the opening reception).</p>
<p><strong>$500</strong> -<strong> </strong>In addition to the above, lunch and/or a tour of Oil City with the exhibit curator.<strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't afford a donation?  You can always unleash your inner artist and join the dialog by submitting a piece of art.  Not artistic?  There are other ways you can help!  Spread the word by sharing this with others (both artists and potential funders), and if you are in the Oil City area, make sure you stop by to see the exhibit!</p>

<h3>So what's this all about?</h3>
<p>My nephew, Liam, is severely autistic. It was a hard fact to face when he was diagnosed, but once that obstacle was overcome his family has been dilligently working on giving him a promising future. At 8 1/2 years old he is finally starting to communicate with his family. My sister and her family have been working hard to get him this far, he is finally starting to toilet train and he can - sort of - communicate what he needs. </p>
<p>Liam struggles with unexplainable frustration due to his problems with communicating. He has fits, which thankfully have decreased both in frequency and duration. Despite what life has thrown him,  Liam is happy, sweet, affectionate, and very connected boy, especially with his brother Noah. </p>
<p>Of course we all want more for him.  We want to hear him talk.  Really talk.  I can’t tell you how hard it is to see him upset or incredibly anxious trying to express his needs. More than anything, we all want him to have more options for his future than his current condition allows.  He has a great support team, and he has come a long way, but there’s still a long way to go.   </p>
<p> Since Liam’s diagnosis at 3 ½ my sister and her family have tried many different avenues, from dietary changes (we’re all gluten-free), supplementations, B12 shots, autism conferences, etc. Some with great success, but all at a great cost. They have exhausted their resources entirely. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What do i want and what do you get?</h3>
<p>So this is where I come in. I have always wished I could financially assist my nephew and his family. We do what we can but we know it is not enough. What I do have a lot of on the other hand, is art. I had my art featured at a Universal Studios movie gallery this year, Snow White and The Huntsman. I have a statue in Vancouver Airport, one in the Burnaby Casino, and over 400 peices of artwork sold worldwide. </p>
<p>So in addition to the warm-all-over glowy feeling that you will get from supporting my nephew, you will get the warm glowy feeling of making an excellent art purchase.</p>
<p>I am very much a commercial artist as well as an artsy one, so I am willing to work with YOU to make a custom piece for your home that you love.</p>
<p>I will be giving the proceeds to my sister's family to pay for special therapies, and training and support for Liam that the government can't/won't pay for. After I started this campaign, I got a call from my sister insisting that I don't produce the artwork out of pocket. I use part of the proceeds to pay for the artwork, shipping and some of my time. So the remainder will be going to Liam. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am a roller derby player, derby designer, and artist, and mom. I feel like one of the luckiest people in the world to live the life I do. If I can somehow use my gifts to help my nephew have a better life, how unbelievably amazing that would be. And if you can help me to do that, you are also unbelievably amazing, and thank you!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help financially, believe me I understand. But please feel free to pass on this campaign, and spread the word. And otherwise if you can just put some healing thoughts out for Liam, I would appreciate it greatly. He can beat this, I see it in him. Thank you for taking the time to watch my campaign. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Seattle’s 2000 ProParks Levy identified 2.5 acres at 2400 S Massachusetts St for development as a neighborhood park.  A park plan was generated in 2004 and an initial budget included grading, infrastructure improvements, lawn, pathways and two parking lots.  The improvements were completed in 2006.  Inspired by the music and legacy of Jimi Hendrix, a community led petition to name the park for this iconic Seattle native was supported by the Seattle City Council and approved by the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department.</p>
<p>Jimi Hendrix Park is located next to the Northwest African American Museum in Seattle’s vibrant Central District, a thriving multi-cultural community rich in heritage.  Friends of Jimi Hendrix Park, a dedicated group of community members and park users, and the Jimi Hendrix Park Foundation, have come together since 2009 to lead a public process that brings to life an open green space that will be welcoming and provides an experience that clearly defines its namesake.</p>
<p>The Friends of Jimi Hendrix Park's mission, is to guide community collaboration, create enthusiasm and lead a fundraising effort to accomplish the goal for completing improvements to the park that are sustainable, original and influenced by the artistry of Jimi Hendrix.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.jimihendrixparkfoundation.org/images/designs/schematic.png"" src="""" style=""width: 321px; height: 523px;""/></p>
<p><strong>Community Involvement</strong></p>
<p>Public brainstorming sessions to solicit community input for park improvements was conducted by consulting landscape architects, Murase Associates. Three conceptual designs emerged incorporating  popular ideas  that when combined with the legacy of rock legend Jimi Hendrix are imaginative, neighborhood friendly and create diverse use.  </p>
<p>The design process funded by the Department of Neighborhoods Large Project Matching Fund produced a preferred plan and design narrative in 2011 that was approved by the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department.  The design is bold, colorful and electrifying as the park’s namesake and transforms an empty grassy space into a multi-use location which includes:  </p>
<p>• Interpretative walkways</p>
<p>• Two rain gardens</p>
<p>• Central shelter and other picnic stations</p>
<p>• Sculptural seating shelters</p>
<p>• Enhanced landscaping</p>
<p>• Sound wave wall tribute</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Following a year-long public design process, the Friends of Jimi Hendrix Park in partnership with the Jimi Hendrix Park Foundation, announced the launch of a capital fund-raising campaign to finance construction of the park that will celebrate the life, music and legend of Seattle’s hometown icon, James Marshall Hendrix.  The non-profit foundation, with the assistance of the Friends of Jimi Hendrix Park, aims to raise $1.5 million in private funding to supplement a $500,000 Seattle Parks and Recreation's Parks &amp; Green Spaces Levy Opportunity Fund<span style=""line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt;"">.</span></p>
<p>Now, we need your help to fund the iconic Sound Wave Wall in Jimi's image. Celebrating sound waves, the Sound Wave Wall is a curved colored steel wall with cut outs of notable figures of Jimi Hendrix performing. As the sun passes over the wall, people can walk past his long shadows.</p>
<p>The height of the wall will vary from 4’to 10’ high, and openings will be sited to allow for great views along the path, which connects Jimi Hendrix Park to Sam Smith Park, our gateway. The wall will be oriented for maximum visibility from the street. In addition to the large cut-outs, there will be perforations in the steel to allow for screened images and patterns to form when looked at from varying distances.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The park is a hub that will strengthen the cultural pulse of the Emerald City as it creates a cohesive link between Sam Smith Park and the I-90 Trail, Colman Playground and the Seattle Children’s PlayGarden. Jimi Hendrix Park will become a community gathering space that reflects a musical theme with elements that present a variety of activities to include, walking, active sports, performance, environmental education and history. The development of the park will have global appeal and most importantly will attract citywide intergenerational use and provide wide interest for neighbors and school groups.</p>
<p>Because we are a volunteer organization, every dollar raised would go to the Park. We deeply appreciate your support.</p>

Now, we need your help to fund the iconic Sound Wave Wall in Jimi's image. Celebrating sound waves, the Sound Wave Wall is a curved colored steel wall with cut outs of notable figures of Jimi Hendrix performing. As the sun passes over the wall, people can walk past his long shadows.
The height of the wall will vary from 4’to 10’ high, and openings will be sited to allow for great views along the path, which connects Jimi Hendrix Park to Sam Smith Park, our gateway. The wall will be oriented for maximum visibility from the street. In addition to the large cut-outs, there will be perforations in the steel to allow for screened images and patterns to form when looked at from varying distances.


The Impact
The park is a hub that will strengthen the cultural pulse of the Emerald City as it creates a cohesive link between Sam Smith Park and the I-90 Trail, Colman Playground and the Seattle Children’s PlayGarden. Jimi Hendrix Park will become a community gathering space that reflects a musical theme with elements that present a variety of activities to include, walking, active sports, performance, environmental education and history. The development of the park will have global appeal and most importantly will attract citywide intergenerational use and provide wide interest for neighbors and school groups.
Because we are a volunteer organization, every dollar raised would go to the Park. We deeply appreciate your support.

</h1> <p>This past July, Read Between the Lynes celebrated our 10th year in business in the small but tight-knit community of Woodstock, IL. After the financial crisis hit bookstores everywhere hard, we're proud to not only still be here, but to be expanding in a larger location in October.</p>

<div>All of which have been a popular part of the storefront for many years. But we remain at our heart a bookstore, and the larger location will allow us to expand our inventory in a number of areas, including:</div>

<p>Read Between the Lynes is committed to a sense of community, and we strive to support other local businesses as much as possible. We source our coffee and ice cream locally, and both the Woodstock souvenirs and your perks are designed by Woodstock residents and their companies. For a number of years we have sold Jaci's Cookies in our store, and we will now be able to offer a storefront to even more local businesses, including farms like Prairie Pure Cheese that do not have regular hours or a central location.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>A Truly Independent Bookstore</h3> <p>We love being a part of the community and giving back to it. Now we're asking for your help in return. Your faithful service and steady support (plus, your smiles!) have kept us open through the hardships of these past 10 years. Walk with us as we move into our next great adventure, and help us anchor the future of Read Between the Lynes as both a sustainable business and a vital heart of Woodstock on our beloved Square.</p>
<p>In order to make that happen, we need your involvement and investment. Although we are doing as much as possible to reduce costs, moving and expanding a bookstore is still expensive.  Will $65,000 cover it? Not even close. Our ultimate goal is to raise $200,000 over the course of 18 months to cover all moving costs, and keeping us from accruing future debt. This Indiegogo campaign will help with our initial costs so we can get our feet under us. The funds will go toward:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>New inventory. We have all our awesome new products scheduled to arrive at the beginning of October.</li>
<li>Buildout. We're not building from scratch, but we still need to do some construction in order to install our bookcases and light fixtures.</li>
<li>Moving and storage of our bookcases. It may only be 87 steps from front door to front door, but our bookcases had to take an extended journey so they could stay safe during the transition time.</li>
<li>New computers and systems. Technology has come a long way in 10 years, and we need to upgrade and add more systems in order to adequately serve our customers.</li>

Thank you so much to all who have donated thus far! We want to give you the chance to be among the VERY FIRST to see our new store!
We will be hosting a sneak peek event the evening of Friday, October 16th for everyone who donates $250 or more to our campaign.
New donors, simply donate $250 or more and you'll be on the list. Already donated at that level? FANTASTIC! We'll be in touch with you with more details. 
Already donated to the campaign in an amount less than $250, but still want to attend the sneak peek? Simply make an additional contribution with the difference to bring your total to $250.
Remember, even if you are unable to donate $250 or more, every contribution is an enormous help and we still want to thank you for it. Any donation amount will grant you early access to our new store on the morning of Saturday, October 17th. 



A New Decade at Read Between the Lynes
 This past July, Read Between the Lynes celebrated our 10th year in business in the small but tight-knit community of Woodstock, IL. After the financial crisis hit bookstores everywhere hard, we're proud to not only still be here, but to be expanding in a larger location in October.
   87 Steps Down the Street

Our new location is a historic storefront that has housed many well-loved local businesses over the years. We're excited to honor that history while adding our own spin on the future. We'll continue to serve:
 Coffee
Ice cream
Candies
Specialty food products 
All of which have been a popular part of the storefront for many years. But we remain at our heart a bookstore, and the larger location will allow us to expand our inventory in a number of areas, including:


A wider selection of books in the Children's and Young Adult sections
Children's products, including puppets and educational toys
Graphic Novels
Puzzles
Stationery and Journals
Local Woodstock souvenirs highlighting the history of being typewriter capital of the world



Keeping it Local

Read Between the Lynes is committed to a sense of community, and we strive to support other local businesses as much as possible. We source our coffee and ice cream locally, and both the Woodstock souvenirs and your perks are designed by Woodstock residents and their companies. For a number of years we have sold Jaci's Cookies in our store, and we will now be able to offer a storefront to even more local businesses, including farms like Prairie Pure Cheese that do not have regular hours or a central location.
    
A Truly Independent Bookstore We love being a part of the community and giving back to it. Now we're asking for your help in return. Your faithful service and steady support (plus, your smiles!) have kept us open through the hardships of these past 10 years. Walk with us as we move into our next great adventure, and help us anchor the future of Read Between the Lynes as both a sustainable business and a vital heart of Woodstock on our beloved Square.
In order to make that happen, we need your involvement and investment. Although we are doing as much as possible to reduce costs, moving and expanding a bookstore is still expensive.  Will $65,000 cover it? Not even close. Our ultimate goal is to raise $200,000 over the course of 18 months to cover all moving costs, and keeping us from accruing future debt. This Indiegogo campaign will help with our initial costs so we can get our feet under us. The funds will go toward:


New inventory. We have all our awesome new products scheduled to arrive at the beginning of October.
Buildout. We're not building from scratch, but we still need to do some construction in order to install our bookcases and light fixtures.
Moving and storage of our bookcases. It may only be 87 steps from front door to front door, but our bookcases had to take an extended journey so they could stay safe during the transition time.
New computers and systems. Technology has come a long way in 10 years, and we need to upgrade and add more systems in order to adequately serve our customers.

    

What You Get You get to know that you have been a part of creating a sustainable future for our store and enabling Read Between the Lynes to be a literary hub in Woodstock for years to come.
But as we mentioned earlier, we love giving back to you. You're not only helping us move to a new location, you're becoming a part of a wider ""Book Movement.""  As a thank you for believing in the value of reading, the importance of exchanging ideas, and the presence of an independent bookstore in Woodstock, we're offering you a number of perks.





Show that you're part of our Book Movement with a mug, tote, or t-shirt.
Enjoy some coffee on us.

Be the movement by hosting a book club.

<p><strong>About me</strong></p>
<p>My name is Matt McNellan. I am a Seattle based graphic designer &amp; illustrator. I have always had a passion for illustration, community, and the natural world. I graduated from Front Range Community College with an AA in Graphic Design in 2017. Ever Since I have been working with clients on creative projects. Presently, I am designing a piece of art that can be used as an operational deck of playing cards in hopes of bringing people together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the project</strong></p>
<p>This project is going to be designed in efforts to help support King County Communities. 10% of the pledged money will be donated to Ballard Food Bank.  This organization helps bring food and hope to people in Seattle, because there can be enough for everyone. The reason that I chose this nonprofit organization is because I believe that supporting local food organizations is one of the solutions that can help us shape a better future. For more information on this nonprofit organization you can follow the link below.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ballardfoodbank.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ballardfoodbank.org </a></p>
<p>I am designing an illustrative piece of art that can be used as an operational deck of playing cards with unique illustrations on each card. I like the idea of creating artwork that can be used for something practical, and helps bring people together. This project falls in line with the many goals I have for the future as a graphic designer &amp; illustrator. I create all of my artwork with passion and purpose in hopes that it inspires others to follow their dreams and come together to help make a better world.</p>
<p>These playing cards have 3 themes</p>
<p>• The 4 Seasons, each season has been matched with a suit in the card deck</p>
<p>• Day / Night which correspond with black or red cards</p>
<p>• The natural world which is represented in the illustrations of Plants &amp; Animals</p>
<p><strong>Reaching the goal</strong></p>
<p>This project has a goal of $1000. This goal is a rough estimate of what it will cost me to produce and distribute these card decks. 10% of all the pledged money with be donated to Ballard Food Bank, a nonprofit organization that helps bring food to people in need. </p>
<p>I have set that goal in hopes of raising funding for this organization and to cover the costs that come with making this project into a reality. There are also plenty of things that won't cost me any money but will require a lot of donated time and high attention to detail. There will be a lot of hours spent on planning and drafting this project, designing the cards and box, as well as doing research about different topics involved. </p>
<p>Here are a few things that I have to consider when taking on a project like this:</p>
<p>• Printing costs </p>
<p>• Shipping costs (I can ship anywhere in the USA)</p>
<p>• Which printing companies are the most eco friendly (what materials they use &amp; practices) </p>
<p>• How long will this project take to complete (putting time into designing, printing, shipping)</p>
<p>• How can this project bring people together and give back to the community</p>
<p>• Can I do this all by myself or will I need help from other people </p>
<p>• What are some of the problems that I might I encounter along the way </p>
<p> If this project exceeds its goal of $1000 then the money will be used to print more copies of the deck and a second version of the deck may be considered for the future.</p>

<div>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>My name is Jenna Moran (author of the Nobilis RPG, the Hitherby Dragons web serial, An Unclean Legacy, Fable of the Swan, the Invasion picture book illustrated by Elizabeth Sherry, and a lot of miscellaneous RPG-type stuff) and I've written a new trilogy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enemies Endure, Book I: Stomping the World Round</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enemies Endure, Book II: The Storm that Saw Itself</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enemies Endure, Book III: Vidar's Boot</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm serializing the completed draft on <a href=""http://books.hitherby.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://books.hitherby.com</a>.</p>
<p>I'm looking to do four more things with this and I need your help with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>obtain professional editing services</li>
<li>fund cover art for the books</li>
<li>cover the site cost and miscellaneous expenses</li>
<li>obtain Tony Damiani's beautiful and thematic website art for <a href=""http://books.hitherby.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://books.hitherby.com</a> for the remainder of the books' run.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll be releasing a print-on-demand version as well, which sponsors at the $15+ level will be able to pick up at cost.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Current Goal! </strong>Covers by award-winning art nouveau artist <a href=""http://www.echo-x.com/%20target="" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Echo Chernik.</a> She's worked on campaigns and promotion for Disney, BBC America, Camel Cigarettes, the Miller Brewing Company, Keystone, the State of Illinois, Sears, and Arlo Guthrie, and more; not to mention contributing to Shadowrun, books for Penguin, Random House, and Llewellyn Worldwide, and creating at least one poster <a href=""http://www.echo-x.com/press/press_CBS_A1.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">alluring enough</a> to tempt even ordinary, God-fearing citizens into the wicked abyss of theft.</p>
<p>More importantly, . . . look. I missed my window to commission covers from Alphonse Mucha. I was born tragically too late. But she's a worthy successor to the art nouveau style; she makes cupcake Cthulhu illustrations on the side . . .</p>
And she's in for the three covers of the Enemies Endure series if <em>you </em>can help us get there!</div>
<div>
<br/> </div>
<div>
<h3>What You're Contributing</h3>
<p>Here's a little more about where the funds are going. The first $8000 has paid for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neall Price, editor for <strong>Nobilis: the Essentials</strong>, has agreed to edit the three novels.</li>
<li>Anthony Damiani, artist, will be providing art for the website serialization over the course of 2012 and 2013.</li>
<li>I'll be covering various miscellaneous expenses (site costs, paypal costs, fulfillment costs for the postcard thing, and indiegogo costs).</li>
<li>Echo Chernik is doing covers for two of these books.</li>
<li>I have a small fund set aside for cover art for the third book.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Funds from $8,000 to $8,800 . . . will go to bulking up my fund for the third cover, site expenses, and unexpected expenses!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What if we land between $8,800 and $9,500? . . . this is where I'll be focused on a little extra polish on the short story collection, the site, little things like that.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What if we land between $9,500 and $10,000? . . . this is where I'll be focused on a nice omnibus edition, a cool artbook with the site art from books.hitherby.com, seeing about planning for covers for the imago.hitherby.com story collections I want to do someday, and the like! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>What if we land between $10,000 and $11,000? . . . eek! That's such a hard place to know what happens! A single unexpected expense in here could change everything! See, around $10,100 I can afford a third Echo Chernik cover if there are no unplanned costs. But will I actually be able to do that? What if the people who got me here actually wanted that extra polish that I mentioned previously? What if there's an extra expense? I don't know what I'm doing! Something! Something that will help you! But I don't know what and so I'm not promising anything in PARTICULAR that I haven't already promised. ^_^</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What about $11,000? . . . bam! A third Echo Chernik cover. Everything is pretty groovy for me at that point. Total success and all is sweet. ^_^</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What if we land between $11,000 and $12,000? . . . three Echo Chernik covers, plus extra stuff.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What about $12,000+? I've completed my goals for the project, put together a few extras, and I can use any dollars after this to pay myself a little! Then a little more for my artists and helpers. Then a bit more for me. And so forth!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
</div>
<p>What <em>you</em> get is an amazing series of books.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Listen. I want to tell a story. Not this story exactly---this is a pretty weird sidetrack to that story---but I want to tell the story that people are good.</p>
<p>I need help to do that. I need . . . well, I need visibility.</p>
<p>Probably writing novels and RPGs isn't the best way to spread this message, but you've got to do what you love, even if it's not a good idea.</p>
<p>So please, whether you can contribute or not, help me get the word out about this project!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>New Reward!</h3>
<p><em>Strange Encounters.</em><br/><br/>I can't write you into the book itself, since it's written and can be a pretty scary place anyway, but your Lethal Magnet Professor certainly <em>can</em> have an interesting or perplexing encounter with an extremely sharp goat, Jane, Martin, or, well, whatever! Perhaps this is a cartoon and caption. Perhaps it is a few paragraphs of story. A bit of slice of life, in short, of your avatar in this world.<br/><br/>If a bunch of these sell, I'll make them a *thing,* with a new one appearing each month, and with the sidebar link going to the latest instead of to a sponsor. If not many sell, maybe I'll just expand your bit of the sponsors page. We'll see!</p>
<p>If you want this reward but don't want to give up an existing perk, just talk to me; our short story purchasers will be able to obtain this at their request, and arranging for a strange encounter with our Dean is on my task list. ^_^</p>
<br/> 
<h3>Stretch Goals!</h3>
<p>Let's get this party started. ^_^</p>
</div>
<div><strong>$3000: Achieved!</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got to $3000! I’ll start planning the print-on-demand release of these books with the intention of making them available at cost to Sponsors ($15+ contributors) and at a reasonable cost to other donors and the general public.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>$3500: Achieved!</strong><br/><p>We got to $3500! I’ll add a small collection of short stories—-existing work, but not previously available from me in an organized, edited ePub form—-to the rewards at the $7+ level. I’ll assemble them, get them edited, get a simple cover for them, and bundle them in. ^_^</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$4000: Achieved!<br/></strong></p>
<p>We got to $4000! I'm adding the electronic version of my novel <em>An Unclean Legacy </em>to the rewards at the $5+ level.</p>
<p>What is <em>An Unclean Legacy?</em></p>
<p>It's a<span> fairy tale about an enchanted princess, a deathless sorcerer, a fallen knight, a man of God, a bad house, a soulless girl, the Devil's child, a madman, a witch, and Santa Claus. It's a story of redemption. </span></p>
<p><span>I hesitated about this because I bet a lot of my contributors have already read <em>An Unclean Legacy. </em>It's been out for a while and it's recently been on sale.</span></p>
<p>But I'm so proud of this book. I have to include this at <em>some</em> stretch goal!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$4500: Achieved!</strong><em><br/></em></p>
<p>We got to $4500! I'm adding the electronic version of my latest novel <em>Fable of the Swan </em>to the rewards at the $9+ level.</p>
<p><em>Fable of the Swan</em> is a young adult fantasy novel with surrealist overtones. I think it's pretty cool but it was written this year so I don't have an objective opinion on it yet. ^_^</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>$5000: Achieved!</strong><br/><p>This is exciting!</p>
<p>So, listen. Listen. Listen. A while back I started on what was going to be my happiest and best project ever, a series of ""Hitherby Dragons"" novels, not related stories like Enemies Endure but the heart of the thing; only the publisher I was working with flaked hard and the artist I was working with flaked hard and suddenly I was sitting there holding one and a half of the favorite books of mine I've ever written and nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>And 'cause I'm pretty easy to throw into despair; and because it's a short novel and not a full novel and so hard to throw into regular publication channels; and because pulling together my current RPG project is the most genuinely incredible amount of work I've ever had to do on anything, I wound up just kind of sitting on this thing.</p>
<p>But you guys have restored my faith.</p>
I love you all, and you have given me some faith here, so I'll tell you what. We hit $5000, so . . .</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm going to release that first short novel, <em>Jack o'Lantern Girl</em>, and introduce people who maybe aren't so much into reading fiction blogs to the story of Hitherby Dragons; and tell those of you who <em>are </em>into reading fiction blogs a lot more about what happened on the firewood world; and move finishing the second book, <em>Firewood Boy</em>, up a lot higher on my priority queue;
<p>And, of course, include <em>Jack o'Lantern Girl </em>in the list of books available at the $5 level plus.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

Hi!
My name is Jenna Moran (author of the Nobilis RPG, the Hitherby Dragons web serial, An Unclean Legacy, Fable of the Swan, the Invasion picture book illustrated by Elizabeth Sherry, and a lot of miscellaneous RPG-type stuff) and I've written a new trilogy:

Enemies Endure, Book I: Stomping the World Round
Enemies Endure, Book II: The Storm that Saw Itself
Enemies Endure, Book III: Vidar's Boot

I'm serializing the completed draft on http://books.hitherby.com.
I'm looking to do four more things with this and I need your help with them:

obtain professional editing services
fund cover art for the books
cover the site cost and miscellaneous expenses
obtain Tony Damiani's beautiful and thematic website art for http://books.hitherby.com for the remainder of the books' run.

I'll be releasing a print-on-demand version as well, which sponsors at the $15+ level will be able to pick up at cost.
 
Current Goal! Covers by award-winning art nouveau artist Echo Chernik. She's worked on campaigns and promotion for Disney, BBC America, Camel Cigarettes, the Miller Brewing Company, Keystone, the State of Illinois, Sears, and Arlo Guthrie, and more; not to mention contributing to Shadowrun, books for Penguin, Random House, and Llewellyn Worldwide, and creating at least one poster alluring enough to tempt even ordinary, God-fearing citizens into the wicked abyss of theft.
More importantly, . . . look. I missed my window to commission covers from Alphonse Mucha. I was born tragically too late. But she's a worthy successor to the art nouveau style; she makes cupcake Cthulhu illustrations on the side . . .
And she's in for the three covers of the Enemies Endure series if you can help us get there!

 

What You're Contributing
Here's a little more about where the funds are going. The first $8000 has paid for this:

Neall Price, editor for Nobilis: the Essentials, has agreed to edit the three novels.
Anthony Damiani, artist, will be providing art for the website serialization over the course of 2012 and 2013.
I'll be covering various miscellaneous expenses (site costs, paypal costs, fulfillment costs for the postcard thing, and indiegogo costs).
Echo Chernik is doing covers for two of these books.
I have a small fund set aside for cover art for the third book.


 
Funds from $8,000 to $8,800 . . . will go to bulking up my fund for the third cover, site expenses, and unexpected expenses!
 
What if we land between $8,800 and $9,500? . . . this is where I'll be focused on a little extra polish on the short story collection, the site, little things like that.
 
What if we land between $9,500 and $10,000? . . . this is where I'll be focused on a nice omnibus edition, a cool artbook with the site art from books.hitherby.com, seeing about planning for covers for the imago.hitherby.com story collections I want to do someday, and the like! 
 
What if we land between $10,000 and $11,000? . . . eek! That's such a hard place to know what happens! A single unexpected expense in here could change everything! See, around $10,100 I can afford a third Echo Chernik cover if there are no unplanned costs. But will I actually be able to do that? What if the people who got me here actually wanted that extra polish that I mentioned previously? What if there's an extra expense? I don't know what I'm doing! Something! Something that will help you! But I don't know what and so I'm not promising anything in PARTICULAR that I haven't already promised. ^_^
 
What about $11,000? . . . bam! A third Echo Chernik cover. Everything is pretty groovy for me at that point. Total success and all is sweet. ^_^
 
What if we land between $11,000 and $12,000? . . . three Echo Chernik covers, plus extra stuff.
 
What about $12,000+? I've completed my goals for the project, put together a few extras, and I can use any dollars after this to pay myself a little! Then a little more for my artists and helpers. Then a bit more for me. And so forth!

What you get is an amazing series of books.

The Impact
Listen. I want to tell a story. Not this story exactly---this is a pretty weird sidetrack to that story---but I want to tell the story that people are good.
I need help to do that. I need . . . well, I need visibility.
Probably writing novels and RPGs isn't the best way to spread this message, but you've got to do what you love, even if it's not a good idea.
So please, whether you can contribute or not, help me get the word out about this project!
 
New Reward!
Strange Encounters.I can't write you into the book itself, since it's written and can be a pretty scary place anyway, but your Lethal Magnet Professor certainly can have an interesting or perplexing encounter with an extremely sharp goat, Jane, Martin, or, well, whatever! Perhaps this is a cartoon and caption. Perhaps it is a few paragraphs of story. A bit of slice of life, in short, of your avatar in this world.If a bunch of these sell, I'll make them a *thing,* with a new one appearing each month, and with the sidebar link going to the latest instead of to a sponsor. If not many sell, maybe I'll just expand your bit of the sponsors page. We'll see!
If you want this reward but don't want to give up an existing perk, just talk to me; our short story purchasers will be able to obtain this at their request, and arranging for a strange encounter with our Dean is on my task list. ^_^

<p><b>How do I pay my shipping costs?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>When you have selected a perk, please manually increase the amount according to the shipping costs for your country:<br/></p>
<p><b>1. Shipping &amp; handling within Germany, please add: 7 Euro <br/></b></p>
<p><b>2. Shipping &amp; handling within the EU, please add: </b><span style=""""><b>10</b></span><b> Euro<br/></b></p>
<p><b>3. Shipping &amp; handling  world wide, please add: 17 Euro</b><br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>If you raise more than you need, what will you do with the money?</b></p>
<p>As you may have noticed, the amount of money is calculated quite optimistic for the scope we plan to present. For now, we have only calculated a base plan of activities to make things happen. Simply put: More money means more projects and an even greater festival. We would for example invest any additional budget into a color print of the catalogue or paint more murals. The motto thus is: The more you give us, the more we can make happen!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I pick more than one perk?</b></p>
<p>Yes, of course! But you must pay for them separately so that we can keep track of what you chose.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I contribute more money when I select a particular package?</b></p>
<p>Yes, if you chose a perk that is €100 and you want to donate €150, just enter the number manually upon checkout. A virtual high five from our side will be your guaranteed reward!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>If I don't want a perk, can I still contribute?</b></p>
<p>Sure, just click on the ""contribute"" button, enter the sum you want to donate and choose ""No perk, I just want to donate"". Two virtual high fives (left and right!) and our eternal gratitude will be your reward!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I help without donating?</b></p>
<p>If you can not or do not want to give us money, there are still ways to support us. Spread the word, share the video and the link to the crowdfunding campaign with your friends. Via Facebook, Twitter, Email and a phone call to your grandma. Let as many people as possible know about the project and help us organize a great festival. Thank you in advance!</p>

</div></div>","20 years of Backjumps  -Festival of urban communication in Berlin!Backjumps, the platform for urban communication and aesthetics, turns 20 this year. We want to celebrate this awesome anniversary with you by throwing an truly unique festival in Berlin and for Berlin! Our plan: We want to invite as many artists from all over the world to Berlin, create a great variety of workshops, tours and art exhibitions - and thus present a unique mix and showing which is free and accessible to anyone. We need your support to organize 20 years of Backjumps - Festival of urban communication in Berlin!What is Backjumps?""What started out as a fanzine covering the aerosol painting scene went on to become - through ""The Live Issue"" - the reference point for group exhibitions, covering the art that we see all around our cities.Adrian Nabi has been at the genesis of this project. He is more than just a street art trendsetter: by bringing influential artists like Banksy, Os Gemeos or Shepard Fairey to Berlin, his shows and exhibitions became milestones in the ever-evolving urban communications scene.



Backjumps is an indoor, outdoor and interactive event, spanning the connections between visual art, digital and interactive installations, as well as performance art in the form of dance for example. Artwork has been produced within gallery walls as well as chosen sites in the surrounding neighborhood of Kreuzberg.
Though he may have been shunned and overlooked by the players who jumped on the bandwagon, you can ask anybody in the who's who of the scene and they will confirm the importance and relevance that Backjumps has had. The Kunstraum Kreuzberg, in the heart of Berlin, has been the venue for all of the six Live Issue events from 2003 until 2012 as well as a special Tokyo installment in 2005, which Adrian curated in celebration of the year of German culture.
Here are just some of the prominent names which have been part of either the magazine, subsequent fanzine or of the group shows:
Banksy, Blu, Brad Downey, Delta, Futura, Jay One, JR, Henry Chalfant, Martha Cooper, NUG & Pike, Os Gemeos, Rammellzee, Shepard Fairey, Skki, Swoon, Zevs
These are just some of the more well known names, though there are obviously many more from Berlin, Europe, and the rest of the world.""

<p>Over the past year my team and I have been looking to do a project in Australia. I am excited to announce that we have touched base with local artists in
Sydney who are thrilled to work with us. However, as with
any event in another country, there are costs involved. I need your help getting there in order to fulfill this project and to help provide spaces for young artists to do the same!</p>

This will be the fourth overseas art project and
film the Antagonists have created in the last 8 years. From New York, Germany, Portugal,
and Ecuador continue to work with and develop the artists we encountered on past projects. We couldn’t have made those trips possible without the help from our
supporters via Kickstarter campaigns .
Each project resulted in a feature documentary film that continues to
help the artists involved. We try to provide venues for artists, mentoring, job
placement, and exposure, and we hope—with your help—we can do it again. We
have everything ready for this event, but we need your help in covering
travel, accommodations, and final production costs to build the
exhibition and workshops. With your support, we will expand our reach
and discover new art and artists. <p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p><b>What are we planning?</b></p>
<p>· 
An art project titled “Dwelling.” In short, the project analyzes the feeling of safety in our homes, a safety that can
be lost at a moments notice. International and local artists will  interpret this broad concept and express
it through a variety of mediums including print, film making, and video mapping, to name a few.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A film
screening of our past projects. <i>This Is
Berlin Not New York</i>, <i>The Dolls Of
Lisbon</i> and <i>Self Medicated: A film
about Art</i>. These three project comprise a series of films about traveling artists
and art projects. We hope Sydney can be the center of the next chapter.</p><p><b><span style=""font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Trailers of our past films and projects: </span><br/><i></i></b></p><p><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F104053581&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F104053581&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F486479281_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F22367952&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F22367952&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F212514732_640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F15126896&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F15126896&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F90573440_640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

<p>After practicing law for
a number of years in Washington, D.C., and then in Florida, Ms. McCaffrey
permanently settled in New York City in 2004.  The focus of her practice is bank
regulatory law, financial transactions, and corporate law. Before establishing
her own firm in 1992, Ms. McCaffrey was a partner in a major law firm in
Washington, D.C.  For eight years, she served as General Counsel of a $7.5
billion regional financial institution headquartered in Virginia.  Earlier in
her career, Ms. McCaffrey was a Senior Counsel with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. Ms. McCaffrey received her B.A. from Tufts University in
1966 and her law degree from Boston University in 1970.  Ms. McCaffrey is a
member of the New York, Florida, D.C., and Massachusetts bar associations. She
was president of the Washington D.C. Bar Association for Women.  If it’s not
already clear, I am very proud of her. </p>

<b><br/></b><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b><br/></p>
<p>It's awkward asking for
help but it's essential to make this project happen. For your donation, you not
only receive our sincerest gratitude, but you are also able to choose a reward,
listed on the right side of this page. We have no problem taking donations
without rewards but we have a host of special ones for this
project. Books, films, shirts, original art, credit as a supporter in the
next film, and more. We can't wait to send you some original artwork made
by us for this project! Even more importantly, you'll help us build a
new network of artists. I invite you to become a part of this exciting
time for us. No donation amount is too little or too great. Please take a look
at our IndieGoGo page for the list of donation options and reward choices.</p>
<p><b>How your donation
will be used</b></p>
<p>1. Travel: We are hoping
to offset travel costs. This is the
biggest expense, about $2,500 for each of us, for a total of $10,000</p>
<p>2. Accommodations:
$3,000 for 3 weeks.</p>
<p>3. Show production: $2,000
for the art show, $1,000 for workshops, screenings and everything else.</p>
<p>Anything beyond that the
overflow will help offset the cost and burdens of our other invited artists. It
would be fantastic to help bring artists from Europe.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Taking 3 weeks off from
work, adding the high cost of travel and renting a place for 3 weeks, food and
extras, this project will leave us financially drained even if we do reach
our goal. Based on our past excursions however, I know it’s worth it. The
relationships and experiences change my perceptions of not just the
world at large, but the limits of what I can do as an artist. The films have allowed
me to share this with a larger audience. Your donation, your investment,
and your trust is a vote of confidence that helps me succeed and lets me have
an impact on others.</p>
<p>There is no way I, or
the Antagonists, would be here today without the love and support of all of you
and I want to thank you again from the bottom of my heart— you are making this
possible for us and for that I am truly grateful.</p>
<p><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risks &amp;
Challenges</span><br/></b></p>
<p>Traveling with artists
to the other side of the world is never easy. We have found that you have to be
flexible with local representatives. Things always change once you are on
the ground. Weather, resources, and people can quickly dry up. Dealing with our
own artists is like being a babysitter on steroids. Making a film about these
projects is mentally and physically exhausting. While everyone else is
having a good time, I am looking through the lens, trying to capture the
moment.</p>
<p>However, we have now done
this thrice before and are pros at dealing with unexpected changes—either way, the
hardships makes for a fun film. The best results I find are when you are
willing to work just a little bit harder to make your vision a
reality. We’ve already pulled together the majority of the locations we
need and found amazing people who have been willing to help us out with their
time and their talents. Because we have built and opened exhibitions before, we
are confident in our abilities to carry this project through to the end.</p>
<p><b>Not able to donate?
You can still help!</b></p>
<p>We can't get around this
fact: cash is what we need to make this happen. However, if you're not able to
support the project financially, we hope that you'll share it with others and
spread the word. Please share it if you donate, too. Please pass this on. Post
it on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media. Make some noise! And
of course, we hope that if you’re in Sydney, Australia during the show,
you’ll come see the exhibit, films, and join the workshops!</p>

<p><b>Testimonials</b></p>
<p>“I worked with Ethan and
the Antagonist Movement on two projects:</p>
<p><i>This is Berlin, Not New York</i> (2008) in Berlin, Germany, and <i>The Dolls of Lisbon</i> (2011) in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
<p>A vivid exchange on
ideas and techniques, creating new contacts in cities around the world, and
experiencing amazing art made those two projects into a huge success.</p>
<p>Ethan and his crew are
very organized and enthusiastic about their projects.</p>
<p>I can highly recommend
it to be part of the Antagonist Movement and I am really excited about the new
“Dwelling” project in Australia.”</p>

<p></p>
<p>""Hosting
and working with the Antagonists was a very enriching experience. We learned a
lot. We grew a lot. And we became part of a family. Might seem exaggerated but,
in 2010, Lisbon was struggling with the beginning of a very severe economic
crisis. The energy and actions provided by them [the Antagonists] provided us
with a little more strength to keep up. Art is more than just concepts and
objects, art is a full life experience."" <br/></p>

<p>""I have worked with the
Antagonists since 2009, from the time we had music and art shows in the back of
a grungy bar. While our locations, artists, and shows have changed, the basic
structure of the Antagonists will always remain—it is the glue—art for art’s
sake. While we often create art for other sakes as well (community, enrichment,
communication), that one crucial tenet is never forgotten, and it reminds us
all that, first and foremost, art should be a love and a passion. The
Antagonists take this love, and spread it throughout every community we visit,
and in doing so, leave small breadcrumbs of ourselves sprinkled across the
planet."" </p>

<p>Psycho Moto Zine was a periodical
published from the late 1980s to early 2000s, consisting mostly of short
stories, reviews and artwork. This fanzine would later birth
the Antagonist Art Movement, a consortium of like-minded artists, writers,
filmmakers, etc.</p>
<p>The magazine was originally published in 1989 under
the name East Coast Exchange by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Minsker"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Ethan H. Minsker</span></a>. Copies were produced illicitly by friends who worked
in copy shops during Minsker’s college years at School of Visual Arts in
New York City and in Washington D.C. during Minsker’s summer breaks.</p>
<p>By 1994 Psycho Moto Zine (PMZ) had transformed into an arts and literary
fanzine with reviews that covered underground art, fanzines, films and
music. This connection between different creative elements was the inspiration
for what would later become the Antagonist Art Movement.</p>

Short Summary
 
Over the past year my team and I have been looking to do a project in Australia. I am excited to announce that we have touched base with local artists in
Sydney who are thrilled to work with us. However, as with
any event in another country, there are costs involved. I need your help getting there in order to fulfill this project and to help provide spaces for young artists to do the same!

This will be the fourth overseas art project and
film the Antagonists have created in the last 8 years. From New York, Germany, Portugal,
and Ecuador continue to work with and develop the artists we encountered on past projects. We couldn’t have made those trips possible without the help from our
supporters via Kickstarter campaigns .
Each project resulted in a feature documentary film that continues to
help the artists involved. We try to provide venues for artists, mentoring, job
placement, and exposure, and we hope—with your help—we can do it again. We
have everything ready for this event, but we need your help in covering
travel, accommodations, and final production costs to build the
exhibition and workshops. With your support, we will expand our reach
and discover new art and artists.    

What are we planning?
· 
An art project titled “Dwelling.” In short, the project analyzes the feeling of safety in our homes, a safety that can
be lost at a moments notice. International and local artists will  interpret this broad concept and express
it through a variety of mediums including print, film making, and video mapping, to name a few.
· 
A film
screening of our past projects. This Is
Berlin Not New York, The Dolls Of
Lisbon and Self Medicated: A film
about Art. These three project comprise a series of films about traveling artists
and art projects. We hope Sydney can be the center of the next chapter.Trailers of our past films and projects: 
For each of the
following events we hope to collaborate with local artists.
· 
Workshops:
How to make a fanzine, working with textile design and various other themes. These
will focus working with at-risk youth.
· 
Writer’s
night: 5 minutes to tell your best story. Introduction of local artists to
global artists.
· 
Portfolio
review: We run our portfolio reviews a little differently.
We aren't so much interested in giving critical feedback as we
are in connecting artists with individuals and resources related
to their work. If nothing else, we try to point them in a direction they hadn't
thought about. 
We anticipate this project
to take three weeks.

Who are we?
We travel and work on
these projects as a family, which includes me, my wife Un Lee, my mother Judith
E. McCaffrey, and Blu L. Minsker, my daughter. 
For this project I will
be acting as head curator, filming the events, running the fanzine workshop,
and hosting the screenings. Here is a little bio about me. Photo of Ethan by Simon Harsent.
Ethan H. Minsker is a
writer, artist, and independent filmmaker. Minsker has written screenplays and
produced and directed eight independent films. He is the founder of the
Antagonist Movement, Inc., a consortium of artists, writers, and musicians
based in New York's East Village. Minsker is also the creator and
editor-in-chief of Psycho Moto Zine, in publication from 1988-present. He received
his B.F.A. in Film with honors from the School of Visual Arts and his M.A. in
Media from the New School. He resides in New York City.
Un Lee will be running
the textile workshop and assisting the fanzine workshop. She will
also be the assistant curator for the “Dwelling” show. 



Un Lee is a NY artist who draws, paints, illustrates, animates but mostly designs textiles.  She formed her textile/surface design company MADE BY UN in 2012 with clients ranging from Barnes and Noble to Walmart.  Un Lee graduated with a B.F.A. in Animation at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, then moved to Los Angeles and worked in many animated television series including Family Guy. 

For this project, Judith
E. McCaffrey will be giving legal advice, coordinating  travel and lodging logistics, and assisting with
planning, promoting, and organizing the events. Over the
years she has been an active legal advisor and advocate for members of the group. She has done extensive public relations and guided us
in setting up our not-for-profit. 



After practicing law for
a number of years in Washington, D.C., and then in Florida, Ms. McCaffrey
permanently settled in New York City in 2004.  The focus of her practice is bank
regulatory law, financial transactions, and corporate law. Before establishing
her own firm in 1992, Ms. McCaffrey was a partner in a major law firm in
Washington, D.C.  For eight years, she served as General Counsel of a $7.5
billion regional financial institution headquartered in Virginia.  Earlier in
her career, Ms. McCaffrey was a Senior Counsel with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. Ms. McCaffrey received her B.A. from Tufts University in
1966 and her law degree from Boston University in 1970.  Ms. McCaffrey is a
member of the New York, Florida, D.C., and Massachusetts bar associations. She
was president of the Washington D.C. Bar Association for Women.  If it’s not
already clear, I am very proud of her. 


What We Need &
What You Get
It's awkward asking for
help but it's essential to make this project happen. For your donation, you not
only receive our sincerest gratitude, but you are also able to choose a reward,
listed on the right side of this page. We have no problem taking donations
without rewards but we have a host of special ones for this
project. Books, films, shirts, original art, credit as a supporter in the
next film, and more. We can't wait to send you some original artwork made
by us for this project! Even more importantly, you'll help us build a
new network of artists. I invite you to become a part of this exciting
time for us. No donation amount is too little or too great. Please take a look
at our IndieGoGo page for the list of donation options and reward choices.
How your donation
will be used
1. Travel: We are hoping
to offset travel costs. This is the
biggest expense, about $2,500 for each of us, for a total of $10,000
2. Accommodations:
$3,000 for 3 weeks.
3. Show production: $2,000
for the art show, $1,000 for workshops, screenings and everything else.
Anything beyond that the
overflow will help offset the cost and burdens of our other invited artists. It
would be fantastic to help bring artists from Europe.
The Impact
Taking 3 weeks off from
work, adding the high cost of travel and renting a place for 3 weeks, food and
extras, this project will leave us financially drained even if we do reach
our goal. Based on our past excursions however, I know it’s worth it. The
relationships and experiences change my perceptions of not just the
world at large, but the limits of what I can do as an artist. The films have allowed
me to share this with a larger audience. Your donation, your investment,
and your trust is a vote of confidence that helps me succeed and lets me have
an impact on others.
There is no way I, or
the Antagonists, would be here today without the love and support of all of you
and I want to thank you again from the bottom of my heart— you are making this
possible for us and for that I am truly grateful.
Risks &
Challenges
Traveling with artists
to the other side of the world is never easy. We have found that you have to be
flexible with local representatives. Things always change once you are on
the ground. Weather, resources, and people can quickly dry up. Dealing with our
own artists is like being a babysitter on steroids. Making a film about these
projects is mentally and physically exhausting. While everyone else is
having a good time, I am looking through the lens, trying to capture the
moment.
However, we have now done
this thrice before and are pros at dealing with unexpected changes—either way, the
hardships makes for a fun film. The best results I find are when you are
willing to work just a little bit harder to make your vision a
reality. We’ve already pulled together the majority of the locations we
need and found amazing people who have been willing to help us out with their
time and their talents. Because we have built and opened exhibitions before, we
are confident in our abilities to carry this project through to the end.
Not able to donate?
You can still help!
We can't get around this
fact: cash is what we need to make this happen. However, if you're not able to
support the project financially, we hope that you'll share it with others and
spread the word. Please share it if you donate, too. Please pass this on. Post
it on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media. Make some noise! And
of course, we hope that if you’re in Sydney, Australia during the show,
you’ll come see the exhibit, films, and join the workshops!

Testimonials
“I worked with Ethan and
the Antagonist Movement on two projects:
This is Berlin, Not New York (2008) in Berlin, Germany, and The Dolls of Lisbon (2011) in Lisbon, Portugal.
A vivid exchange on
ideas and techniques, creating new contacts in cities around the world, and
experiencing amazing art made those two projects into a huge success.
Ethan and his crew are
very organized and enthusiastic about their projects.
I can highly recommend
it to be part of the Antagonist Movement and I am really excited about the new
“Dwelling” project in Australia.”
Jakob Theileis
artist
Berlin, Germany


""Hosting
and working with the Antagonists was a very enriching experience. We learned a
lot. We grew a lot. And we became part of a family. Might seem exaggerated but,
in 2010, Lisbon was struggling with the beginning of a very severe economic
crisis. The energy and actions provided by them [the Antagonists] provided us
with a little more strength to keep up. Art is more than just concepts and
objects, art is a full life experience."" 
Carlos Alcobia
Curator
Lisbon,
Portugal



""I have worked with the
Antagonists since 2009, from the time we had music and art shows in the back of
a grungy bar. While our locations, artists, and shows have changed, the basic
structure of the Antagonists will always remain—it is the glue—art for art’s
sake. While we often create art for other sakes as well (community, enrichment,
communication), that one crucial tenet is never forgotten, and it reminds us
all that, first and foremost, art should be a love and a passion. The
Antagonists take this love, and spread it throughout every community we visit,
and in doing so, leave small breadcrumbs of ourselves sprinkled across the
planet.""

Psycho Moto Zine was a periodical
published from the late 1980s to early 2000s, consisting mostly of short
stories, reviews and artwork. This fanzine would later birth
the Antagonist Art Movement, a consortium of like-minded artists, writers,
filmmakers, etc.
The magazine was originally published in 1989 under
the name East Coast Exchange by Ethan H. Minsker. Copies were produced illicitly by friends who worked
in copy shops during Minsker’s college years at School of Visual Arts in
New York City and in Washington D.C. during Minsker’s summer breaks.
By 1994 Psycho Moto Zine (PMZ) had transformed into an arts and literary
fanzine with reviews that covered underground art, fanzines, films and
music. This connection between different creative elements was the inspiration
for what would later become the Antagonist Art Movement.

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">With your help the action begins now, and we can open the preview museum in 2014. By reaching our fundraising goal, we can start to build exhibits, secure real estate, renovate a facility, transport artifacts, and build display fixtures.</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<ul><li>Building, Transporting, and Setting Up Exhibits: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Although we've got several key artifacts already lined up, we still have to build the <i>Doctor Who</i> <i>TARDIS</i>, along with support structures for the 11-foot <i>Enterprise-E</i> filming prop. We're constructing exhibit structures for the remaining pledged artifacts named above, including display fixtures for the Frank Art Collection. We're also building interactive kiosks throughout the space to enhance the level of visitor experience. <span><br/></span></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span><br/></span>Unique museum objects call for special transportation and care. Almost half the money we hope to raise will fund the safe delivery to and careful installation of artifacts, art, and other display objects. We will work with only the best partner companies to complete these particular tasks, and we are lining up special agreements needed to do so. In the preview facility, these objects will be installed for maximum visual impact, whether in display cases or mounted on the ceiling or walls.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Selecting the Space: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">With the help of local firms and volunteers, we’ve already begun the site selection process, project planning, and architectural design work. Now is the time to integrate these efforts and take the next steps by picking a space in downtown Washington, DC. With your help, we'll be able to make firm commitments and start building the preview museum.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Renovating the Space: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">While we hope to find a space that meets as many of our requirements as possible, chances are we’ll need to renovate a bit: knock out walls; install proper lighting; and widen doorways so we can easily move big objects in and out of the space. These are some of the basic and essential renovations we expect to make.</span>

The preview museum will become a center for science fiction fans and enthusiasts, in the heart of one of the world's greatest cities. In the space, we will hold our first public lectures, education programs, film screenings, book signings, and special events. And you're invited to join our project.The preview location will also house the museum's first collection of artifacts from film, television, literature, and art, along with prototypes from the museum's model shop.  




Preview museum architectural rendering by Imarchination.
It's here that we'll test new concepts, create exhibits, and experiment with technologies like augmented reality to give you the ultimate future-oriented visitor experience. We want this museum to be at the leading edge of imagination and technology. Already, a number of artifacts have been pledged for loan to the preview museum by renowned science fiction artifact collector Adam Schneider and the eminent art collectors Howard and Jane Frank. These artifacts will fill the preview space along with the elements shown in the layout concepts below.




Note: We are a certified non-profit organization incorporated in the District of Columbia.  We will be transmitting information to all of our donors on tax deductibility for their charitable contributions according to IRS guidelines.



The preview museum will have a 3,000 square-foot open floor plan with two major exhibit pieces made exclusively for the museum by Color-Ad, a premier museum design and construction firm. When you enter the space, an 11-foot starship Enterprise-E filming prop will be the first artifact you see next to an iconic Doctor Who TARDIS police box.











Opposite the art exhibit space, gaze upon incredible panoramic vistas of far away worlds that we'll create with a huge floor-to-ceiling LED screen. We want you to feel immersed in the visions of science fiction, so we're installing a high-resolution media system by Traxon Techologies that features unprecedented clarity.For example, imagine watching this panorama of Los Angeles inspired by Blade Runner on the preview location’s wall-size LED!  Made exclusively by David Glicksman of Applied Esoterics in Los Angeles for use in the Museum of Science Fiction preview location, this panorama gives you an exciting idea of the landscapes that could be brought to life if we reach our goal.  


The open floor plan also will also include a coffee and espresso bar, so you can sip a favorite drink while looking upon the captivating views of Cloud City, Pandora, Jurassic Park, and other well-known science fiction vistas. This could become you're favorite meeting place, or just a spot for a weekday inspiration break. 
By evening, the preview museum will convert to a venue. We will be able to host all manner of events. You can join us for a film, a lecture, or an award ceremony.
The architectural firm Imarchination has been helping us design a space that is both innovative and multipurpose. The firm is leading the design of the preview museum and they are full of exciting ideas. Here's a look at their notional plans:







Commercial real estate advisory firm Newmark Grubb Knight Frank is working with us to find the ideal site for the preview museum, with a focus on securing a highly visible location accessible to the 50,000 visitors who come to Washington, DC each day.

 




With your help the action begins now, and we can open the preview museum in 2014. By reaching our fundraising goal, we can start to build exhibits, secure real estate, renovate a facility, transport artifacts, and build display fixtures.



Building, Transporting, and Setting Up Exhibits: Although we've got several key artifacts already lined up, we still have to build the Doctor Who TARDIS, along with support structures for the 11-foot Enterprise-E filming prop. We're constructing exhibit structures for the remaining pledged artifacts named above, including display fixtures for the Frank Art Collection. We're also building interactive kiosks throughout the space to enhance the level of visitor experience. Unique museum objects call for special transportation and care. Almost half the money we hope to raise will fund the safe delivery to and careful installation of artifacts, art, and other display objects. We will work with only the best partner companies to complete these particular tasks, and we are lining up special agreements needed to do so. In the preview facility, these objects will be installed for maximum visual impact, whether in display cases or mounted on the ceiling or walls.

Selecting the Space: With the help of local firms and volunteers, we’ve already begun the site selection process, project planning, and architectural design work. Now is the time to integrate these efforts and take the next steps by picking a space in downtown Washington, DC. With your help, we'll be able to make firm commitments and start building the preview museum.

Renovating the Space: While we hope to find a space that meets as many of our requirements as possible, chances are we’ll need to renovate a bit: knock out walls; install proper lighting; and widen doorways so we can easily move big objects in and out of the space. These are some of the basic and essential renovations we expect to make.













This museum is beginning with a strong grassroots commitment by a group of science fiction fans. That's why a lot of our perks give you exclusive access and input to the decision making behind the museum.

The Museum of Science Fiction will be the world’s first comprehensive science fiction museum, covering the history of the genre across the arts and providing a narrative on its relationship to the real world. Our mission is to be a center of gravity where art and science are powered by imagination.







ART: MSF will be a repository of science fiction art throughout the ages, covering centuries of literature, paintings, sculpture, scale models, film, and music. Art is what we create for aesthetic and contemplative consideration. 

SCIENCE: MSF will show the connections between science fiction and science fact, demonstrating how art can play a role in inspiring scientific investigations and how scientific discovery can inspire art. Science is the systematic and organized body of knowledge shared across cultures and time in a manner that can be tested and verified. 

IMAGINATION: MSF will be a cathedral of imagination, a place to celebrate the unique human characteristic of conceiving new solutions to problems, new stories, and new ideas. This is the aspect of expanding beyond all that we know. 


We are taking an incremental approach to building the Museum of Science Fiction by starting with a preview location. This proven approach  has worked well for many other successful museums. The preview location is step one in our comprehensive and measured plan to make the full-scale museum a reality.  










First, science fiction needs a permanent home. The museum will fill a need to house historically important artifacts that is currently unmet by existing institutions. The museum will also provide a permanent center for the science fiction community and culture.
Second, science fiction motivates learning. At the museum, we will engage children and young adults with a variety of exhibits and programs designed to interest them in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Our education staff will collaborate with
educators and school boards early in the planning phase of programs to make sure our programming supports their plans.




Third, science fiction inspires imagination. STEM skills are important, but they are just part of what's needed to drive innovation. The Museum of Science Fiction has the potential to motivate students to pursue not only STEM fields, but also the arts, and develop the curiosity and imagination needed for innovative thinking and creative problem solving.




The Museum of Science Fiction will feature artifacts covering a wide range of subjects, arrayed in an immersive manner so that visitors are absorbed by the wonder of human imagination. 

We will draw artifacts from art (literature, fine art, illustration, industrial design, film, television, music, and dance), science, and engineering disciplines. At the museum, you will learn how art has inspired and informed science and engineering, as well as how science and engineering have informed art.
We are designing a walk path and features for each gallery that will encourage curiosity and learning. Our permanent collection will include galleries, divided into exhibits, and arranged according to seven themes, presented below. 





Upon entering the museum, the visitor will learn about the definition of science fiction. It will become immediately apparent that there are many definitions, even among science fiction authors, literary experts, and filmmakers; however, the common thread is exploring of the impact of science and technology on society through fictional stories. +MORE

This gallery will capture the settings of science fiction stories. Naturally, the settings vary greatly, but often include alien planets, alternate versions of Earth, or Earth itself in the past, present, or future. Sometimes the setting is galactic or extragalactic, but it may also be limited to a city—or even be microscopic in scale. +MORE

More often than not, science fiction stories depend on some sort of transportation, whereby characters move between locations in a story. These vehicles sometimes become characters in themselves, not unlike how a seagoing vessel is conceived as a contributing personality by members of the crew. +MORE

Most people conceive of time as a linear construct. In reality, it is an integral part of the universe, a fourth dimension along with the three spatial dimensions. Some cultures perceive time as circular, so that it does not have a beginning or an end. This gallery will explore how time is manipulated as part of the story, beginning with a display that describes what time is, special relativity, and other considerations. +MORE


There's more to life in science fiction than aliens — although this gallery will cover alien life in detail. Science fiction also explores genetic engineering, body modification, diseases, and — in an obvious merging with Computers & Robots — biomechanical organisms. In some instances, science fiction dealing with human modification results in a sub-genre called ""body horror."" +MORE


By the 20th century, and especially following the invention of the computer during World War II, the idea of smart computers and sophisticated human-like robots emerged. Typically, science fiction stories that include these artificial organisms explore themes relating to technologies run amok, the ethics of creating an artificial intelligence, robotic warriors, computers that interpret commands in unpredictable ways (with negative consequences for humans), and robots or androids as everyday companions. +MORE


This gallery will be home to all the tools conceived as supporting elements in science fiction stories that are not represented in the other galleries. These exhibits will feature speculative technologies that deserve recognition in part because they influence today’s technology or may influence technological development in the future. +MORE

world of our newest Art Project!  Every year, we sit there and watch the
 big kids ride out of camp to deep Playa on their art cars, while we 
have sat around in camp since we lost the flying saucer.  This year, 
with the help of many people in Denver, some virgins with some very good
 skill sets, and the determination by a couple of our old crusty 
veterans, we will be presenting to you our solution to this problem.  
For those of you who have been following the story so far, we have 
prepared a workspace and purchased a platform.  This project will take 
contributions from our WHOLE BPY FAMILY.  After many years of doing 
this, we know that projects like this cannot be finished without 
everyone's contribution.  <i>""It ain't gonna Puff itself!!!""</i> .  For 
the long and short of it, the Denver crew is going to build this and we 
need the international family to fund it.  This takes a massive amount 
of time and energy to create this kind of an art project.  </p><p>This
 plan involves several stages of construction.  We have finished the 
initial deconstruction, and are preparing to build the main steel 
structure.  Along with this build and this phase of production, we will

world of our newest Art Project!  Every year, we sit there and watch the
 big kids ride out of camp to deep Playa on their art cars, while we 
have sat around in camp since we lost the flying saucer.  This year, 
with the help of many people in Denver, some virgins with some very good
 skill sets, and the determination by a couple of our old crusty 
veterans, we will be presenting to you our solution to this problem.  
For those of you who have been following the story so far, we have 
prepared a workspace and purchased a platform.  This project will take 
contributions from our WHOLE BPY FAMILY.  After many years of doing 
this, we know that projects like this cannot be finished without 
everyone's contribution.  ""It ain't gonna Puff itself!!!"" .  For 
the long and short of it, the Denver crew is going to build this and we 
need the international family to fund it.  This takes a massive amount 
of time and energy to create this kind of an art project.  This
 plan involves several stages of construction.  We have finished the 
initial deconstruction, and are preparing to build the main steel 
structure.  Along with this build and this phase of production, we will 
be rebuilding the engine and replacing all six tires to develop a car 
that is Playa-ready.  Second stage will involve decoration, audio and 
sound installation, along with lighting.  Third stage will be finishing 
touches, deconstruction and packing for transport, and delivery to the

<h3>Give me a dollar!</h3>
So the basic idea here is you hopefully have many dollars, through this site you please give me one of them (or more if you'd like) and then I will use that dollar to help fund my passion, stand-up comedy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Making a living as a local, unknown stand up comic is hard due to low pay scales and other local, unknown stand up comics willing to work for less.  While pursuing my dream, I forgot to have a back up plan as far as an other career or an education to fall back on, so I developed a plan where I start this page and you help me pay off debt and pay utilities (not just spend it on booze) by giving me a dollar.  Hopefully this adds up to many dollars, yet still costs you only one.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You may think, what I great idea, I would love to contribute more than one dollar!  Feel free!  I have put together a few silly, small ""perks"" and the person who contributes the highest donation will be mentioned by name on stage at my monthly show at the Comedy Studio on November 25th, when I talk about the results of this campaign. </div>

<h3>A design collective for Beirut</h3>
<p>The blast that rocked Beirut on August 4 resulted in more than 177 fatalities, 6000 injuries, with an estimated 300,000 people left homeless. The scale of the blast is unlike anything Beirut had seen in its turbulent history and Lebanon is already suffering from near economic collapse, a banking and currency crisis, and the pandemic. To show support and solidarity for the people of Beirut, the international type design community has come together to create a typeface that would raise funds to support the victims of the blast and the reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The heart of this campaign</h3>
<p>Curated by Lebanese designer Dr. Nadine Chahine, the typeface Li Beirut has more than 300 glyphs drawn by 157 designers from all around the world. Among the contributors are award winning designers such as Jean-François Porchez, Jessica Hische, Erik Spiekermann, Martina Flor, Tobias Frere-Jones, Hannes von Doehren, Erin McLaughlin, Erik van Blokland, Petr van Blokland,  Martin Majoor, Neil Summerour, Toshi Omagari, and David Berlow. Arabic designers include Mamoun Sakkal, Bahia Shehab, Pascal Zoghbi, Khajag Apelian, Wael Morcos, Yara Khoury, Kristyan Sarkis, and Maha Akl.</p>
<p>The font includes decorative isolated Arabic letters and Latin capitals as well as Arabic numerals and a few symbols, all in one font file, together symbolising the solidarity of the international community with Beirut and its people.</p>

<li>By supporting this campaign you will get a working font with over 300 decorative glyphs and the option to acquire a set of catalogue and postcards printed in Beirut.</li>

<ul>
<li>Shipping costs are significant. It might have been easier to just print in the UK, but it meant a lot to be able to print at home, and for people around the world to get postcards that say: printed in Beirut. This way we show support to local businesses, and send the message that no matter what happens, Beirut carries on, and its renowned presses will not stop. Not for war, and not for explosions. Beirut lives on. </li>
<li>The financial hurdles for sending money to Lebanese charities are many, given the banking crisis, and the imminent lockdown due to Covid-19. The campaign will continue to vet different routes to overcome that and consult with tax advisers for best possible avenues. We will post regular updates on the progress.</li>

The Lêstrada Free Art Festival, will aim the development of an organic activity, where the public - through an open call - will offer possibilities of cultural and artistic interventions, seminars, talks, free perfomances, shows, etc. We want to, emphatically, touch themes as independent production, hybrid art, affection, gender and surviving.Belém is a city where the majority of the population does not have access to art and culture activities, in addiction, there is a clear anti-culture policy by the capital authorities which choose to chase, deny and suffocate multiples cultural movements and expressions, whether they are from the street or either from the most institutionalized, through a severe cut in the fundings for art policies.

As a fine artist in one of the world's primary cultural and artistic hubs, I am one of many who can speak to the difficulty of having one's work exhibited, let alone purchased. This coming May my wife, Isis, and I will be moving back to Seattle, Washington. We both grew up in the Puget Sound and have enjoyed our experiences in New York and around the globe over the last decade. With us comes a body of artwork to join the pieces I have created over the last several years back home, ready for exhibition and purchase.</p><p>I am unsatisfied with merely championing my own work and have reached out to several up and coming artists in the Seattle area. These are people I grew up with and who have finally been able to step out of art as a hobby to careers as artists. They are supporters of arts, culture, and community as I am. As such, we want to be part of the effort to keep money flowing within our community through dynamic and creative projects. SEXPUG (Seattle Exposure Pop Up Gallery) is an attempt to do just that.</p><h3><b><i>What We Need &amp; What You Get</i></b></h3><p>By meeting our $10,000 minimum goal, we aim to achieve the following:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Rent a suitable retail space for a period of 2 months, with insurance. Areas of interest are currently Pioneer Square and Greenwood, due to their wonderful art walks.</li>
<li>Provide a weekly rotation of exhibitions, while allowing for continued display of remaining artworks</li>

Taking the burden of rent and other associated exhibition costs from us, you are freeing us to be more creative and less demanding in our pricing.

Pop up galleries are proving to be a successful way of providing artists and business owners alike to turn empty spaces into objects and areas of wonder, bringing aesthetic and commercial interests for the benefit of the community at hand. Our aim to be seen in areas already popular for their art walks and exhibitions should greatly improve the odds of success.</p><p>Crowdfunding works, too, as my successful KOI School campaign of 2013 can attest. With the support of my social network, I was able to raise over $3000 to purchase the supplies (canvases, paints, etc) for 12 new works, ready to be seen at my SEXPUG exhibition opening.

<p>ArtiPeeps invites you to help us fund an important element in our latest large-scale combined arts project The Nine Realms.</p>
<p>From today, for the next 30 days, woodcarver
 Mark Crowley will be <b>LIVE CARVING </b>a Viking boat made from mahogany and oak, which will 
act as the focal point and heart of a 5-day <b>Norse-inspired Interactive
 Combined Arts experience</b> to be held between 11th-15th September 2015 in Hanse House, King's Lynn, Norfolk, UK.  Our project is  a continuation of  the <b> '<a href=""http://www.visitwestnorfolk.com/explore/kings-lynn/history/hanseatic-kings-lynn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2015 Year of the Hanse</a>'</b> celebrations and the National Heritage Open Day in Norfolk and England.  It is our intention to take the whole experience (and the 
boat) on tour: locally, nationally and internationally.<br/></p>
<p>Bringing to life the 9 realms of Norse mythology,  The Nine Realms pulls 
together <b>45 talented creatives</b> from around the UK and the world who have
 worked together online for over 9 months celebrating the myths, 
characters and stories from the 13th century Icelandic Norse Sagas through poetry, 
writing, art and music. <br/></p>
<div>Please
 donate to help ArtiPeeps fully fund this project and cover Mark's woodcarving commission costs, and in so doing contribute to the creation of a unique art piece that will travel the world.</div>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Every 4 days (or less) Mark will be sending us live updates from his studio in Newcastle, UK.

</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The boat's shape and movement will be inspired by the project poetry. Poetry will be carved on to the boat's surface and organically inform the whole creative process. As Mark put it: <i>'<b>It's a poem about a boat, made from a boat!'</b></i></span>
</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Throughout the course of the 30 days we will be witnessing the creation of a unique piece of art, which acts as a physical reminder of the oral tradition of the Norse Sagas. </span>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">In a very real way our boat will be</span><b style=""background-color: initial;""> the heart of the regular participatory poetry readings</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> and realm tours we will run for the </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">1000+ members of the general public </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">across the 5 days;  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">and for the pupils attending our project Schools' day.  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  Our boat is also a </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">symbol of connectivity </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">as participants meet for the first time.

</div><div><br/></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Across the Schools' Day, and at the beginning of each poetry reading throughout the 5 days, people will gather around our Viking boat  as an initial meeting point.

</div><div>From the end of April <b><a href=""http://millfieldschool.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Millfield School Somerset</a></b> pupils will be creating Norse inspired poetry, which will be posted out on ArtiPeeps and go on our multimedia DVD, supporting young poets too.</div><div><br/></div><div>Two local schools will be attending our Schools' Day.</div><div>

VIKINGS AHOY!

ArtiPeeps invites you to help us fund an important element in our latest large-scale combined arts project The Nine Realms.
From today, for the next 30 days, woodcarver
 Mark Crowley will be LIVE CARVING a Viking boat made from mahogany and oak, which will 
act as the focal point and heart of a 5-day Norse-inspired Interactive
 Combined Arts experience to be held between 11th-15th September 2015 in Hanse House, King's Lynn, Norfolk, UK.  Our project is  a continuation of  the  '2015 Year of the Hanse' celebrations and the National Heritage Open Day in Norfolk and England.  It is our intention to take the whole experience (and the 
boat) on tour: locally, nationally and internationally.
Bringing to life the 9 realms of Norse mythology,  The Nine Realms pulls 
together 45 talented creatives from around the UK and the world who have
 worked together online for over 9 months celebrating the myths, 
characters and stories from the 13th century Icelandic Norse Sagas through poetry, 
writing, art and music. 
Please
 donate to help ArtiPeeps fully fund this project and cover Mark's woodcarving commission costs, and in so doing contribute to the creation of a unique art piece that will travel the world.

Stop Press! Exciting News! 


We had some exciting news on the 8th April:  we have been partially funded by Arts Council England and Norfolk County Council.  We need your help for the last funding push! 
      



What's going to happen over the next 30 Days:


Every 4 days (or less) Mark will be sending us live updates from his studio in Newcastle, UK. We will be posting up the sculpture's progress with new photographs and videos. Together we will see our boat emerge from the beautiful piece of mahogany from which he has chosen to carve the boat and the ash from which he is carving the prow.

The boat's shape and movement will be inspired by the project poetry. Poetry will be carved on to the boat's surface and organically inform the whole creative process. As Mark put it: 'It's a poem about a boat, made from a boat!'

Throughout the course of the 30 days we will be witnessing the creation of a unique piece of art, which acts as a physical reminder of the oral tradition of the Norse Sagas. 

In a very real way our boat will be the heart of the regular participatory poetry readings and realm tours we will run for the 1000+ members of the general public across the 5 days;  and for the pupils attending our project Schools' day.    Our boat is also a symbol of connectivity as participants meet for the first time. It is a celebration of a powerful virtual global collaborative process which is now coming to fruition in real-time.  We'd like to invite you into this celebration.

When and Where: 
11th-15th September, Hanse House, South Quay, King's Lynn, Norfolk, with Special Schools Day and Workshops (poetry and art). 

And: 

14th September, Participant lead Open Mic Poetry reading at The Norfolk and Norwich Millennium Library , Norwich.

nb. In between times our boat will reside at Hanse House on public display.

Featuring: 

19 poets and writers, 23 artists and 3 musicians 

Poets and Artists biographies

Premieres: 


36 new poems and writings,  19 new diverse realm artworks (from Asgard to Alfheim)


9 new specially commissioned pieces of realm music


Bespoke 9 Realms Viking Minecraft World  Designed by Adam Clarke responsible for #TateWorlds for Tate Modern


4 page Ragnarök comic created by two American artists from Washington and Florida in the USA

EDUCATIONAL IMPACT:

          
    Wonderful engagement, Pictures, of last year's Schools' Day, 2014

All the large-scale projects that ArtiPeeps runs feed off our online initiatives and have an educational remit. We aim to provide a vibrant variety of access points to epic pieces of literature like the Norse Sagas through the combined arts. Enhancing audience enjoyment through the use of comics, music, Minecraft and active participation.  Music and Minecraft are the final two elements of a combined arts template we wish to use in all our projects to come. 

We believe in the importance of lifelong learning and in the value of interaction and expression- hence our emphasis on participatory poetry reading, and our first-time use of Minecraft. We want to involve and inspire the public, pupils and schools with whom we work.  The 13th century Icelandic Norse Sagas, particularly The Prose and Poetic Eddas, have played a vital role in the way we tell stories today ,and in our poetic traditions.  We hope that through the new poetry, art and music we have created that these historic myths and characters can be re-imagined for new audiences.

Across the Schools' Day, and at the beginning of each poetry reading throughout the 5 days, people will gather around our Viking boat  as an initial meeting point. We want to create a magical multi-sensory experience, so there will be a starry sky above and the Northern lights falling across 'The Gallery' floor too.
From the end of April Millfield School Somerset pupils will be creating Norse inspired poetry, which will be posted out on ArtiPeeps and go on our multimedia DVD, supporting young poets too.Two local schools will be attending our Schools' Day.
'Many thanks for your email. ArtiPeeps looks like a very impressive venture! I’ve had a good look at the website and am blown away by the variety and quality of the work on it. I’d love our pupils to be able to showcase some of their work on your site,' James
Baddock, Millfield School, Somerset, Head of English, Drama &
Media   www.millfieldschool.com


ARTIPEEPS:

    

                   ArtiPeeps is a collaborative creativity and well-being not-for-profit organisation and website which was started in 2012. We specialise in the facilitation of large-scale projects which showcase global poets, artists and musicians, and introduce epic pieces of literature to new audiences and schools. Our purpose is to nurture creativity and well-being through collaboration. We also run a variety of individual online and collaborative showcasing initiatives. We also have an interest in mental health which underpins everything we do. Core values:  Respect, Collaboration, Communication, Integrity, Care
Our last project, Transformations (inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses), was also co-funded by Arts Council England and Norfolk County Council.

https://artipeeps.wordpress.com
""Creativity generates well-being. Within nearly twelve months of collaborating with various writers & visual artists, ArtiPeeps has provided a formidable platform for allowing both inner spirit & work to explore new corners and connect with kindred spirits. So far, it has been both a challenging and highly enjoyable adventure!""  Nat Hall, participating poet  about 'Transformations'. 



With the introduction of the elements of Minecraft and Music, The Nine Realms, represents the combined arts template we hope to use in all our future ArtiPeeps projects. With the belief that through a unique sensory mix of art forms  we can create a variety of imaginative access points to complex material for all age ranges. One that moves people away from merely 'attending' to 'participating'.

<p><b>The Magic of the Top</b><br/></p>
<p>1.  The top would also be perfect with a vegan leather pencil skirt or skinny pants or worn over your dresses for a creatively stylish layered look.  <br/></p>

<p>4.  For an effortless weekend outfit, pair it with your favorite jeans or cut-off shorts.  </p>

</div></div>","Welcome to The Third Annual Trans Calendar Project! We are a collective of artists and activists striving to empower trans* people across North America and the world. Our annual calendar gives us a platform to represent ourselves as trans individuals through our own eyes, making visible a diversity of people and raising awareness about the realities of our lives and communities. 
___________________________________________________________________________






DIVERSITY Representation gives trans people the varied, positive role models they need. It shows the rest of the world that we are just as diverse as everyone else, and we want to celebrate that! One byproduct of this is a nurturing of community amongst trans* people of all ages, identities and walks of life. 
SOLIDARITY We don't do this alone. Without the financial help of people like you, our calendar does not get made. Our team of seven trans* artists have already completed all of the photography, illustration and design and we've begun the process of proofing for print. This Indiegogo campaign allows us to cover the costs of printing and production, and without it- we can't go to press. 

COMMUNITY 100% of our profits support trans* people and communities directly. You help us provide trans* artists with paid work as well as a way to proudly display art which they have full control over. 50% of our profits are used towards our project needs and goals- of which community building is a big one.  
FUNDRAISING In addition, the other 50% of our profits are split up between any of our project members in need to put towards their gender transitions- helping them to significantly improve their quality of life. We take care of each other. 
(We define trans* people as anyone whose gender identity does not match the identity they were assigned at birth.) SUPPORT THE TRANS CALENDAR PROJECT! ____________________________________________________________________________Make this project happen! DONATE. Because this project does not happen without your support, to say THANKS we have some special offers just for crowdfunding backers! We are offering our calendar for pre-sale at a special reduced price, and we've got some amazing limited edition perks, too!

<p><b>What is this project all about?</b></p>
<p>Photography is
a portal into the imagination of the photographer, which can be uniquely interpreted
by each individual who sees it. <i>Black,
White and Colour</i> explores portraiture, landscape and fine art by delving
into classic compositions and abstract creations. With your support I can move,
touch and inspire all those who visit the exhibition free of charge.</p>
<p>Not only is <i>Black, White and Colour</i> taking place in
one of Auckland City’s most unique and intriguing industrial spaces, it
presents a carefully selected array of images that will arouse the viewer’s
curiosity. After carrying out my own journey, I became a passionate and enthusiastic
photographer. The photographs in <i>Black,
White and Colour </i>demonstrate the potential that photography has to
change the way we see the world. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/915053/files/20141008125455-IMG_1538-Edit-2.JPG?1412798095"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b><i>What this exhibition aims to
achieve</i></b> is a display
of images that lets the audience engage, without any restrictions; breaking
down boundaries between people and art. The magic of this photography is that
it contains insight into the way I see the world and can be interpreted by the
audience regardless of who they are and where they come from. These images will
connect people in a unique way based on their own personal perspectives. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/915057/files/20141008125602-Lily_Composite.JPG?1412798162"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>Your Chance To Be Part of Something Great</b></p>
<p>To ignite the
magic and enable this exhibition to take flight, it needs your support in
preparation for lift off. </p>
<p>The funds
raised from this campaign will be the source of life for the exhibition and
enable it to travel from the initial venue to other exciting public spaces
around the world. It would be an incredible opportunity to be able to bring this
vision to life. By making this exhibition available to spectators for free,
people can take time out of their busy lives to enjoy, to engage and to be
inspired by these photographs through their own eyes.</p>
<p><i>This exhibition will bring people together
and showcase the beauty that our world has to offer. </i></p>
<p>By
contributing to this project, you are bringing change to the way people interact
with art and each other. The context of an artwork can dramatically affect the
way that creation is interpreted. Silo 6 is a space that commands attention and
by exhibiting <i>Black, White and Colour </i>in
this setting, I seek to conjure distinct responses to my work. The crisp photographs
echo the architectural space of Silo 6.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/915060/files/20141008125627-IMG_6208-Edit.JPG?1412798187"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>A Photographer Worth Helping</b></p>

<p>“Thank you Ilan
for sharing your moving and very timely portraits with me. Your empathy with
your subjects and your photographic treatment of them shows not only an

photographic journey 
My name is
Ilan Wittenberg and I am the photographer behind these eye-opening photographs.
This campaign endeavours to get a phenomenal project off the ground by raising
funds to enable me to exhibit my work and to allow the spark that photography
ignites in my spirit to be shared with everyone. “You don't take a photograph, you make it” - Ansel AdamsThe Budget
A project
that touches people in a profound way means a lot of passion and enthusiasm is
involved. These images were born from a unique perspective. However, to enable
individuals to be exposed to my artwork and the ideas behind those creations, I
have to raise funds, which will enable the exhibition to happen. Below are the
estimated costs.

“The two most important days in your life are the day you were born
and the day you find out why” – Mark Twain
What is this project all about?
Photography is
a portal into the imagination of the photographer, which can be uniquely interpreted
by each individual who sees it. Black,
White and Colour explores portraiture, landscape and fine art by delving
into classic compositions and abstract creations. With your support I can move,
touch and inspire all those who visit the exhibition free of charge.
Not only is Black, White and Colour taking place in
one of Auckland City’s most unique and intriguing industrial spaces, it
presents a carefully selected array of images that will arouse the viewer’s
curiosity. After carrying out my own journey, I became a passionate and enthusiastic
photographer. The photographs in Black,
White and Colour demonstrate the potential that photography has to
change the way we see the world. What this exhibition aims to
achieve is a display
of images that lets the audience engage, without any restrictions; breaking
down boundaries between people and art. The magic of this photography is that
it contains insight into the way I see the world and can be interpreted by the
audience regardless of who they are and where they come from. These images will
connect people in a unique way based on their own personal perspectives. Your Chance To Be Part of Something Great
To ignite the
magic and enable this exhibition to take flight, it needs your support in
preparation for lift off. 
The funds
raised from this campaign will be the source of life for the exhibition and
enable it to travel from the initial venue to other exciting public spaces
around the world. It would be an incredible opportunity to be able to bring this
vision to life. By making this exhibition available to spectators for free,
people can take time out of their busy lives to enjoy, to engage and to be
inspired by these photographs through their own eyes.
This exhibition will bring people together
and showcase the beauty that our world has to offer. 
By
contributing to this project, you are bringing change to the way people interact
with art and each other. The context of an artwork can dramatically affect the
way that creation is interpreted. Silo 6 is a space that commands attention and
by exhibiting Black, White and Colour in
this setting, I seek to conjure distinct responses to my work. The crisp photographs
echo the architectural space of Silo 6.A Photographer Worth Helping
It is a wonderful sentiment to hear the
enthusiasm and joy photography can bring to our lives; here are some of the feelings that my work
has brought to others: 
“Thank you Ilan
for sharing your moving and very timely portraits with me. Your empathy with
your subjects and your photographic treatment of them shows not only an
understanding of the veterans but also the connection you made with them and
the trust they show in you as their photographer. Congratulations on this relevant
body of work.”
Clive Bartleet Art (Photography) –
Assistant HOD, Rangitoto College
“Ilan skillfully
managed to capture precious moments at our special family event, bringing with
him not just the camera but passion, sense of humor, patience and love. A true
artist with a camera, Ilan created beautiful photos that are joyful to watch
again and again!”
Carmit and Shai Aharon
 ”Ilan is an exceptionally talented
photographer who maintains a high level of professionalism and customer
service. He listens to customer preferences and desired outcomes and applies
his skill set with focus and humour to deliver beautiful pictures. His
portfolio of work ranges from high art to professional portraits, all handled
with care and respect for the customer.”

“Ilan is the most

exemplary service in a great studio whilst making you feel completely relaxed.
His work is outstanding. Pure talent.” 
Hannah SindenAwardsI have been
lucky enough to be recognized for my passion for photography by winning awards. These have encouraged me to take my photography to the next
level, to pursue my dream and to exhibit my work.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I delved into the world of plants and herbs during my last semester at Massachusetts College of Art + Design in 2012. since then I have worked at Tower Hill Botanic Garden, in Boylston MA then moved on to the Southwest and have been landscaping, studying herbalism, and working in a Nursery since 2015.</p>
<p>while in New Mexico I designed the Tarot of Plants, a tarot deck that had been in the back of my mind since early 2012. in October 2015 i finally made that vision a reality, and with the help of a previous indiegogo fundraiser was able to get the amount in the bank to start off my first order (it's really pricey to get a 78 card deck printed!).</p>
<p>since the deck has been released I've had numerous opportunities open up, allowing me to finally fully immerse myself into the art/retail/mystical world of my dreams. three years later i'm itching to create something new, but i can't do it without your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>like i said above, printing tarot cards isn't cheap.</p>
<p>right now the black decks, with a hard box and poker-sized cards cost $1385 for 100. this is a smaller sized deck than your standard tarot cards, and it doesn't include any informational booklet (there are two cards included that give a breif description of some of the information on the cards, all the card meanings are online for free, or you can order a $4 PDF or $8 print book for all the information in one spot).</p>
<p>in making this full-color deck i want to have it be more luxurious and ornate compared to the casual nature of the previous cards.</p>
<p>things that will be added to the full-color Tarot of Plants:</p>
<ul>
<li>watercolor plant illustrations</li>
<li>full Tarot-sized Deck (2.75""x4.75"")</li>
<li>informational booklet- will include what the information the 2 instruction cards had on it as well as a brief cheat sheet for the 78 card meanings.</li>
<li>gold edging on the cards</li>
</ul>
<p>with all these editions it easily raises the cost for 100 decks to over $2000</p>
<p>once printed, the decks will go for $59/each or $35 wholesale, and with the success of the previous deck i am confident once they're out in the world i will be able to sustain the cost/demand.</p>
<p>however, in order for me to have the free time to <i>be</i> a creative person, half the year i choose to  have a very minimal lifestyle. Taos is a wonderful place with both the charms of a big city but the feel of rural life- and sadly the job opportunities are often scarce. Without the help of indiegogo to create a pre-sale campaign i don't have the $2100 to invest upfront.</p>
<p>if i do not reach my goal any money raised will go towards buying the decks and i will attempt to find the money for the difference- it will just affect my planned release dates, and cause me to possibly miss the holiday buying season</p>
<p>any additional money will go towards stocking more product for the holiday season (Black/white decks, tarot guides, and hopefully new Totes, and a new crystal guide).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>right now I have sold over 300 decks via etsy, and am in 10+ shops around the country.</p>
<p>Everyday Magic in Durham, NC has been a powerhouse of selling, and 4 shops have signed on this year alone. I have also branched out to do Tarot Reading events and Classes in both Massachusetts &amp; New Mexico and hope to travel to other areas and do the same.</p>
<p>ever since i raised the first $800 needed to release the first deck, i have been keeping the business self-sustaining. in the past year i have gotten better at having the money on hand for the next order, however it is tricky for me to come up with the larger sums to start new projects.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>the biggest challenge for me is the finances. i haven't looked into (and honestly shy away from) any kind of business loans that could help me get the large sum together that could finance a foundation and variety of products i could have on hand.</p>
<p>the ""work two (or three) job"" route is one that is quite familiar to me, for years and years i tried this approach. when i moved out to New Mexico i took the opportunity to take a step back, and change this outlook- allowing myself more free time, and being more creative with my income (odd jobs, etsy, etc.) and i have found myself to be more productive.</p>
<p>however i manage to do a lot on very little. even if this campaign doesn't raise the money i need i am confident i have the discipline and drive to make it happen....</p>
<p>....it just might not be until fall 2019</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>if you can't financially help there's still plenty you can do!</p>
<p>you can share this campaign, or even my etsy! you can request local shops in your area that my deck would fit in with! you can even just send me a message saying ""i support you"". follow on instagram or facebook- there's still so much you can do!</p>

right now the black decks, with a hard box and poker-sized cards cost $1385 for 100. this is a smaller sized deck than your standard tarot cards, and it doesn't include any informational booklet (there are two cards included that give a breif description of some of the information on the cards, all the card meanings are online for free, or you can order a $4 PDF or $8 print book for all the information in one spot).
in making this full-color deck i want to have it be more luxurious and ornate compared to the casual nature of the previous cards.
things that will be added to the full-color Tarot of Plants:

watercolor plant illustrations
full Tarot-sized Deck (2.75""x4.75"")
informational booklet- will include what the information the 2 instruction cards had on it as well as a brief cheat sheet for the 78 card meanings.
gold edging on the cards

with all these editions it easily raises the cost for 100 decks to over $2000
once printed, the decks will go for $59/each or $35 wholesale, and with the success of the previous deck i am confident once they're out in the world i will be able to sustain the cost/demand.
however, in order for me to have the free time to be a creative person, half the year i choose to  have a very minimal lifestyle. Taos is a wonderful place with both the charms of a big city but the feel of rural life- and sadly the job opportunities are often scarce. Without the help of indiegogo to create a pre-sale campaign i don't have the $2100 to invest upfront.
if i do not reach my goal any money raised will go towards buying the decks and i will attempt to find the money for the difference- it will just affect my planned release dates, and cause me to possibly miss the holiday buying season
any additional money will go towards stocking more product for the holiday season (Black/white decks, tarot guides, and hopefully new Totes, and a new crystal guide).
 

The Impact
right now I have sold over 300 decks via etsy, and am in 10+ shops around the country.
Everyday Magic in Durham, NC has been a powerhouse of selling, and 4 shops have signed on this year alone. I have also branched out to do Tarot Reading events and Classes in both Massachusetts & New Mexico and hope to travel to other areas and do the same.
ever since i raised the first $800 needed to release the first deck, i have been keeping the business self-sustaining. in the past year i have gotten better at having the money on hand for the next order, however it is tricky for me to come up with the larger sums to start new projects.
 

Risks & Challenges
the biggest challenge for me is the finances. i haven't looked into (and honestly shy away from) any kind of business loans that could help me get the large sum together that could finance a foundation and variety of products i could have on hand.
the ""work two (or three) job"" route is one that is quite familiar to me, for years and years i tried this approach. when i moved out to New Mexico i took the opportunity to take a step back, and change this outlook- allowing myself more free time, and being more creative with my income (odd jobs, etsy, etc.) and i have found myself to be more productive.
however i manage to do a lot on very little. even if this campaign doesn't raise the money i need i am confident i have the discipline and drive to make it happen....
....it just might not be until fall 2019

<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">HELP BIG ORBIT GALLERY FUND THEIR NEXT MAJOR MULTI-MEDIA INSTALLATION</strong></h3>
<p>BIG ORBIT GALLERY is a registered not-for-profit art gallery located in Buffalo, NY. We are Buffalo's only true experimental art space and we need your support. Help us maintain our tradition of supporting underrepresented artists and the avant-garde. As public funding for the arts continues to dry up, your support becomes increasingly important. Donate now! All contributions, regardless of the goal, will go towards the production of this project. </p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>A STRANGER IN THE STREET AT THE EDGE OF THE EARTH is a large-scale multi-media installation by DAVID MITCHELL, in collaboration with JOSEPH STOCKER of the band SON OF THE SUN, scheduled to debut during SPRING 2014 at BIG ORBIT GALLERY in Buffalo, NY, then travel to the HVCCA in Peekskill for Fall 2014, with two other venues currently in the works. The project is a large-scale sculpture, combined with multiple film based works, and digital programming, that culminates in a performative musical experience.</p>
<p><span><strong>THE INSTALLATION</strong> is a room sized sculptural environment consisting of an instrument called a mellotron, made from MIDI controlled 16mm film projectors, and three life sized wolf sculptures prowling around a car. Inside the car's cockpit there will be a holographic projection of the universe and suspended above the car a large mirror ball. The mellotron will be output through amplifiers that will surround the sculpture. </span><span>Throughout the course of the exhibition there will be a series of live performances featuring Joseph Stocker playing the 16mm mellotron, accompanied by other guest performers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>CHECK OUT THE </span><strong>GALLERY</strong><span> TAB AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE FOR MOCK-UPS AND VIDEOS.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>THE INSTRUMENT </strong>is a mellotron type synthesizer constructed out of twelve 16mm optical sound film projectors. Each film will have a tone or sample recorded to its soundtrack representing a single note within the twelve-tone scale. Each film will also contain visual information, short narrative vignettes and scenes, which will loop in various durations. The projectors will be controlled by a MIDI keyboard connected to special MIDI interfaces that will allow the projectors to be powered by corresponding keys on the keyboard. If the note A# is played on the keyboard, the projector containing the film with the A# tone will begin to play, so on and so forth. Chords, rhythms, and/or a variety of samples will form the composition via the triggering of multiple projectors.</p>
<p>The projectors will be output to guitar amplifiers, each outfitted with a set of effects processors. Manipulation of the instrument to create musical compositions will be carried out in two ways: through the physical playing of the MIDI keyboard itself and/or by manipulation of the processors connected to the amplifiers. Since MIDI is programmable, via computer software, the instrument will be capable of playing a pre-recorded musical program without the presence of the composer. This will allow manipulation of the effects processors in real time, as an improvisational tool, or to preset the processors for a variety of compositional possibilities.</p>
<p>JOSEPH STOCKER will write the score for the films using the instrument. His composition will dictate the order in which the films play.</p>
<p><strong>THE FILMS</strong> will feature critically acclaimed stage actor TIM NEWELL. They address themes of fear, God, nature, death, and the universe; themes that have been at the forefront of philosophical thought since the beginning of humanity. Though rapid advances in science and technology have heightened our knowledge of the cosmos, these are still times of uncertainty. The intention is to provide a contemporary context, using a visual language akin to the standard movie trailer or music video, to address classical existential themes that are equally relevant today as they were thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>The protagonist (TIM NEWELL) believes that he can hear communications from the moon. The moon communicates through infrasound via the tides. He is unaware of the cause, whether alien, God, or the moon itself as a living entity. This causes an existential dilemma, and what appears to be obsessive and irrational behavior. The protagonist can’t distinguish whether it is real or imagined. The moon begins to affect wolves, dogs, and coyotes. They follow the protagonist but it is unclear whether they are chasing him or if he is leading the pack.</p>
<p>The film is cut into a series of 12 discreet scenes, or shots, with no distinguishable order; it is fractured and nonlinear. This is analogous to the protagonist’s psychological condition.</p>
<p><strong>THE PERFORMANCES</strong> will take place throughout the course of the exhibition. JOSEPH STOCKER, along with a variety of invited musicians, will perform with the instrument, either improvisationally or rehearsed. The pre-programmed musical score will be accompanied with live instruments during each performance. Some performances will feature the live manipulation of the instrument. Throughout the course of the exhibition, during normal gallery hours, the pre-programmed score will play so that visitors can experience the installation in a more intimate setting. A schedule of performances and guests will be determined at a later date</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING </strong>for the larger elements, in part, will be provided by CEPA and BIG ORBIT GALLERY through NYSCA and other granting agencies. Grants have also been submitted to HARPO FOUNDATION and NYSCA’s INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS PROGRAM for FILM AND INTERACTIVE MEDIA.</p>
<h3><strong>YOUR HELP IS NEEDED!</strong></h3>
<p>The total budget for equipment, supplies, filming, and production is projected to be over $20,000.The more we can raise through crowd-funding the less we have to rely on grants and the easier it will be to afford additional guest performers, travel expenses, artists fees, and support for the gallery.</p>
<p><strong>SO KEEP GIVING BEYOND THE GOAL! </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>WHAT YOU'LL GET</strong></h2>
<p>For supporting the project we have decided to give incentives for certain donation levels. Consider your donations as a pre-release purchase of some really great artwork.</p>

<h2><strong>FLIP - <em>Fertility Love Inspiration Potential</em></strong></h2>
<h2>FLIP will be an 8 foot diameter steel mandala that can be FLIP'd over on a central axis. Primarily composed of hand plasma-cut sheet metal, fabricated and welded to a curved steel frame, the mandala will glisten in the sun. By night it comes alive with bright internal illumination, casting intricate patterns on the surface of the playa.  Embracing sacred geometry, this mandala is a window into the soul, holding space for pARTicipants in the complex universe that surrounds us.  People are encouraged to view the sacred proportions and meditate on their own relationship to the world around them. Step up, create intention, FLIP it, and launch the next season of your personal journey.  FLIP will be an easy to move, interactive, human powered kinetic sculpture.</h2>

<h3> About the artists</h3>
<p>   After meeting at Burning Man in 2009, the team of Ruby Bettencourt and Jeff Howe quickly discovered that they shared not only a common desire to create, but also a similar sense of aesthetics and intentions.<img alt=""Ruby and Jeff at Totem BM 2012"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/417522_230972473654230_1157172035_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Artists at BM 2012""/></p>
<p>    </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ruby, a seventeen year veteran burner, has a background in jewelery and fashion design, and Jeff is a building designer.  Meeting in the middle between small scale jewelery and large public school buildings, they decided they would make art that combined thier talents while embracing a sense of the sacred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     For Burning Man 2010 they created thier first steel sculpture together, The Kranok.  Inspired by the Metropolis theme and based on a Thai <img alt=""The Kranok in Red"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/334117_338918769526266_671031242_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px 8px; float: left;"" title=""Kranok by Jeff Howe and Ruby Bettencourt""/>achitectural motif it represented the burning out of our human passions.   Over the summer it was featured at the SF Decompression, Lighting in a Bottle, and Harmony Festival. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>     </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>     In 2011 they decided to make larger art and seek Burning Man playa placement for their next piece, the Totem.  <img alt=""Totem at BM 2011"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/338400_170363669715111_64354689_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px 8px; float: left;"" title=""Totem by Jeff Howe and Ruby Bettencourt""/>Seven recycled steel drums, each animal totem representing a Rite of Passage, it rose 21 feet over the playa with an 8 foot steel wingspan at the top.  The symbolic totem pole was very well recieved and has also been touring festivals.  Weighing half a ton and primarily funded by the artists, both Jeff and Ruby relentlesly worked for more than 500 hours to manifest their dream. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>    Again, they have dreams to make a large steel piece for Burning Man 2012, but the cost of the materials, transportation, lighting, etc., are quickly growing beyond what they can reasonably contribute. </p>
<p>     </p>
<p>Your generous donations will help to keep the momentum of their creative dance going strong.  They hope that with enough funding they will be able to offset the cost of materials, transportation, and some of the tools required for their work to continue.</p>
<p>Some of the items that your donations will help provide include:</p>
<p>Nearly 1000 pounds of steel</p>
<p>Pillow block bearings</p>
<p>Lighting system</p>
<p>Deep cell batteries and solar recharge system</p>
<p>Structural welding and custom machining</p>

<h2>FLIP - <em>Fertility Love Inspiration Potential</em>
</h2>
</div></div>","FLIP - Fertility Love Inspiration Potential
FLIP will be an 8 foot diameter steel mandala that can be FLIP'd over on a central axis. Primarily composed of hand plasma-cut sheet metal, fabricated and welded to a curved steel frame, the mandala will glisten in the sun. By night it comes alive with bright internal illumination, casting intricate patterns on the surface of the playa.  Embracing sacred geometry, this mandala is a window into the soul, holding space for pARTicipants in the complex universe that surrounds us.  People are encouraged to view the sacred proportions and meditate on their own relationship to the world around them. Step up, create intention, FLIP it, and launch the next season of your personal journey.  FLIP will be an easy to move, interactive, human powered kinetic sculpture.
 
 About the artists
   After meeting at Burning Man in 2009, the team of Ruby Bettencourt and Jeff Howe quickly discovered that they shared not only a common desire to create, but also a similar sense of aesthetics and intentions.
    
 
 
Ruby, a seventeen year veteran burner, has a background in jewelery and fashion design, and Jeff is a building designer.  Meeting in the middle between small scale jewelery and large public school buildings, they decided they would make art that combined thier talents while embracing a sense of the sacred.
 
     For Burning Man 2010 they created thier first steel sculpture together, The Kranok.  Inspired by the Metropolis theme and based on a Thai achitectural motif it represented the burning out of our human passions.   Over the summer it was featured at the SF Decompression, Lighting in a Bottle, and Harmony Festival. 
 
     
 
 
     In 2011 they decided to make larger art and seek Burning Man playa placement for their next piece, the Totem.  Seven recycled steel drums, each animal totem representing a Rite of Passage, it rose 21 feet over the playa with an 8 foot steel wingspan at the top.  The symbolic totem pole was very well recieved and has also been touring festivals.  Weighing half a ton and primarily funded by the artists, both Jeff and Ruby relentlesly worked for more than 500 hours to manifest their dream. 
 
 
    Again, they have dreams to make a large steel piece for Burning Man 2012, but the cost of the materials, transportation, lighting, etc., are quickly growing beyond what they can reasonably contribute. 
     
Your generous donations will help to keep the momentum of their creative dance going strong.  They hope that with enough funding they will be able to offset the cost of materials, transportation, and some of the tools required for their work to continue.
Some of the items that your donations will help provide include:
Nearly 1000 pounds of steel
Pillow block bearings
Lighting system
Deep cell batteries and solar recharge system
Structural welding and custom machining
Plasma cutting and welding consumables
Rented workshop space
Rental of a truck and trailer to transport it to and from Burning Man 2012
And also a ton of other small expenses associated with the creation and delivery of a project of this scope


After you have made your contribution please tell your friends, family, neighbors, that rich uncle you have not spoken to in years... about this endeavor.  Please share this on your facebook or twitter, hand it out in the office, hang a sign in a window, or whatever other creative way you can think of to help get the word out.

honor all of America's war dead. In describing it, Borglum said ""The
design represents a great spearhead. Upon the green field of this spearhead we
have placed a Tudor sword, the hilt of which represents the American nation at
a crisis, answering the call to arms."" The “Wars of America” sculpture was

</div></div>","Short Summary 
The Military Park Partnership is pleased to announce the “Adopt-A-Monument” program – an exciting initiative to preserve Newark’s artistic and cultural heritage by focusing on Military Park’s collection of some of the finest nineteenth- and twentieth-century American sculptures, with major works by Gutzon Borglum, Henry Kirke Brown, Jacques Lipchitz, and Karl Gerhardt. Subjected to pollution, vandalism, neglect, and environmental erosion, these treasures have lost their original splendor. They have been identified as needing immediate attention.
The City cannot undertake this mission alone. 
You can read more about this campaign here, or at MilitaryPark.com

What We Need
 Here are summaries of the four monuments to be restored, and the costs associated with cleaning and restoring them:




“Wars of America” by Gutzon
Borglum: (John) Gutzon de la Mothe
Borglum(March 25, 1867 – March 6, 1941) was a Danish-American artist and sculptor famous for creating the monumental presidents' heads at Mount Rushmore,
South Dakota, the famous carving on Stone Mountain near Atlanta (he later destroyed it in protest to the KKK’s
involvement), as well as other public works of
art including a head of Abraham Lincoln, exhibited in Theodore Roosevelt's White House and
held in the United States Capitol Crypt in Washington, D.C. “Wars of America”is
a ""colossal"" bronze sculpturecontaining
""forty-two humans and two horses"". The sculpture sets on a base of
granite fromStone Mountain. The
sculpture was erected in 1926, eight years afterWorld War Iended, but its intent was broadened to
honor all of America's war dead. In describing it, Borglum said ""The
design represents a great spearhead. Upon the green field of this spearhead we
have placed a Tudor sword, the hilt of which represents the American nation at
a crisis, answering the call to arms."" The “Wars of America” sculpture was
added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 1994.

1973) was a Cubist sculptor.  In the artistic communities of Montmartre and Montparnasse,
he joined a group of artists that included Juan Gris
and Pablo Picasso as well as where his
friend, Modigliani, painted Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz. Living

Later he developed a more dynamic style, which he applied with telling effect
to bronze compositions. The German occupation
of France during World War II, and the deportation of Jews to
the Nazi death camps, forced Lipchitz to flee France.
With the assistance of the American journalist Varian Fry in Marseille,
he escaped the Nazi regime and went to the United States.

in Washington, D.C.. Brown was one of the first in
America to cast his own bronzes.
In 1847, Brown was elected into the National Academy of Design. Among his
other works are: Abraham Lincoln (Union Square, New York
City); Nathanael Greene, George Clinton, Philip Kearny,
and Richard Stockton (all in the National Statuary Hall, United States Capitol, Washington,

The Impact 


Centrally-located, historic Military Park is quickly becoming recognized as a symbol of Newark’s potential as a thriving destination of historical importance with the added benefit of being a pleasurable green space. One of the most crucial aspects of this renewal is to guarantee that the park’s important works of art immediately receive the care and preservation required so they can be enjoyed by generations to come. Sculpture in public places infuses vitality into city life. They testify to important figures and events that describe crucible moments and ideals in our shared history.

Sources of Funding 
 While we are also doing more traditional fundraising to repair the monuments, we wanted to give the people who live, work, or play in Newark a way to contribute to the ongoing success of the park and participate in an important public art campaign.

<p>We are a group of artists creating a collaborative art space named Broadhope Art Collective.  Broadhope will enable us to exhibit in a shared gallery space, hold classes and workshops, and create artwork in six private studios.  Our space is located in Cheviot, a community with a small-town feel located just seven miles from downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.  </p>
<p>Cheviot was named for the Cheviot Hills located in Southern Scotland by the Scot who settled the area in the late 1800s.  Broadhope is one of those hills, hence our name.  We feel this is a good symbol of what our space will be to this proud, big-hearted community; one important component to a larger whole.  Our intent is to enrich the area with a wide array of visual arts.  We have painters, textile artists, jewelers, potters, mixed media artists, and so much more.  While Cincinnati has a strong reputation for its love of the arts, the West side of town is hungry for more exposure.  The Broadhope Art Collective will fill this need.</p>
<p>The space we've chosen was formerly a salon and spa, and is located on a busy, high visibility intersection in the heart of Cheviot.  It is ready and waiting!  The studios and gallery spots are already claimed by eager artists, ready to share their talents, it simply needs a bit of love before we can open.  All that's left is a little help from you!  We are raising funds to pay for our deposit, gather materials for free-standing gallery walls, and purchase some basic supplies.  We are moving quickly, with the intent of opening at the beginning of October.  In just a few weeks you can see your contribution come to fruition in a vibrant art space open to the community! </p>
<p>Please be sure to check out the photos in the gallery to see examples of what you will receive from the reward levels, as well as take a look at the ""before"" photos of the art space.  With your help we'll have ""after"" photos to show you very soon!</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The <strong>metamorphosis arts project</strong> is a multi-disciplinary arts program geared towards inner city youth. Students use a theme to create art from three different perspectives: visual arts, drama, and dance. Led by Pasha Mckenley, an accomplished actor and arts educator with over twelve years of experience with at risk youth, and Charles Logan a visual art teacher who is gifted at reaching students with emotional and behavioral disabilities. The <strong>metamorphosis art project</strong> is a pilot project that hopes to address the arts education crisis that is affecting most US schools today. It is our goal to to create an ongoing program that supports and suppliments arts education in public schools.</p>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal"">what will the students do?</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In stage one, students will be asked to choose a medium (photography, sculpture, painting, drawing, etc) to create visual art piece to express how they feel about their topic. This artwork will make up the <strong>Visual Gallery</strong> of the project.<span style="""">  </span>In the stage two, the student’s artwork will be used as inspiration for a spoken word, dramatic monologue, or play. This will be a part of the <strong>Audio Gallery</strong>. How does what they did visually sound like?<span style="""">  </span>Stage three will allow the students to explore how there issues feel in their body as a movement or dance piece for the <strong>Flow Gallery</strong>. Once all three pieces are completed, the students will be ready to showcase their work in a public performance. The audience will walk through the artistic process along with the student from beginning to end, able to see clearly how each stage of the students work influenced the previous work of art to create a cohesive body of work from three different perspectives. A workflow always in motion, morphing, constantly as it refers back to its previous work for inspiration, and to its the future work for its continuation.</p>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal"">why are we doing this?</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The goal of the <strong>metamorphosis arts projec</strong>t is to enrich and inspire students, helping them realize the possibilities within the arts whether through performing a dramatic monologue, creating a sculpture, or learning how to choreograph their own dance or movement piece. It is our mission to empower our participants by demonstrating that when time and energy is invested in the arts, young people are able to redirect their lives. The<strong> metamorphosis art project</strong> will provide participants with an artistic forum to deal with issues surrounding ethnicity, socio-economic class, culture, and gender-inequality.</p>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal"">how can you help?</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We’d love for you to sponsor a child so that we can provide this opportunity to as many kids as possible. We are launching <strong>the metamorphosis art project</strong> this summer at a recreation center in Los Angeles and one of the things we need help with is money for art supplies: paint, canvases, brushes, pastels, crayons, paper, clay for sculptures, kilm rental, photography framing and processing, video editing etc. If it makes art, we will need it to serve about 100 kids for the duration of the 8 weeks of this summer camp. (100 x $25 per child in art material fees= $2,500)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To hire additional professional artists to help the students complete their projects. We have the awesome <strong>AMY ""CATFOX"" CAMPION</strong> from the <strong>Antic's Dance Crew</strong> helping the kids with the dance and movement pieces, but we will love to hire two more professional artists to work with the kids develop their work further. We also believe strongly that mentorship is important for both the child and the artist so they can trade experience and expertise in a creative and nurturing environment. (2 artist for 3 hrs per week @ $50 per hr x 8 weeks = $2,400)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We would like to provide each student with <strong>metamorphosis arts project</strong> t-shirts for the duration of the program. ($15 per shirt x 100 students= $1,000)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Once we finish the art project, we would like to have a presentation of all the students work. At this presentation, we will have an art exhibition and of the visual artwork, some live performances of the poem and dances. We will need funds for rental space to host the event, promotion for advertising and marketing for the show, and catering for about 50-100 ppl. ($1,000)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We are making a short film of <strong>the metamorphosis arts project</strong> during the 8 weeks camp and the student presentations the night of the Gala. We’ll need help with the cost of filming, editing and make DVD copies for the children once the film is completed. ($2,000 for filming, editing, and DVD copies for all participants)</p>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal"">how will the metamorphosis art project impact kids?</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">One of the goals of the<strong> metamorphosis art project</strong> is to create a grassroots infrastructure where young people can explore their artistic talents, build leadership and capacity within their community.<span style="""">  </span>Through the use of their new artistic vocabulary, the students will be able to see their community with a fresh perspective.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This will benefit the society at large as the youth will be less likely to engage in dangerous activities. The metamorphosis arts project will also expose these students to a wider variety of artistic disciplines, giving them the opportunity to broaden their ability to research, investigate, create, and diversify their knowledge of the arts. Once the initial phase of metamorphosis art project is complete, the students who have gone through the process will become mentors to new students in the next term. Passing on their knowledge and experiences to younger artist as part of the “<strong>each one teach one”</strong> philosophy.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As professional artists, we are always seeking ways in which to challenge ourselves and more importantly, find amazing opportunities that will allow us to be a positive experience in the communites in which we live. We realize as arts educators that we need more role models for young people wanting to explore their artistic talents. The <strong>metamorphosis arts project</strong> want to become a catalyst that encourages change, transforms lives and develops cultural artistic literacy.</p>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal"">if i donate to your campaign, what's in it for me?</h3>
<p>Aside from donating to a worthy cause and helping some well deserving kids express themselves artistically, here are some perks for you becuase we like you already:</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">Most natural candles are sold in jelly jars, mason jars and plain glasses with no box, or a flimsy cheap flip top box.

<p><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">For some reason it seems that ""natural"" has a prerequisite toward dowdiness or lack of style and lack of attractive packaging.. ""Natural"" seems only for the bare no frills look of a dated simplicity.. until now.. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Century Gothic;"">Virginia Hey Couture natural Soy candles will not only show their inner beauty and qualities, like all other natural candles do.. but they will also break free of the stigma of plain basic packaging, and reveal an extraordinary outer beauty and elegance, that equal and match their inner beauty! </span></p>

My future is a mystery now!However, after the Indiegogo and Paypal fees and conversion charges have all come out of what was raised thanks to your kindness, I will use the funds remaining to purchase a few perfume oils so I can at least pop these beautiful and extremely expensive perfume oils into some handmade soaps and bath salts and make some rollon perfumes and Eau De parfum, all in teenie weenie quantities. Please visit www.virginiahey.com ""Perfumery"" to order.Thank you again for your well wishes and contributions.I will now be fulfilling the incentives, writing the 100 thank you letters and recording the answer machine message for Jaymes and making some product for Richard. Obviously I will not be able to give Richard a luxury Virginia Hey candle, they will be no more now, gone.. so I will substitute the candle with other products.Thank you again, and much lovexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Hello, my name is Virginia Hey, I'm an Australian actress well known across the globe for my roles in Mad Max 2, James Bond Living Daylights, Prisoner Cellblock H and Farscape. www.imdb.me/virginiahey

I've been designing and hand making perfumed products and candles for eleven years now for friends, private customers, for my personal Appearances and Autograph signings.. 

In the last 2 years I designed and developed and trialed the best of my designs to date.. the most exquisite objet d'art signature natural soy candle in extraordinarily beautiful luxurious embroidered satin and porcelain packaging. Eco-Couture candles with a Conscience! 
 Virginia Hey Couture is a stunning example of art meets commerce and heart!

It's time now to leap forward with your help and jump into professional manufacturing, and in doing so, be able to offer the perfect gift that keeps on giving!
                              Virginia Hey Couture 
        The Perfect Gift .. When only the best will do!

Via Indiegogo and with your marvelous help I can outsource manufacturing and have 5,000 candles made for me, and launch my first very own small Virginia Hey Couture store that I will man and operate myself.
             _______________________________________________
I'm sure you're wondering why I don’t fund myself? Unlike USA actors, Australian actors and actresses do not receive residuals, royalties or merchandizing percentages from their acting work within their own country. Funds coming in every time one of my films or TV series appearances re-plays anywhere in the world go straight back to the producers, so, unlike US actors, there has never been any ongoing royalties rushing in to push large projects forward.
           _______________________________________________
Be a friend of my project and let's help this beautiful work of art leap forward! 

My goal is a minimum of $220,000 (including Indiegogo/paypal fees). Brief financial breakdown at the base of this page. 
My Virginia Hey Couture candles will not only create jobs, stimulate the economy, and help farmers, but will also help the environment and lives by being a candle that is eco-friendly, kind, charitable, natural and clean. 
The only by-product is that my candles bring beauty and joy into lives and homes and hearts! 
Those who have loved my handmade creations in the past will tell you that they make everyone smile, they are so gorgeous in every conceivable way.
 

This Indiegogo campaign will enable the most luxurious objet d'art candle line that is based on all things good and beautiful and conscious to leap forward into its very own, very first signature store! 

Most natural candles are sold in jelly jars, mason jars and plain glasses with no box, or a flimsy cheap flip top box. Their inner beauty remains, but their outer appearance almost never reflects the stunning nature of an all natural organic soy wax candle.. 
For some reason it seems that ""natural"" has a prerequisite toward dowdiness or lack of style and lack of attractive packaging.. ""Natural"" seems only for the bare no frills look of a dated simplicity.. until now.. 
Virginia Hey Couture natural Soy candles will not only show their inner beauty and qualities, like all other natural candles do.. but they will also break free of the stigma of plain basic packaging, and reveal an extraordinary outer beauty and elegance, that equal and match their inner beauty! 
My candles delight and ignite all the senses.. They are gorgeous to look at.. sensational to touch.. Heavenly to smell.. simplicity to burn.. and kind to Mother Earth! 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
            
A luxury hand crafted Eco-Couture Soy candle with a conscience.. 

 
Respect:
The utmost respect for life and the life of our planet is in the entire creation of my exquisite candles:  

No animal products or by-products are used, nor is any animal harmed or hurt or tested upon. 
Ecologically kind and intelligent. 
100% organic Kosher soy wax grown on USA farms that use sustainable farming methods.
No Paraffin by-products are used.
No carcinogenics.
Non toxic.
Lead Free Cotton wicks.
Each candle will be individually handmade in the USA or UK using the finest exquisite luxury ingredients.
USA and UK grown ingredients.
Jobs are created to assist and generate a more stable economy balance. 
 We will only use factories that offer special shifts for mothers and single parents.

No middle man, candles will only be available at the Virginia Hey Couture store, via direct marketing, and via the www.VirginiaHey.com website. Direct relationship with manufacturers and suppliers.

 

Virginia Hey Couture offers a unique sensual experience for the connoisseur of finest perfumed candles and fragrances! Exquisite luxury soy candles with all important natural and ecologically intelligent qualities we crave. 
Virginia Hey Couture .. Aromatherapy for mind body soul

8oz net.
6 candle fragrances to begin.
 64-72 hours burn time. 
Each candle contains extravagant exclusive perfumes designed and blended by candle designer/perfumer Virginia Hey.

<p>I,Nadia Buyse, have currently been selected to participate in the HOMEBASE PROJECT residency program in Berlin Germany. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am trying to collect a total of 7000$ to cover my travel , cost of the residency, materials, and some living expenses so that I am able to go participate in this once in a life time opportunity. Regardless if I reach my 7000$ goal or not I will be going to Berlin so every contribution helps so much… I have planned some fabulous Perks for my contributors! Even though going to Berlin is such an exciting opportunity it does not overshadow the exciting opportunity to appreciate the people who make it possible!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Going to Berlin to create this Popera and to participate in this festival will not only be a chance for me to develop professionally, but will also be a chance to create global connections within the art and music world. I have been fortunate enough to work and perform internationally a multitude of times in the past but I feel that the longevity of this program will allow me to develop work in a different way and it will also allow me the time to create strong relationships with my fellow residents and other artists in the Berlin community.</p>
</div>
<p>If you cannot contribute, that is ok! But please spread the word if you can and I thank you so much for your time and consideration.</p>

<p><em>Nadia Buyse is a trans-disciplinary visual artist and musician living in Portland. As a musician, she has been in at least 30 bands she can remember. Nadia has toured the United States and Europe, playing in a range of spaces from music festivals, punk clubs, house shows, and discotheques. She has also exhibited work internationally and nationally, including the MDW Art Fair in Chicago, Beta Spaces in New York, and dOCUMENTA (13). She has recently received an MFA in Visual Studies from Pacific Northwest College of Art and shortly after participated at the ART STAYS residency program in Slovenia, went on a European tour with her multimedia music project DUBAIS, and performed in the Free the Word Tour in the Republic of Georgia.</em></p>

The funds I raise will, of course, go to residency fees-I did get a small grant and I will work at the Center while I attend to offset some more of the amount.  Then there are supplies, because if I attend, I plan on making A LOT of work.  Then I'll be back on here raising funds for a storage unit.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b><i>The Detroit Portrait Series: Writing Our Own History Through Art</i></b></p>
<p>The Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit and the Detroit Broadcasting Company seeks your support for a large-scale painting project that provides an artistic medium for the people of Detroit to tell the history of their city.</p>
<p>Howard Zinn’s book, <i>A People's History of the United States, </i>inspired this public outdoor art project which tells Detroit history from the ""ground up"", honoring leaders and everyday heroes from the city's past and present through large-scale portraiture. Completed panels will be used to board up windows in historic abandoned buildings throughout the city, beginning with the 3-story warehouse on the city's west side.</p>
<p>Painted by Detroit-based mural artist Nicole Macdonald in a bold Fauvist style, portraits will be made on inch-thick recycled wood panels, coated with sealer to withstand the elements, and drilled into window moldings -- framing the portraits and securing the building. This project will serve to invigorate the community by providing thought-provoking art, disseminating local history and eliminating blight.  </p>

<p>People of various ethnicities and occupations will be portrayed in this series: Native Americans significant in Detroit prior to French arrival, European missionaries, African-American civil rights leaders, Hispanic labor organizers and current cultural, social and political activists of all genders and persuasions. Part of the allure of the project is that a number of portraits will be instantly recognizable, like high-profile Detroit social-activist politicians John Conyers and Maryann Mahaffey. These more well-known faces will be positioned beside less well-known individuals currently working for justice in today in the city, such as Yusef Shakur and Rev. James Meyer. This combination of faces will provide discovery and revelation for viewers. The idea is that certain faces will draw attention, like Rosa Parks or Malcolm X, who will lend their fame to the equally important faces of Father Clement Kern and homeless-advocate Mother Waddles. </p>

<p>we are the 2014 Urban Legends Poetry Slam Team. A lovable ragamuffin crew of Ottawa Spoken Word Artists selected via competition to represent the good old 613 at the 2014 Canadian Festival of Spoken Word in Victoria. The main event at the Festival is the Spoken Word Poetry Slam Team Nationals held annually at a different city across Canada. Each of us has put in multiple years of work and dedication to get to this point.</p>
<p>The most important thing for a donor to realize is that for us Poetry isn't a hobby it is a way of life. The opportunity to compete, never mind win a National Championship opens so many poetry related doors which may have otherwise stayed closed. It also gives us an opportunity to represent our city on a Nationwide level, and showcase the diversity of the voices within its arts scene. This campaign, will cover just a fraction of the costs required to fly the Team from Ottawa to Victoria, never mind the price for lodging, food and other expenses.</p>
<p>The cost for plane tickets alone is almost $3000, the price of our stay is close to 2000 and the cost of team merchandise and personal expenses raises the total funds needed to around $6000. Currently we have almost half of that. This campaign is just one small step in what is truly a communal effort. We appreciate any support, no amount too large or small in helping us represent Ottawa, and bringing support and recognition to the city and the vibrant arts community.</p>
<p>In return for your support we are excited to share our art with you via the various perks offered for different levels of support. Once again there is no contribution too small, or too big. We would love to exceed these campaign goals as this is only one step in a larger fundraising process. Every dollar raised will go to help this team reach Victoria and compete to bring the National Championship back to Ottawa.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute we would appreciate any help you could give us by word of mouth, and/or by sharing with your social media circles. Much love to those who took the time to read this and thank you in advance for your generosity. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We met in Armenia while serving in the Peace Corps from 2008 - 2010.   We became good friends and I  managed to convince John to accompany me on a six-month backpacking trip along the famous Appalachian Trail by plying him with baked goods and promises of impending glory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> We are starting our hike in Georgia, at Springer Mt., on April 10th, and will faithfully hike the entire length of the Trail, approximately 2,170 miles, to the Northern terminus, Mt. Katahdin.  Along the way, we will be documenting the experience and our trials and joys through journaling, blogging, sketching, and photography.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We would like to both use the hike to inspire our creative output and use our artistic and creative skills to reflect on our experiences, thoughts, and feelings during the trip.  Having recently returned from living abroad for more than two years, we are still re-adjusting to everything we've learned while living and working in Armenia, as well as getting used to living in American society again.  This is a turning point for us in our lives, and we are looking forward to the challenge of long-distance backpacking and the opportunity for reflection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're excited to share our experience with those who will never get the chance to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail.  Live vicariously through us!<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Hiking the Trail is said to cost about $1.00 - $2.00 a mile, which works out to over $1000 - $2000, per person.  We're hoping to raise money to help us fund this journey : food, other supplies, gear, travel to and from the Trail, showers and laundry in town, and any unexpected expenses, like doctor's visits (but we hope we won't need those!).  Of course, some of the funds we raise will go towards art supplies and working on our reflections after the hike, as well as the perks that all you generous people will be receiving.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For perks, we'll be sharing our reflections and artistic output with you all, in the form of postcards, sketches, photos, paintings, and, in the end, a book, collecting all these things together in a meaningful narrative.  <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you're unable to give money at this time, you can still help us by getting the word out!  Tweet about this or add a link to our project on your Facebook page!  The more the word gets out, the more successful we'll be.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can follow us on our blog at <a href=""http://www.awayfromtheclank.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.awayfromtheclank.blogspot.com</a>, and you're welcome to support our trip in other ways, such as sending us care packages.  Thru-hikers are always hungry!  Information on sending us food can be found on our blog.</p>

On besoin de vous. De vos bidous. De votre change, vos sous noirs, de votre réseau pour soutenir les artistes de la relève montréalaise et pour permettre au OFFTA d’être encore présent, incorruptible….
Lundi 15 avril dernier, nous étions près de 200 personnes réunies à la Buvette chez Simone, à l’occasion de la soirée de lancement où l’on a pu mesurer toute la force vive de la jeune créativité montréalaise mais aussi l’engouement du public et des artistes pour le Festival.
Nous souhaitons vivement que le succès du OFFTA devienne une réussite commune. Partagez cette campagne sur les médias sociaux et parlez- en autour de vous… Soutenons le OFFTA ensemble!!
Pour simplement faire un don au OFFTA et recevoir un reçu de charité (dons de 100$ et plus) veuillez imprimer et remplir le formulaire prévu à cet effet.
C'est AUSSI le temps des impôts et des retours inespérés...alors pourquoi pas ne pas les investir dans un beau projet comme le nôtre ?
 
THE OFFTA NEEDS YOU !
After 5 years of financial support from Heritage Canada, this vital partner has withdrawn its funding. The festival is nearing and this bad piece of news has put us in a state of emergency. 
But, at the OFFTA, we're daring and not afraid to charge forward, so we've maintained the entire program which the artists of our community counts on to present their work!
We need you. Your small change, your pennies, your network to support montreal emerging artists and to ensure that the OFFTA will carry on, incorruptible...

<h3>Our Shared Story</h3>
<p>The fishing tradition has touched everyone’s lives in Provincetown in some way, from the men and women of Provincetown's fishing past to the ""wash ashore"" today. We all realize that the town we know and love, would not be the place it is, were it not for the generations of fishermen and the safe harbor they created here, not just for themselves, but for one of the most remarkable and diverse communities in America. The time is more than past due that this proud history be honored with a public monument that echoes all the individualism and spirit of Provincetown's fishing legacy.</p>
<p>Provincetown native, and career sculptor, Romolo Del Deo, has been selected by the Provincetown Fishermen's Memorial Committee to create a fitting tribute in monumental lost wax bronze, a medium he has mastered for over 30 years, with publics works world wide. HIs scale model has been unanimously approved with acclamation by all the governing boards of Provincetown: the Art Commission, the Pier Corporation and the Board of Selectmen. The model will be unveiled in a public reception on June 28th, 7PM at Berta Walker Gallery, as part of the Blessing of the Fleet Celebration. ( See attached info)</p>
<p>The Provincetown Fishermen's Memorial Committee is asking for your tax deductible donation (through our fiscal sponsor, The Provincetown Community Compact, a 501(c)(3) organization incubating creative non-profit projects) to help fund the first phase of the work to create a Provincetown Fishermen's Memorial in monumental bronze, to be sited on Macmillan Wharf in Provincetown, MA. Gifts of any amount are appreciated, no amount is insignificant, everything helps. Please give generously in whatever amount you can afford, to help the Fishermen’s Memorial Committee rise to this challenge of creating something lasting that speaks not just to our storied past but to our future.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Goals and Your Rewards</h3>
<ul>
<li>This first phase of the funding campaign is designed to underwrite the startup costs of engineering and structural enlargement, in preparation for sculpting the monument in full scale and fabricating its armature. </li>
<li>This project is targeted to take at least two years, and will require funding at various stages. All monies donated will be administered by the Fishermen's Memorial Committee and any unspent funds will be retained in the nonprofit's account and applied to the next phase of the project.</li>
<li>Donors will be rewarded with a beautiful selection of recognition gifts, according to the level of their giving, including limited edition original graphics, bronzes editions by Romolo Del Deo. The limited edition items will be available throughout all phases of the project until the editions are complete. No additional copies will be allowed and every copy will be an authentic signed artwork by the artist.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is long overdue, Provincetown's sister towns of Gloucester and New Bedford, both have famous monuments honoring their seamen, how ironic that Provincetown, America's first art colony, and the home to artists for generations, has until now, lacked a monument to outshine her rivals.</p>
<p>The artist we have chosen, Romolo Del Deo,(exhibition resume attached) not only knows and loves the town of Provincetown where he was raised and is the son of a fisherman (his father, the renown painter Salvatore Del Deo, fished with Manny Zora on the Sea Fox) but he is also an accomplished professional in his field, with numerous monumental public works and museum exhibits. Recently, he was the youngest sculptor featured in the national touring exhibit, ""Tides of Provincetown"". This historic survey exhibit presented the 80 most important area artists of the last 200 years, organized by the New Britain Museum of American Art.</p>
<p>The Fishermen's Memorial Committee is comprised of Provincetown residents who know and love the town. They are dedicated to this cause:</p>
<p><br/>Carol Peters - Chairperson</p>
<p>Kerry Adams - Treasurer</p>
<p> <span>Peter Robert Cook</span> - Secretary</p>

These voices - your voices - will then become the accompaniment for the live performance of 'Bending the Arc,' by Jeryl Bright, featuring 'RDK' and the Georgia Tech Chorale and Chamber Choir.  Every voice will count at midnight for the finale as we sing to bend the arc.

The live recording of 'Bending the Arc,' an original song by Jeryl Bright. This record will include the voices of our Flux Night 2015 audience and will continue across the airwaves and into the future. 


In return we will share with you items that commemorate Flux Night 2015: Dream. Depending on how much you give, you will get:
 A shout out on our website.
Your name on the limited edition record jacket.
The cool Flux Night 2015: Dream magnet.
The coolest Flux Night 2015: Dream T-shirt.
Limited edition postcard of the artist's concept rendering, with a special thank you signed by Jennifer Wen Ma.
Limited edition 12"" vinyl recording of the original song 'Bending the Arc,' by Jeryl Bright featuring 'RDK' | A-side, the studio recording | B-side, the live recording - your voice could be in the chorus!
A ticket to the VIP Party on Flux Night.
You and a friend will join Jennifer Wen Ma for a cocktail and a chat about art and life at the Flux Night VIP Party.    The Impact  
Bending the Arc brings a world-class public art project to the city of Atlanta - to be experienced on the streets of the historic Old Fourth Ward, free and open to everyone who shows up.
This project will bring us together out in the world, shoulder to shoulder, face to face to experience through a work of art how we can all make a difference.
In the spirit of Bending the Arc where every voice counts, the software being created for this project will become open-source, further creating an ongoing global community of people using voices to effect change.

<p><span>Please help me rebuild my ceramic wood kiln.  </span></p>
<p>My name is Quercy Golsse and I am a Canadian/French ceramic wood fire artist based in the south west of France in the historic medieval village of Puycelsi.  I moved back here to re-invest my great grandfather’s farming terraces abandoned since the 1940’s and create a working life for myself. </p>
<p>My practice revolves around the use of a wood fired kiln and natural glazing. This requires a specific type of kiln, like the one I built back in 2009, a small 3 cubic m cross draft kiln suitable for one person's work. At the time, I was only able to get used refractory bricks of questionable quality, which did allow me to get started. However, after seven years of great firings, those poor quality bricks are crumbling apart and the arch is falling in. As such, I can no longer make and fire work, putting my artistic practice in jeopardy.</p>

But it’s not only that, it is also for me a way of participating in a long active family presence in this village going back at least five generations . A small rural village of about 80 people in winter, it is hard for younger people to stay and live in this village as potential work is limited to seasonal work during the tourist season and rare during the rest of the year. The village is a classified historic site which means all renovations must go through extensive paperwork and meet an aesthetic standard making any work expensive. It took me several years to get permission to build my kiln shed and happily built it in the required post and beam style with antique tiles for the roof.  My presence and implication in the village is my small attempt to prevent the village from become Disneyland type tourist trap, inactive and lifeless for most of the year. This village needs all sorts to live in it, both young and old, permanent and secondary, working and retired but the most important thing is that it needs to keep on living.</p><br/><p>With your help, I hope to keep participating in the life of this village and to keep making and sharing my art.</p><div>

Please help me rebuild my ceramic wood kiln.  
My name is Quercy Golsse and I am a Canadian/French ceramic wood fire artist based in the south west of France in the historic medieval village of Puycelsi.  I moved back here to re-invest my great grandfather’s farming terraces abandoned since the 1940’s and create a working life for myself. 
My practice revolves around the use of a wood fired kiln and natural glazing. This requires a specific type of kiln, like the one I built back in 2009, a small 3 cubic m cross draft kiln suitable for one person's work. At the time, I was only able to get used refractory bricks of questionable quality, which did allow me to get started. However, after seven years of great firings, those poor quality bricks are crumbling apart and the arch is falling in. As such, I can no longer make and fire work, putting my artistic practice in jeopardy.
      As the whole kiln is falling apart, I don't dare fire again as the inside of the kiln gets to above 1300 degrees Centigrade, and sudden collapse at this temperature would be catastrophic to both the people firing the kiln and the local environment.I need to rebuild my kiln using better quality bricks but at minimum 2 Euros a brick for about 1500 bricks, this falls outside my potential budget, especially as I have no tool with which to fire new work. Taking advantage of this unfortunate situation, I plan to make a new slightly smaller and refined design kiln that is more efficient and that will hopefully last for the next twenty years, if not more. 



What I NeedBuilding a wood fired kiln is a very expensive undertaking, even a small one like this one at about 2 cubic metres will cost about 4000 Euros for just the basics i.e. new refractory bricks and delivery (each brick weighs about 3.2kg) . The overall project will cost 5000 to 6000 Euros including new kiln shelves (needed to load pieces on for optimized space usage) and accessory materials (metal for bracing, wood for formwork, mortar). I will be building the kiln myself with the help of friends and volunteers and using whatever elements that I can salvage from my first kiln as materials to increase insulation and structure.  In exchange for helping me, I'm offering specially made cups and natural ash bowls, workshops to learn how to fire a wood kiln and art works by well generous contributing artists and friends.  This kiln is, as I've mentioned, a critical part of my own artistic practice, without it I cannot continue to make the work in the specific world of wood fired ceramics that I have been developing and refining for the past 12 years. But it’s not only that, it is also for me a way of participating in a long active family presence in this village going back at least five generations . A small rural village of about 80 people in winter, it is hard for younger people to stay and live in this village as potential work is limited to seasonal work during the tourist season and rare during the rest of the year. The village is a classified historic site which means all renovations must go through extensive paperwork and meet an aesthetic standard making any work expensive. It took me several years to get permission to build my kiln shed and happily built it in the required post and beam style with antique tiles for the roof.  My presence and implication in the village is my small attempt to prevent the village from become Disneyland type tourist trap, inactive and lifeless for most of the year. This village needs all sorts to live in it, both young and old, permanent and secondary, working and retired but the most important thing is that it needs to keep on living.With your help, I hope to keep participating in the life of this village and to keep making and sharing my art.




Please help if you can or help me get the word out about this project. Please share this page on your social media channels and let’s get this kiln rebuilt and firing strong for many years to come. My goal:To raise 4000 Euros for the very basics needed to build the kiln.Stretch goal :After raising the basic 4000 Euros to get the basic building materials, any additional funds raised up to 6000 Euros will go to getting new kiln shelves (about 900 Euros for a full set) new refractory pillars, metal for bracing and new kiln tools (used during the firings) and other building material wood for the arch forms.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I'm passionate about many things- Art, dance, Music, Acting-  Although something  draws me to the art of Pin up- but not just any pin up- the styles from WWII. Although Pin up art has been around for a much longer time, this style, I think, is the most popular from history and most people think of this kind when the word ""pin up"" is mentioned. I have been involved in recreating the world and lives of people during WWII- as a performer and artist. Pin up modeling has become a passion of mine and something I want to share more with the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By creating this calendar- yes one will have the opportunity to look at pretty girls (and I don't think anyone is complaining on that), but in doing so, we are also creating a part of history that I think can get overlooked sometimes. This project also allows not only models and a photographer to come together, but artists from all backgrounds. Hair artists, Make-up artist, even film makers, singers and actors will be involved. Isn't our job as artists to strive and make something beautiful? It's even more productive when we can combine more fields of creation in the process. By creating these calendars, the sale of each one will have a percentage of the funds donated to the Alzheimers Association. This is something that personally affects me as I have a grandmother currently suffering from it and a deceased grandmother who had dementia. So many WWII vets are now at the age also where these terrible diseases are inflicting on their lives more and more. We will also be giving a percentage to Wounded Warriors for those vets who have served courageously and endured injury. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $5000- yes I know this does sound like a lot for just some pictures- but these are NOT just some pictures. We are seeking out the perfect places and that cost time and money. Printing up the final calendars cost money. Paying professional models and a photographer cost money. There are more than enough places for our money to go for this project. Other funding includes costumes, set ups, break downs, and on set food and drink ( as we don't want our models to get cranky and to stay hydrated and look gorgeous). Please check out the perks to see what you can take home for being a part of this amazing project. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>How can you help? Spreading the word and this link will be our best attribute to our goal. Simply by asking people to donate any amount (and trust me, ANY amount helps)  they can afford will help get us closer. Please note, this project is not done in vanity and we are not wanting to just look at ourselves. As I stated before, we are wanting to create an image of history and having our proceeds go to a greater cause is the biggest goal here. Thank you for taking the time to check out this project.

I am a full-time artist. As such, 90% of my revenue goes right back into buying supplies and making more art. The tightly calculated goal for my Artist Residency in Mayurbhanj is $3200.

As a tax payer, you automatically contribute to the grant system but these grants are very difficult to get. If you like my art and you like what I do, this is the best way to show it!
If you happen to read all of these perks but are not in a position to participate, you can still show your support by sharing this campaign. 

Whatever your contribution is, I thank you from the bottom of my paint-stained heart! Merci!

   Ein bisschen Hintergrund... Es ist inzwischen 7 Jahre her als ich auf die Schnapsidee kam eine spezielleBerliner Jeans hier produzieren zu lassen.Die Grundidee kam von meinem Faible für den blauen Stoff, mit dem ich mich besonders durch meinen Laden Rock-A-Tiki seit fast 20 Jahren intensiv beschäftige und natürlich die Stadt aller Städte. Und wie Berlin sollte auch die Jeans sein:rauh, dickhäutig, abseits aller Mainstream-Modeströmungen und quasi unkaputtbar. Nach langer Suche fand ich eine kleine Näherei im Wedding welche das Know-How und das Equipment für die Produktion hatte.Die erste Edition von 50 Stück war innerhalb von 4 Wochen verkauft.Selbst ich als Optimist war überrascht stellte ich mir doch insgeheim die Frage ""Wieviel Jeans-Label braucht die Welt noch?"".  Der eigentliche Star: die Nietenhose!
 Wie bei einem guten Essen sind bei einer Jeans die Zutaten die wichtigste Grundlage.

DENIM:  16oz Indigo Dyed Sanforized Selvage Denim von Cone Mills U.S.A. 
Klingt jetzt für viele erstmal kryptisch, nur soviel dazu: Cone Mills war seit 1915 der Denim Produzent für die Levi´s 501, 16oz ist die Dicke des Stoffes (sprich sehr dick, ""normale"" Jeans liegen bei 8-10oz) und Sanforizing ein Verfahren zum schrumpfen des Stoffes, sprich die Jeans läuft nicht mehr groß ein.Wer mehr wissen will schaut einfach mal bei den Perks nach. Dort biete ich eine Einführung in die wundersame Welt der Nietenhosen an. TASCHENSTOFF, NAHTGARN & LABEL: natürlich Made in Germany!NIETEN & KNÖPFE: ganz oldschool aus Kupfer Made in U.S.A.
Und was unterscheidet Berlin Denim nun von anderen Jeans?Im Gegensatz zu den gerade modernen engen Beinkleidern hat unsere Jeans ein gerades etwas weiteres Bein. Dazu werden die Berlin Denim in 2 Längen angeboten 34inches und 38inches. Letztere ermöglicht es auch großen Menschen die Jeans mit Umschlag zu tragen.Ein weiterer  mir wichtiger Punkt war die sogenannte Watchpocket.Das ist die kleine Tasche vorne welche man bei jeder Jeans findet. Vor über 100 Jahren dazu gedacht die Taschenuhr (oder später das Kleingeld) unterzubringen.Das fand ich 2008 nicht mehr zeitgemäß und habe diese vergrößert, so das man auch bequem einen MP3-Player (oder Taschenmesser, Feuerzeuge etc.) darin unterbringen kann. Auch die hinteren Taschen bieten genug Stauraum, was gerade im Sommer, wenn man nicht mehr als Jeans & T-Shirt tragen will, sehr praktisch ist.Bei der Farbwahl der Garne hab ich mich gegen das gängige Orange für die Farben Berlins entschieden: Rot & Weiß.




Ein ebenso wichtiger Punkt ist, das die Berlin Denim einzig und allein nur bei Rock-A-Tiki erhältlich ist. Der Grund ist mehr als simpel. Wir produzieren mit den besten Materialien und in sehr kleiner Stückzahl, d.h. die Produktionskosten sind sehr hoch. Nur dadurch, das zwischen Endkunde und Produzent kein Großhändler/Wiederverkäufer steht, können wir trotz gestiegener Weltmarktpreise für Baumwolle den Preis von 139,- Euro seit 2008 halten. Auch wenn wir Einschnitte machen mussten: bis zur 4.

Dieses fiel aus Kostengründen leider, leider weg.Unter den Perks ist dieses T-Shirt als Re-Issue erhältlich. 
Die Frage aller Fragen: warum Crowdfunding?
 Bislang konnte ich die vorherigen Editionen mit Hilfe von Freunden und Familie vorfinanzieren . Bei der letzten Edition wurde ein guter Teil der Produktion mit dieser Aktie gedeckt:
Inzwischen ist Crowdfunding ein großes Thema und man kann ein vielfaches mehr an Unterstützern erreichen als über eine Aktie welche man nur im Laden anbietet.Und (Achtung! Wortspiel!) wo wäre eine Indigo-gefärbte Buxe besser aufgehoben als bei Indiegogo?

An exhibition of creative projects will be showcased with pop up events and exhibitions happening around each city with our festival partners.Current festival partners include: Amrita Performing Arts, Apexart, ChildSafe International, Epic Arts, Institut Francais, Meta House, UNESCO, UN Habitat, and more to be announced with the final program!(Kaley, the giant crocodile, Pich Sopheap, 2012) (Water, curse or blessing?!, AEDES, 2012) YOUTH PARTICIPATIONOur City Festival is invested in youth and their participation in city-making.  In 2012, the festival launched the Youth Ambassadors Program offering opportunities to Cambodian students to get involved with projects, the festival and workshops that expand their experiences of the city and the impacts of the decisions they make on a daily basis.  We have a strong focus on accessibility and reach out to young populations to attend and participate in the festival.  Support youth and build the future!(Youth Ambassadors and Princess Soma Norodom, 2012) YOUR SUPPORT: 20 PROJECTS, 20 DAYSWe need $8000 more to fund all the festival projects and have only 20 days to raise it! With $8000 we can support 20 projects in the festival.We believe that everyone’s contribution will help make Our City Festival a truly accessible and dynamic festival of art, architecture and ideas. Financial support is very important and necessary. While the festival is founded on community and volunteer participation, there are also hard costs involved. Financial contributions will help cover the costs associated with art production, events and a small team across Phnom Penh, Battambang and Siem Reap.Help us to make this happen!

On one hand it generates the unstable scenario of our days – familiar till boredom, foreign to fear – and on the other it negotiates our position in it. We reproduce, clone, and copy. While aiming for originality, freshness and singularity, we sample, quote and remix in the attempt to reinvent ourselves, to renovate our products, forge anew our styles.</p><p>Second Chances researches the true meaning of the act of remaking: is copying just the most efficient to produce and spread innovation; does history repeats itself? Is every redesign, revival, translation and adaptationactually  something completely new and unique?</p><p>A rich array of gifted and established minds, accompanied by up-and-coming talents, look into the mutations of religions (Domingo Milella, Osamu Tetzuka) and the falsification of the arts (Alicja Kwade, Beate Gutshow);  the re-planning of our cities (Raumlabor and raumtaktik) and the revolution of our societies (Saskia Sassen, Bifo, Nina Power), the reinvention of tradition (Antonio Marras);  modding and  tuning,  customizations (Massimo Baldwin, Rashad Becker);  covering and the remixing (Joachim Schmidt, Katja Stuke&amp;Oliver Sieber),  duplicating (Bruce Conner), and piracy (Piracy Project).</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Table of Contents:</b><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy""

Dwelling’.</p><p>Printed in a limited edition of 1000 copies, it may be found at the intersection of new trends in independent publishing: slow journalism and striking images in a generous layout, a sumptuous fanzine produced with love, edited with the right balance of ingenuity and naïveté.<br/><br/></p><h3>What is The Lazlo Reader? </h3><p>After getting more people involved in the editorial process we gave the publication a new format and a new name that better meets the rich amount of material collected and our drive to go deeper, wider and bolder while staying independent, advertising-free, self-published: sharp as a magazine and thorough as a book, it is The Lazlo Reader.</p><p>Someone would call it a bookazine. We like to think of it as a place of investigation through expression, a platform for diverse minds based in different fields, who are prepared to share their art, research and passion with an equally heterogeneous audience: a hub for debate and creativity.</p><p>Each volume  will collect interviews, overviews and reviews, pictures and illustrations, works of fiction and non-fiction enquiring into a chosen topic and its implications for sciences and politics, crafts and theories, arts and fashions.<br/>Equal attention will be paid to the quality of the content and its layout. We will chase daring ideas and bring them to you in an adventurous design.<br/></p><p>After months of work and rework, design and delays, copious texts, pictures and illustrations have been collected, proofed and are ready for print. We strove to make The Lazlo Reader bold and beautiful, wide and deep, clean and sharp. We believe we really made it. Now we want our Reader to reach the bookshelf, then your house and see if you feel the same about it. But to that we need you help.</p><p><br/></p><h3>How does crowd-funding on Indiegogo works?</h3><p>Until recently, financing a business, project or venture involved asking a few people or a bank for large sums of money. Crowd-funding is turning this idea on its head, using the internet to help entrepreneurs talk to hundreds of potential funders that each contribute a smaller yet decisive amount, receiving some kind of reward in return. This works by placing a campaign on a web platform, in our case Indiegogo.</p><p>With Indiegogo a project creator pitches an idea, sets a funding goal and a length of time to reach it (deadline). If people like the project, they can pledge (donate) money to make it happen. Creators also honour the pledges with rewards (perks), giving the contributors an additional incentive to support the campaign. <br/></p><p>We have chosen to set up our campaign as a Fixed Funding, an all-or-nothing funding model where projects must be fully funded or no money (and no rewards) changes hands: backers of our project pledge a certain amount of money, but we only get that money (and they get the rewards) if the total amount of pledges reaches or exceeds our funding goal. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when the time expires and soon they will receive their rewards. If the goal isn’t met by the specified time then no one’s credit card is charged, no reward is sent and the project doesn’t get any of the pledged funds.</p><p>Donating is easy: in the page you can decide how much contribute, what perk you want and then you will be lead to the PayPal page to execute the payment. You DON'T need to have a PayPal account to contribute, you can also pay with a valid credit card.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Why are we here and where will the money go?</h3>
<p>Launching a printed journal is an expensive
(ad)venture.</p>
<p>Lazlo Magazine n°0
was advertising-free and totally self-financed. As a self-published
publication, we want to keep our freedom and creativity, as well as a
top-quality printing and design. That's why we need your help.</p>
<p>The money we raise through this campaign will fund
the printing costs and some production expenses plus the tolls and
fees generated by the campaign itself. Here’s a breakdown of our
estimates.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Printing</i>. <i>Roughly €7.000</i>.
	The magazine will be printed on a high quality, FSC certified, very
	white, very expensive, 120gsm uncoated paper. The printing, cutting
	and binding of The Lazlo Reader n°1 will be executed by a European
	top-notch printing house.</p>

<p><i>Translations and proofreading, image post-production and proofing</i>. Many contributions in the magazine were
	original written in German, French, Italian or Japanese and need to
	be faithfully translated to English. Before heading to print the
	numerous images are accurately post-produced by professionals.

</li></ul><p>Our ideal goal is not only to cover the costs of
Issue n°1, but to raise enough money to independently distribute it
ourselves and plant the seed for future issues. If we're able to
raise money beyond €10,000, we will put that towards shipping the
magazine to magazine shops, bookstores and museums around the world –
avoiding the middleman and keeping the price as low as possible –
and planning the production of more original content for the next
issues.

In questo volume investighiamo come negli ultimi decenni questa pratica contraddittoria sia diventata parte dominante delle nostre strategie quotidiane.</p><p>Il remaking è un'azione dalla doppia natura che da un lato contribuisce a generare lo scenario incerto dei nostri giorni e dall'altro è il modo di negoziare la nostra posizione al suo interno: riproduciamo, copiamo e cloniamo mentre cerchiamo di essere originali, nuovi e unici; campioniamo, citiamo e remixiamo nel tentativo di reinvetarci, di rinnovare i nostri prodotti, disegnare nuovi stili.<br/>Second Chances cercherà di capire se copiare non sia solo il modo più efficiente per produrre e diffondere innovazione; se la storia ripeta se stessa; se ogni redesign e revival, traduzione o adattamento non sia in realtà qualcosa di completamente nuovo e unico.</p><p>Una ricca varietà di autori – circa 60, tra menti affermate e futuri talenti – condivide la propria ricerca sulle mutazioni delle religioni (Domingo Milella, Osamu Tetzuka) e la falsificazione dell'arte (Alicja Kwade, Beate Gutshow), la ri-pianificazione delle nostre città (Raumlabor and raumtaktik) e la rivoluzione delle nostre società (Saskia Sassen, Bifo, Nina Power); la re-invenzione della trazione (Antonio Marras) e il modificare, ritoccare e personalizzare (Massimo Baldwin, Rashad Becker); la cover ed il remix (Joachim Schmidt, Katja Stuke&amp;Oliver Sieber), la copia (Bruce Conner) e la pirateria (Piracy Project).<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/712498/files/20140712064614-CONTENENDO-MENO_RIDOTTO_Page_1.jpg?1405172774"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/712502/files/20140712064754-CONTENENDO-MENO_RIDOTTO_Page_2.jpg?1405172874"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/712503/files/20140712064803-CONTENENDO-MENO_RIDOTTO_Page_3.jpg?1405172883"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/712504/files/20140712064811-CONTENENDO-MENO_RIDOTTO_Page_4.jpg?1405172891"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/727086/files/20140718100457-COntents3-9ok.jpg?1405703097"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/712505/files/20140712064827-CONTENENDO-MENO_RIDOTTO_Page_5.jpg?1405172907"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/712506/files/20140712064838-CONTENENDO-MENO_RIDOTTO_Page_6.jpg?1405172918"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/712507/files/20140712064847-CONTENENDO-MENO_RIDOTTO_Page_7.jpg?1405172927"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/712508/files/20140712064856-CONTENENDO-MENO_RIDOTTO_Page_8.jpg?1405172936"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h3>Chi siamo?</h3><p>Un direttore responsabile di base a Berlino, un piccolo un piccolo team internazionale di collaboratori editoriali e un ampio gruppo di autori sparsi per il mondo.<br/>Fotografi e illustratori, critici e scrittori, stilisti e accademici squadernano concetti e immagini, sfidano estetiche e visioni del mondo.<br/>Appassionati e professionisti, nuove facce e voci conosciute, talenti emergenti e maestri affermati collaborano e  dibattono.<br/>Interessi diversi e diversi backgrounds;

Per noi è un luogo per il dibattito e la creatività, una piattaforma per menti diverse provenienti da campi diversi, pronte a condividere la propria arte, passione e ricerca con un pubblico ugualmente eterogeneo.</p><p>In ogni volume interviste, articoli e recensioni, fotografie e illustrazioni, saggi e racconti affrontano un argomento e ne indagano le implicazioni per le scienze e la politica, le arti e la moda, la teoria e le prassi.</p><p>La stessa cura verrà dedicata alla qualità dei contenuti e alla sua impaginazione. Andremo alla ricerca delle idee più coraggiose e vele porteremo in un design rigoroso e moderno.</p><p><br/><b>Autori</b>:<br/>Copertina: <a href=""http://www.alicjakwade.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alicja Kwade</a></p><p>  Immagini (illustrazioni, collages, fotografie e embroideries on fabric):  <a href=""http://www.janbrockhaus.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jan Brockhaus</a>, <a href=""http://thebambamcollective.blogspot.de/search/label/Pia%20Z%C3%B6lzer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pia Zölzer</a>,  <a href=""http://cargocollective.com/billnoir"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bill Noir</a>, <a href=""http://www.basik.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lucio ‘Basik’ Bolognesi</a>, <a href=""http://www.planetatangerina.com/en/studio/team/madalena-matoso"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Madalena Matoso</a>, <a href=""http://www.erugiery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ruggero Asnago</a>, <a href=""http://www.beateguetschow.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beate Gütschow</a>, <a href=""http://www.contrastiurbani.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Antonio di Cecco</a>, <a href=""www.massimomastrorillo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Massimo Mastrolillo</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ3Yr58P1UM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">René Clément and Henri Decaë</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylc5ToQoLg0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Minghella and John Seale</a>, <a href=""http://www.luzphoto.com/author.php?authorCode=delbrenna"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Giovanni Del Brenna</a>, <a href=""http://www.giorgiodinoto.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Giorgio Di Noto</a>, <a href=""http://www.broombergchanarin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Broomberg &amp;

Pensiamo di esserci riusciti. Ora vogliamo che il nostro Reader raggiunga le librerie e le vostre case e sapere se anche voi la pensate così. Ma perché questo succeda abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Come funziona il crowfunding su Indiegogo.</h3><p>Il creatore di un progetto presenta un’idea, stabilisce un capitale come obiettivo (goal) che intende raggiungere con la campagna － necessario per il finanziamento del progetto － e una data (deadline) entro la quale quell’obiettivo deve essere raggiunto. <br/></p><p>Se il pubblico apprezza il progetto, può donare denaro per renderne possibile la realizzazione. I creatori inoltre premiano le donazioni con una ricompensa che rappresenta un ulteriore incentivo al sostegno del progetto. Se allo scadere della data stabilita viene raggiunto l'obiettivo, automaticamente il pagamento viene addebitato sulla carta di credito dei donatori e qualche tempo dopo questi riceveranno le ricompense; se invece l'obiettivo non viene raggiunto entro il tempo specificato, il pagamento non viene addebitato e nessuna ricompensa verrà corrisposta.</p><p>Donare è facile: in questa pagina puoi scegliere quanto donare, quale ricompensa vuoi e poi verrai rediretto alla pagina di Indiegogo per eseguire il pagamento. Non hai bisogno di PayPal per contribuire, è sufficiente una carta di credito valida.<br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>Perché siamo qui e dove andranno i vostri soldi.</h3><p>Pubblicare un volume stampato è un impresa molto costosa.</p><p>Come rivista autoprodotta vogliamo mantenere la nostra libertà e creatività editoriale, senza compromettere la qualità di design e strampa. Ecco perché siamo qui a chiedere il vostro aiuto.</p><p>I soldi che raccoglieremo attraverso questa campagna copriranno i costi di stampa, alcune spese di produzione più le spese fisse dovute alla campagna stessa. Ecco una stima delle spese:<br/><br/><b><i></i></b><i>Stampa.</i><b><i> €7.000 circa</i></b>. La rivista sarà stampata su carta usomano di alta qualità da 120gsm, certificata FSC, ultrabianca e particolarmente cara. La stampa e la rilegatura di The Lazlo Reader n°1verrà eseguita da una stamperia europea di prim'ordine.</p><p><i>Traduzione e proofreading, post produzione e proofing delle immagini,</i> <b>€1,000</b> Molti dei testi contenuti nel volume sono stati originariamente scritti in tedesco, italiano, francese o giapponese e abbiamo quindi dovuto tradurli fedelmente in inglese. Le molte immagini prima di andare in stampa devono essere corrette e controllate da professionisti.</p><p><i> Produzione e spedizione delle ricompense per la campagna, </i><b>€1.000</b></p><p> <i>Percentuali da pagare a Indiegogo. Indiegogo 5% + PayPal 5%</i>. <b>€1000</b><br/>   <br/>Il nostro obbiettivo ideale è non solo di coprire i costi di The Lazlo Reader n°1, ma di raccogliere abbastanza denaro da poter distribuire il volume indipendentemente e piantare i semi di futuri uscite. Se saremmo capaci di andare oltre i €10.000, destineremo i fondi in eccesso alla spedizione della nostra rivista alle librerie e negozi specializzati e ai musei intorno al mondo – evitando intermediari e tenendo così il prezzo il più basso possibile – e organizzare la produzione di ulteriori contenuti originali per le prossime uscite.<br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>Altri modi di aiutare.</h3><p>Se ti piace il nostro progetto ma non puoi donare, non preoccuparti, ci sono altri modi in cui ci puoi dare una mano. Facci sapere cosa pensi della nostra pagina su Indiegogo e di come stiamo portando avanti la campagna, suggeriscici nuove strategie comunicative o magari qualche genere di ricompensa che dovremmo aggiungere. Ma, cosa ancora più importante, contribuisci al passaparola: passa i link della campagna ai tuoi amici, conoscenti e colleghi sui social network o attraverso la mail, parla di noi sotto l'ombrellone, al bar o al parco. Seguici e partecipa su Facebook.

Remaking  is defined in dictionaries as “‘to make anew’ meaning both ‘making once more, again’ and ‘making in a new and different way, form, or manner’.” In this volume we investigate how in the last decades this contradictory practice became a dominant part of our everyday cultural dynamics. Remaking is a double-natured act. On one hand it generates the unstable scenario of our days – familiar till boredom, foreign to fear – and on the other it negotiates our position in it. We reproduce, clone, and copy. While aiming for originality, freshness and singularity, we sample, quote and remix in the attempt to reinvent ourselves, to renovate our products, forge anew our styles.Second Chances researches the true meaning of the act of remaking: is copying just the most efficient to produce and spread innovation; does history repeats itself? Is every redesign, revival, translation and adaptationactually  something completely new and unique?A rich array of gifted and established minds, accompanied by up-and-coming talents, look into the mutations of religions (Domingo Milella, Osamu Tetzuka) and the falsification of the arts (Alicja Kwade, Beate Gutshow);  the re-planning of our cities (Raumlabor and raumtaktik) and the revolution of our societies (Saskia Sassen, Bifo, Nina Power), the reinvention of tradition (Antonio Marras);  modding and  tuning,  customizations (Massimo Baldwin, Rashad Becker);  covering and the remixing (Joachim Schmidt, Katja Stuke&Oliver Sieber),  duplicating (Bruce Conner), and piracy (Piracy Project).Table of Contents:Who are we?A Berlin-based editor in chief, a small international editorial team and an array of contributors allfrom every corner of the globe.Photographers and illustrators, film critics and writers, fashion designers and academic professors delving into concepts and images, challenging paradigms and aesthetics.Amateurs and pros, new faces and known voices, up-and-coming talents and well affirmed maestros collaborate and confront, debate and conspire. Different targets, different backgrounds; diverse styles, same goal: take the readers on a visual, intellectual and mental journey.Editorial Office:Editor in chief: Lazlo MoultonPhoto Editor: 3/3Editors at large: Chiara Capodici, Andrea Grippo, Mary CelestePromotion&Distribution: SHS PublishingPolitical Editor: Victor Secretan  (Multitude)Illustration Editor: Serena RotaFashion Editor: Maria Grazia LintasContributors:Cover by Alicja KwadeImages (illustrations, collages, pictures and embroideries on fabric) by: Jan Brockhaus, Pia Zölzer,  Bill Noir, Lucio ‘Basik’ Bolognesi, Madalena Matoso, Ruggero Asnago, Beate Gütschow, Antonio di Cecco, Massimo Mastrolillo, René Clément and Henri Decaë, Anthony Minghella and John Seale, Giovanni Del Brenna, Giorgio Di Noto, Broomberg & Chanarin, Andras Calamandrei, Giuliano Matteucci, Domingo Milella, Bruce Conner, Daniela Comani, Doug Rickard, John GossageComic by Osamu TezukaRemixes by: Oliver Sieber & Katja Stuke, Joachim SchmidCrosswords by Emilio Pianotexts (articles, reviews and interviews by and with)Chiara Capodici, Jens Hoffmann and Chelsea Haines (The Exhibitonist), Pro Qm Berlin, Rashad Becker, Arno Raffeiner, Andrea Grippo, Marco Lecis, raumtaktik, Franco Stella, Martino Sacchi, Raumlabor, Jakob Tigges, Marco Morante, Aristotelis Vasilakos (Assetto Corsa - Power and Glory), Leo Goldsmith, Massimo Baldwin, Lazlo Moulton, Hailey LaVoy, Tony McKibbin, Gal Kirn, Anne Querrien, Victor Secretan, Lucia Sagradini, John Holloway, José Chatroussat, Sleh Dine Kchouk, Saskia Sassen, Federico Campagna, Nina Power, Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi, Lynn Harris and Eva Weinmayr (The Piracy Project), Amedeo Martegani and Giulia di Lenarda (A+M Bookstore), Antonio Marras, Maria Grazia Lintas, Bastian Tebarth, Sebastian Arthur Hau, Daniel Kasman, Mary CelesteHow did it all start and how did we get here?March 2011 marked the release Lazlo Magazine n°0 – ‘On Dwelling’.Printed in a limited edition of 1000 copies, it may be found at the intersection of new trends in independent publishing: slow journalism and striking images in a generous layout, a sumptuous fanzine produced with love, edited with the right balance of ingenuity and naïveté.What is The Lazlo Reader? After getting more people involved in the editorial process we gave the publication a new format and a new name that better meets the rich amount of material collected and our drive to go deeper, wider and bolder while staying independent, advertising-free, self-published: sharp as a magazine and thorough as a book, it is The Lazlo Reader.Someone would call it a bookazine. We like to think of it as a place of investigation through expression, a platform for diverse minds based in different fields, who are prepared to share their art, research and passion with an equally heterogeneous audience: a hub for debate and creativity.Each volume  will collect interviews, overviews and reviews, pictures and illustrations, works of fiction and non-fiction enquiring into a chosen topic and its implications for sciences and politics, crafts and theories, arts and fashions.Equal attention will be paid to the quality of the content and its layout. We will chase daring ideas and bring them to you in an adventurous design.After months of work and rework, design and delays, copious texts, pictures and illustrations have been collected, proofed and are ready for print. We strove to make The Lazlo Reader bold and beautiful, wide and deep, clean and sharp. We believe we really made it. Now we want our Reader to reach the bookshelf, then your house and see if you feel the same about it. But to that we need you help.How does crowd-funding on Indiegogo works?Until recently, financing a business, project or venture involved asking a few people or a bank for large sums of money. Crowd-funding is turning this idea on its head, using the internet to help entrepreneurs talk to hundreds of potential funders that each contribute a smaller yet decisive amount, receiving some kind of reward in return. This works by placing a campaign on a web platform, in our case Indiegogo.With Indiegogo a project creator pitches an idea, sets a funding goal and a length of time to reach it (deadline). If people like the project, they can pledge (donate) money to make it happen. Creators also honour the pledges with rewards (perks), giving the contributors an additional incentive to support the campaign. We have chosen to set up our campaign as a Fixed Funding, an all-or-nothing funding model where projects must be fully funded or no money (and no rewards) changes hands: backers of our project pledge a certain amount of money, but we only get that money (and they get the rewards) if the total amount of pledges reaches or exceeds our funding goal. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when the time expires and soon they will receive their rewards. If the goal isn’t met by the specified time then no one’s credit card is charged, no reward is sent and the project doesn’t get any of the pledged funds.Donating is easy: in the page you can decide how much contribute, what perk you want and then you will be lead to the PayPal page to execute the payment. You DON'T need to have a PayPal account to contribute, you can also pay with a valid credit card.
Why are we here and where will the money go?
Launching a printed journal is an expensive
(ad)venture.
Lazlo Magazine n°0
was advertising-free and totally self-financed. As a self-published
publication, we want to keep our freedom and creativity, as well as a
top-quality printing and design. That's why we need your help.
The money we raise through this campaign will fund
the printing costs and some production expenses plus the tolls and
fees generated by the campaign itself. Here’s a breakdown of our
estimates.

Printing. Roughly €7.000.
	The magazine will be printed on a high quality, FSC certified, very
	white, very expensive, 120gsm uncoated paper. The printing, cutting
	and binding of The Lazlo Reader n°1 will be executed by a European
	top-notch printing house.


Translations and proofreading, image post-production and proofing. Many contributions in the magazine were
	original written in German, French, Italian or Japanese and need to
	be faithfully translated to English. Before heading to print the
	numerous images are accurately post-produced by professionals.
	€1,000


Rewards Production costs. This goes
	towards the cost associated with the production of our rewards.
	€1.000


Campaign fees. Indiegogo 5% + PayPal
	5%. €1000
Our ideal goal is not only to cover the costs of
Issue n°1, but to raise enough money to independently distribute it
ourselves and plant the seed for future issues. If we're able to
raise money beyond €10,000, we will put that towards shipping the
magazine to magazine shops, bookstores and museums around the world –
avoiding the middleman and keeping the price as low as possible –
and planning the production of more original content for the next
issues.

You can give us feedback about our Indiegogo page and the way we are conducting our campaign, suggest new communication strategies or maybe new perks that we could add. But, most important, you can spread the word: please, send the campaign link to your friends, colleagues and acquaintances in the social networks or via email, talk about us at the beach, the bar or the park, let everybody know about The Lazlo Reader, our goal and rewards.Second Chances – The art of RemakingThe Lazlo Reader, una nuova pubblicazione per la mente insaziabile e l'occhio vorace.Introduzione Second Chances – The Art of Remaking è il primo numero di The Lazlo Reader, un pubblicazione indipendente che dedica ogni volume all'indagine approfondita su un tema specifico.Remaking si traduce letteralmente in italiano in rifare intendendo sia “fare un'altra volta” sia “fare in modo nuovo e differente, in una forma o maniera diversa; rinnovare”. In questo volume investighiamo come negli ultimi decenni questa pratica contraddittoria sia diventata parte dominante delle nostre strategie quotidiane.Il remaking è un'azione dalla doppia natura che da un lato contribuisce a generare lo scenario incerto dei nostri giorni e dall'altro è il modo di negoziare la nostra posizione al suo interno: riproduciamo, copiamo e cloniamo mentre cerchiamo di essere originali, nuovi e unici; campioniamo, citiamo e remixiamo nel tentativo di reinvetarci, di rinnovare i nostri prodotti, disegnare nuovi stili.Second Chances cercherà di capire se copiare non sia solo il modo più efficiente per produrre e diffondere innovazione; se la storia ripeta se stessa; se ogni redesign e revival, traduzione o adattamento non sia in realtà qualcosa di completamente nuovo e unico.Una ricca varietà di autori – circa 60, tra menti affermate e futuri talenti – condivide la propria ricerca sulle mutazioni delle religioni (Domingo Milella, Osamu Tetzuka) e la falsificazione dell'arte (Alicja Kwade, Beate Gutshow), la ri-pianificazione delle nostre città (Raumlabor and raumtaktik) e la rivoluzione delle nostre società (Saskia Sassen, Bifo, Nina Power); la re-invenzione della trazione (Antonio Marras) e il modificare, ritoccare e personalizzare (Massimo Baldwin, Rashad Becker); la cover ed il remix (Joachim Schmidt, Katja Stuke&Oliver Sieber), la copia (Bruce Conner) e la pirateria (Piracy Project).Chi siamo?Un direttore responsabile di base a Berlino, un piccolo un piccolo team internazionale di collaboratori editoriali e un ampio gruppo di autori sparsi per il mondo.Fotografi e illustratori, critici e scrittori, stilisti e accademici squadernano concetti e immagini, sfidano estetiche e visioni del mondo.Appassionati e professionisti, nuove facce e voci conosciute, talenti emergenti e maestri affermati collaborano e  dibattono.Interessi diversi e diversi backgrounds; stili differenti al servizio di un unico scopo: accompagnare il lettore in un viaggio mentale, visuale e intellettuale.Redazione:Direttore Responsabile: Lazlo MoultonArt Director: Luca BendandiPhoto Editor: 3/3Editors at large: Chiara Capodici, Andrea Grippo, Mary CelesteProduzione e comunicazione: SHS PublishingPolitical Editor: Victor Secretan  (Multitude )Illustration Editor: Serena RotaFashion Editor: Maria Grazia LintasDa Lazlo Magazine...Nel Marzo del 2011 abbiamo pubblicato Lazlo Magazine n°0 – ‘On Dwelling’, 160 pagine a colori in cui ci siamo mossi tra città e campagna, tra paesaggi reali e virtuali cercando nuovi e vecchi modi di possedere ed essere posseduti da tempo e spazio, momento e luogo. Questo primo nostro esperimento editoriale, autoprodotto e senza pubblicità ha incontrato un'accoglienza particolarmente positiva da parte del pubblico e della critica e, stampato in un edizione limitata di 1000 copie è ora un ricercato oggetto da collezionisti.… a The Lazlo ReaderDopo aver coinvolto nuove forze nel processo editoriale abbiamo dato alla nostra pubblicazione un nuovo formato e un nuovo nome che meglio ci consente di gestire il volume di materiale raccolto e che meglio corrisponde alla nostra volontà di andare più affondo, di allargare lo sguardo e osare di più sempre rimanendo indipendenti e senza pubblicità: nasce così The Lazlo Reader.Qualcuno la chiamerebbe una bookazine, a metà strada tra libro e magazine. Per noi è un luogo per il dibattito e la creatività, una piattaforma per menti diverse provenienti da campi diversi, pronte a condividere la propria arte, passione e ricerca con un pubblico ugualmente eterogeneo.In ogni volume interviste, articoli e recensioni, fotografie e illustrazioni, saggi e racconti affrontano un argomento e ne indagano le implicazioni per le scienze e la politica, le arti e la moda, la teoria e le prassi.La stessa cura verrà dedicata alla qualità dei contenuti e alla sua impaginazione. Andremo alla ricerca delle idee più coraggiose e vele porteremo in un design rigoroso e moderno.Autori:Copertina: Alicja Kwade  Immagini (illustrazioni, collages, fotografie e embroideries on fabric):  Jan Brockhaus, Pia Zölzer,  Bill Noir, Lucio ‘Basik’ Bolognesi, Madalena Matoso, Ruggero Asnago, Beate Gütschow, Antonio di Cecco, Massimo Mastrolillo, René Clément and Henri Decaë, Anthony Minghella and John Seale, Giovanni Del Brenna, Giorgio Di Noto, Broomberg & Chanarin, Andras Calamandrei, Giuliano Matteucci, Domingo Milella, Bruce Conner, Daniela Comani, Doug Rickard, John Gossage   Fumetto: Osamu TezukaRemix: Oliver Sieber & Katja Stuke, Joachim SchmidParole Crociate: Emilio Pianotesti (articoli, recensioni e interviste di e con):  Chiara Capodici, Jens Hoffmann and Chelsea Haines (The Exhibitonist), Pro Qm Berlin, Rashad Becker, Arno Raffeiner, Andrea Grippo, Marco Lecis, raumtaktik, Franco Stella, Martino Sacchi, Raumlabor, Jakob Tigges, Marco Morante, Aristotelis Vasilakos (Assetto Corsa - Power and Glory), Leo Goldsmith, Massimo Baldwin, Lazlo Moulton, Hailey LaVoy, Tony McKibbin, Gal Kirn, Anne Querrien, Victor Secretan, Lucia Sagradini, John Holloway, José Chatroussat, Sleh Dine Kchouk, Saskia Sassen, Federico Campagna, Nina Power, Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi, Lynn Harris and Eva Weinmayr (The Piracy Project), Amedeo Martegani and Giulia di Lenarda (A+M Bookstore), Antonio Marras, Maria Grazia Lintas, Bastian Tebarth, Sebastian Arthur Hau, Daniel Kasman, Mary CelesteTutti insieme abbiamo lavorato per mesi e mesi per rendere The Lazlo Reader più grande, più interessante, più bello. Pensiamo di esserci riusciti. Ora vogliamo che il nostro Reader raggiunga le librerie e le vostre case e sapere se anche voi la pensate così. Ma perché questo succeda abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto.Come funziona il crowfunding su Indiegogo.Il creatore di un progetto presenta un’idea, stabilisce un capitale come obiettivo (goal) che intende raggiungere con la campagna － necessario per il finanziamento del progetto － e una data (deadline) entro la quale quell’obiettivo deve essere raggiunto. Se il pubblico apprezza il progetto, può donare denaro per renderne possibile la realizzazione. I creatori inoltre premiano le donazioni con una ricompensa che rappresenta un ulteriore incentivo al sostegno del progetto. Se allo scadere della data stabilita viene raggiunto l'obiettivo, automaticamente il pagamento viene addebitato sulla carta di credito dei donatori e qualche tempo dopo questi riceveranno le ricompense; se invece l'obiettivo non viene raggiunto entro il tempo specificato, il pagamento non viene addebitato e nessuna ricompensa verrà corrisposta.Donare è facile: in questa pagina puoi scegliere quanto donare, quale ricompensa vuoi e poi verrai rediretto alla pagina di Indiegogo per eseguire il pagamento. Non hai bisogno di PayPal per contribuire, è sufficiente una carta di credito valida.Perché siamo qui e dove andranno i vostri soldi.Pubblicare un volume stampato è un impresa molto costosa.Come rivista autoprodotta vogliamo mantenere la nostra libertà e creatività editoriale, senza compromettere la qualità di design e strampa. Ecco perché siamo qui a chiedere il vostro aiuto.I soldi che raccoglieremo attraverso questa campagna copriranno i costi di stampa, alcune spese di produzione più le spese fisse dovute alla campagna stessa. Ecco una stima delle spese:Stampa. €7.000 circa. La rivista sarà stampata su carta usomano di alta qualità da 120gsm, certificata FSC, ultrabianca e particolarmente cara. La stampa e la rilegatura di The Lazlo Reader n°1verrà eseguita da una stamperia europea di prim'ordine.Traduzione e proofreading, post produzione e proofing delle immagini, €1,000 Molti dei testi contenuti nel volume sono stati originariamente scritti in tedesco, italiano, francese o giapponese e abbiamo quindi dovuto tradurli fedelmente in inglese. Le molte immagini prima di andare in stampa devono essere corrette e controllate da professionisti. Produzione e spedizione delle ricompense per la campagna, €1.000 Percentuali da pagare a Indiegogo. Indiegogo 5% + PayPal 5%. €1000   Il nostro obbiettivo ideale è non solo di coprire i costi di The Lazlo Reader n°1, ma di raccogliere abbastanza denaro da poter distribuire il volume indipendentemente e piantare i semi di futuri uscite. Se saremmo capaci di andare oltre i €10.000, destineremo i fondi in eccesso alla spedizione della nostra rivista alle librerie e negozi specializzati e ai musei intorno al mondo – evitando intermediari e tenendo così il prezzo il più basso possibile – e organizzare la produzione di ulteriori contenuti originali per le prossime uscite.Altri modi di aiutare.Se ti piace il nostro progetto ma non puoi donare, non preoccuparti, ci sono altri modi in cui ci puoi dare una mano. Facci sapere cosa pensi della nostra pagina su Indiegogo e di come stiamo portando avanti la campagna, suggeriscici nuove strategie comunicative o magari qualche genere di ricompensa che dovremmo aggiungere. Ma, cosa ancora più importante, contribuisci al passaparola: passa i link della campagna ai tuoi amici, conoscenti e colleghi sui social network o attraverso la mail, parla di noi sotto l'ombrellone, al bar o al parco.

</p><p>Hello.
 I am David.  Thank you for your interest in the project.  The 
project that I am raising funds for is two fold.  I was teaching an
11<sup>th</sup> grade English class years ago and the topic for that
day was Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson had said earlier in his life
that he considered his writings as his saving account.  The students
said, “That is like your drawings and writings, Mr. Arvin.”  I
have always believed this was true of my work.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The
second and more important part of the project is getting the work out
there for the public. “Art only lives when people see it.” 
Picasso</p>

<p>“Last but not least, I know your artwork is pure joy.
									People buy art because of the way it makes them feel. I know

									getting it seen. You'll bring so much happiness into
									people's lives.”  Robin Hoshino</p>

goal of the project is to get my fine arts business up and running. 
The business is multifaceted.  Drawings, Photography, Writings, and
more.  The long term goal is to do it all and more.  Now let us look
at some  samples of the work and what I plan to do with it.

<br/></div>","Hello.
 I am David.  Thank you for your interest in the project.  The 
project that I am raising funds for is two fold.  I was teaching an
11th grade English class years ago and the topic for that
day was Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson had said earlier in his life
that he considered his writings as his saving account.  The students
said, “That is like your drawings and writings, Mr. Arvin.”  I
have always believed this was true of my work.  


The
second and more important part of the project is getting the work out
there for the public. “Art only lives when people see it.” 
Picasso









“Last but not least, I know your artwork is pure joy.
									People buy art because of the way it makes them feel. I know
									there is a market for your work, it's just a matter of
									getting it seen. You'll bring so much happiness into
									people's lives.”  Robin Hoshino










The
goal of the project is to get my fine arts business up and running. 
The business is multifaceted.  Drawings, Photography, Writings, and
more.  The long term goal is to do it all and more.  Now let us look
at some  samples of the work and what I plan to do with it. 


DRAWINGS


The
art is interactive. Very few of them have titles because the viewers
imagination is part of the art.  If you see it, it is there. 
               


I
like to work with color.  Depth by color.  Depending on how you
combine the colors to form what you see the positive and negative
space changes.




The
'hidden' classical triangle, the flat surface of the cubists, the 

almost
 childlike surrealism, the bright colors in a dark world.

We even struggle to empathize with other humans that don’t look like us.  We are trying to create what feels like a presence there with you; something that is trying to understand you and you could relate back.  Your support can make this possible!Emergence is solely funded by our team and our community, and we need your help! In order to kick start our efforts, we’ve put forward our own funding and secured a few private donations to seed the project, but we need our community’s generosity and support to make it a reality. Here’s how you can help today:
Donate through Indiegogo (make sure to check out the donation tiers for Emergence gifts and perks!)
Share this campaign on your social channels to help us drive awareness
Volunteer!  We could use your help in building the project on Treasure Island in San Francisco and early on the playa.  Please contact us at: volunteer@emergencejourney.org

*We have a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship.  For those interested in learning more about making a tax deductible donation, please contact us at contact@emergencejourney.org Thank You!We would like to thank everyone for your support. One of the most integral parts of success for this project is awareness! Telling your friends, family, and colleagues about this project in person is the best way to get people involved. We also encourage everyone to use Indiegogo's ""share"" feature to help spread the word about the Emergence fundraiser on social media. Liking our Facebook page Emergence is the best way to get updates about whats going on with Emergence and the team, it is also where we will publicly thank our donors.   Project Costs Project Timeline Emergence Team LeadsVitaly Winter, Lead ArtistI first came to Burning Man to build a home.  What profoundly touched me, was the art and the sheer amount of creativity that fostered a meaningful experience.  It has inspired me to use my engineering talents to create a powerful experience for others and, in kind, bring meaning to their lives.  My inspiration for Emergence stems from my ongoing philosophical pursuit about our nature and existence. My wish is for this art to bring more questions than answers. Jean-Michel Fabregon, Project Lead and Design For as long as I can remember, I’ve been passionate with creating and building all sorts of things. I came to San Francisco from France after graduating from Design school and decided to stay after falling in love with the city and the Bay Area. When Vitaly first told me about the project I got very excited and it was clear to me that I needed to be a part of it and to contribute by offering my knowledge and talent to others.Nick Reimnitz, Lead Mechanical DesignerBurning Man culture has reignited my childhood wonder in creating for the sake of joy and connection. Since that first life changing event, I have strived to use my mechanical engineering background to stoke the fire of my art and creativity. Emergence was a perfect fit for me, and when invited to the project it was a no-brainer! Lidia Darkova, Fundraising and StorytellingI am an artist, designer, marketer and a burner. Through Burning Man, I discovered a deep satisfaction that comes from using art to help people communicate thoughts, ideas, and emotions that can't be expressed with words alone. As a community we constantly evolve in our artistic endeavors, technology and knowledge and now we face a new journey into the unknown of Artificial Intelligence. I'm so incredibly honored to be a part of the Emergence project that is not only artistic, but thought provoking as well. Nathaniel Hedges, Creative DirectorI am creative director for a lighting design agency that specializes in immersive art experiences. In my former life I supported Naval Special Warefare as a trauma/deep-sea diving medic for eleven or so years of honorable service.  After attending Burning Man for the first time in 2013 I’ve committed myself to building art installations on the Playa year-after-year: Temple of Grace 2014Catacomb of Veils 2016Tree of Ténéré 2017I’m super stoked to work on Emergence in 2018.  See you on the Playa y’all!  Eric Mintzer, Software Infrastructure DesignI am thrilled to be part of a team merging advanced technologies from mechanical, software, and design in to a single comprehensive vision that will hatch on the playa. My maker background is geeking out over pushing the technical limits across disciplines and my creative background is curious to discover how Emergence will evolve before and on the playa. David Marchaland, Embedded ControlsAfter my first burn in 2016, I knew that becoming involved with an art project will be part of a next journey to Home.  This year, I had the opportunity to board in the Emergence journey, a subtle balance between art and technology.  Living in SF and working as an electrical engineer, I cannot be more excited to bring a technical experience to the creation of an hardware and software platform to give life to an inert structure.  Let’s motor and LEDs! Liza Lichtinger, MA, LMHC, LPCC, Robotic and Behavioral Interaction AdvisorThe intent of this project is to harness the fire which fuels emergent technology gracefully, to  direct profound behavioral shifts within all whom come across the gifts hatched from this egg. Partners & Collaborators

<p> Every year our middle school spends a week creating products to sell in order to fund raise, we call this week, Maker Immersion Week. During Maker Immersion week we learned new skills surrounding clay and studio art. Without this fundraising, we would not have the ability to go on unique field trips later in the school year, including a three day overnight trip to the Mt. Lemmon Sky Center Observatory, or Sky School. We also have the opportunity to visit our local planetarium, the Jewish History Museum, and more. Not many schools get an opportunity to experience trips like this, and we are very fortunate but we need funding to make them happen. </p>
<p>We are selling one of a kind pieces of art, handmade by passionate art students. A majority of our perks are handcrafted clay works. We are selling everything from mugs to jewelry dishes in a variety of sizes. A great deal of effort went into these items and the final products are high quality beautiful clay works. Also being sold is a unique painting on wood, depicted is a black and gray acrylic steam engine on a handcrafted unique background. Every contribution makes a difference and is greatly appreciated. Every year our school has a similar fundraising week and have yet to get a negative review. Our products are high quality and are worth every penny spent. If you like what you see, share this campaign. Contributions are greatly appreciated, thank you for helping us reach our $500 goal.  </p>

What is ART SPACE FOR SPACE ART?
The ART SPACE FOR SPACE ART campaign is the worldwide first art event in space - a historic project for our mankind.You might ask yourself what is the link between art and space? Space and the dream to find a second earth in the universe always carried a tremendous fascination for people, while the desire to dive into a new world is also an important task of art.The way we explore the galaxy is changing dramatically since the last years with huge private investments of Richard Branson, Elon Musk and other visionaries. Now it gets time for the ""Space 2.0"" mission of contemporary art.
I will trigger this by executing as first artist an art project in space, which should not only geographically widen the horizon of the human world.

I started already with my astronaut training and successfully passed the G-force-test.



How to finance and execute this project?
The ""ART SPACE"" project phase requires an involvement of around 200 artists from all countries in the world to design their proposal for the flag for the space or universe, a public web-page for an online voting of the winning flag, a similar number of actors in the Mojave desert which represent the earth and a merry-go-around as symbol for childhood, gravity and it's analogy to the biblical Ark Noah. The unique picture will be taken also from a helicopter perspective. The estimated project cost for the ""ART SPACE"" project has been calculated with US30.000$.The final ""SPACE ART"" project phase is planned for 2016, right after the development of the spacecraft from ZENOVISION. Their spacecraft will be specialized on broadcasting and camera technology, this is the main reason why I have chosen ZENOVISION for the sub-orbital flight and this art project.

In case the IndieGoGo funding campaign will not cover the entire amount, I will apply for institutional or corporate art sponsoring programs to close the gap. Not realizing this art project is NO OPTION! What is your benefit for supporting this initiative?


Your funding will help me to realize the dream to connects the art world with the discovery of the universe, which is a unique source for inspiration and creativity.
I will offer very special perks for all supporters, like:


E-Book, ART SPACE or SPACE ART catalog from the artist
Participating as actor in the Mojave desert (ART SPACE)

Signed fine art prints from the ART SPACE or SPACE ART project

Publishing the sponsor names on a webpage, logo shirt or even broadcasting it live from the sub-orbit in a banner 
Receiving a original piece of the space flag in a frame (which was used for the SPACE ART project)

<li>I have framed my original paintings and high quality prints for shows: a light mat and simple frame is usually required.  I have reframed one painting for the gallery and it has cost over $600.00!  I won't be choosing frames as fancy (or costly) but the work will have to be brought up to this gallery's expectations.</li>

<li>I have beautiful giclee prints of my work available for you as a reward for your support.  These prints are printed on 100% cotton art paper and the inks are guaranteed to last 125 years in normal interior conditions. (yes, they are in a protected area right now.)</li>

<li>I have chosen a flexible campaign so even if I don't reach my entire goal I will be able to provide fewer pieces of framed work and several unframed prints.  This also means you will get your perk even if the goal isn't reached.</li>

<li>a FREE art educational program that has been planting the seeds for social change through art practices for 10 years now.</li>
<li>an open studio for young artists and artistic youth in Armenia․</li>
</ul><p>MEDIALAB</p><ul>
<li>provides students with technical and theoretical knowledge in various disciplines of art, including photography, video-making, creative writing, exposition work, etc.</li>
<li>develops critical thinking and artistic skills in youth artists, as well as the cultivation of a personal art style.</li>
</ul><p>What’s else?  <br/>MEDIALAB is a unique opportunity for artistic youth to:</p><ul>
<li>implement individual projects</li>
<li>receive free consultation and technical support</li>
<li>become a part of local and international artistic networks and create new collaborations in the field.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Isn’t this all a young artist needs while taking first steps in the field?</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550248035/dmwtwquz6t1x7l1jxrua.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>MEDIALAB students during “Camera Operating Skills” workshop</i></p><h3>________</h3><h2>WHO RUNS THE PROGRAM? </h2><p>We are a group of friends that consists of artists and experts who have art experience in various settings: through outdated academic art education, alternative art educational practices, and even self-education. With all of our combined experience, we were inspired to establish a unique program that implements the best methods from each type of education in order to create new opportunities for the younger generation.</p><p>At the heart of the program is our vision of how education should be and we have created an environment that allows this vision to become a reality. We have designed a program that inspires students to enjoy art, learn its social impact and importance, and encourages them to become active members of the art community and in society as a whole. <strong>We truly believe that being an artist is not only about having technical skills, but first of all about having the ability to think outside the box—to be daring enough to question everyday boundaries. MEDIALAB is an environment where these potentials, mental skills, and practices are stimulated and strengthened.</strong></p><h3>________</h3><h2>Our history and experience</h2><p>We started 10 years ago as a video-editing and photo shooting workshop, and 5 years later we started organizing a semi-annual program which provided both technical and theoretical knowledge to artists and amateurs.<br/><br/>Throughout these 10 years we have established the foundation of our future school by:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>continually expanding and elaborating on our list of workshops</strong>, most of which are not available in any other art educational institution in Armenia.</li>
<li>
<strong>developing unique teaching methods and curricula</strong> for our programs.</li>
<li>procuring a good reputation and possessing a <strong>significant role in the field of art education in Armenia.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>developing a large network of local and international partners</strong> which includes the expanding list of the <strong>best young specialists and instructors, </strong>experts and consultants, partner institutions, etc.</li>
<li>creating a <strong>technically well-equipped workshop and laboratory, together with a professional library,</strong> all which provide our students with the necessary resources and environment for their professional growth.</li>
<li>
<strong>reaching a high level of competitiveness,</strong> <strong>typically receiving 10 applications per place–</strong>among them students and alumni from all types of artistic and cultural institutions.</li>
<li>preparing and encouraging our <strong>students to get involved and established in different art fields in Armenia</strong>, by creating artistic groups and institutions, becoming employees and members of different art institutions, developing individual projects, etc.</li>
</ul><p>These 10 years have not been without challenges. We have experienced various crises and transformations. However, unlike many similar schools which have stopped operating because of obstacles, we were the only organization that managed to survive and even thrive. We have made it to where we are, having a $0 budget for operations for several years—friendship and enthusiasm being the main and only capital of the project.</p><p>And now, with 10 years of experience—with our success and growing popularity—<strong>we aspire to evolve and expand even further so that we can</strong> <strong>BETTER SERVE</strong> <strong>&amp;</strong> <strong>OFFER MORE</strong> <strong>to our community.</strong></p><p><strong>Being a non profit initiative, we rely on your donation to make it happen.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552599457/pvse7j8h60q8vdne2yei.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>________</h3><h3>Please consider donating if:</h3><p>- you believe in free alternative art education in the new Armenia.<br/>- you would like to contribute to the modernization of Armenian society and artistic youth.</p><h3><strong>By donating to MEDIALAB your support will have a<br/>far-reaching effect on building a new future.</strong></h3><h3>________</h3><h2>How to Help &amp; What You Get</h2><p>The raised prices are for a variety of purposes.

</h2></div>","MEDIALAB is:
a FREE art educational program that has been planting the seeds for social change through art practices for 10 years now.
an open studio for young artists and artistic youth in Armenia․
MEDIALAB
provides students with technical and theoretical knowledge in various disciplines of art, including photography, video-making, creative writing, exposition work, etc.
develops critical thinking and artistic skills in youth artists, as well as the cultivation of a personal art style.
What’s else?  MEDIALAB is a unique opportunity for artistic youth to:
implement individual projects
receive free consultation and technical support
become a part of local and international artistic networks and create new collaborations in the field.
Isn’t this all a young artist needs while taking first steps in the field?MEDIALAB students during “Camera Operating Skills” workshop________WHO RUNS THE PROGRAM? We are a group of friends that consists of artists and experts who have art experience in various settings: through outdated academic art education, alternative art educational practices, and even self-education. With all of our combined experience, we were inspired to establish a unique program that implements the best methods from each type of education in order to create new opportunities for the younger generation.At the heart of the program is our vision of how education should be and we have created an environment that allows this vision to become a reality. We have designed a program that inspires students to enjoy art, learn its social impact and importance, and encourages them to become active members of the art community and in society as a whole. We truly believe that being an artist is not only about having technical skills, but first of all about having the ability to think outside the box—to be daring enough to question everyday boundaries. MEDIALAB is an environment where these potentials, mental skills, and practices are stimulated and strengthened.________Our history and experienceWe started 10 years ago as a video-editing and photo shooting workshop, and 5 years later we started organizing a semi-annual program which provided both technical and theoretical knowledge to artists and amateurs.Throughout these 10 years we have established the foundation of our future school by:

continually expanding and elaborating on our list of workshops, most of which are not available in any other art educational institution in Armenia.

developing unique teaching methods and curricula for our programs.
procuring a good reputation and possessing a significant role in the field of art education in Armenia.


developing a large network of local and international partners which includes the expanding list of the best young specialists and instructors, experts and consultants, partner institutions, etc.
creating a technically well-equipped workshop and laboratory, together with a professional library, all which provide our students with the necessary resources and environment for their professional growth.

reaching a high level of competitiveness, typically receiving 10 applications per place–among them students and alumni from all types of artistic and cultural institutions.
preparing and encouraging our students to get involved and established in different art fields in Armenia, by creating artistic groups and institutions, becoming employees and members of different art institutions, developing individual projects, etc.
These 10 years have not been without challenges. We have experienced various crises and transformations. However, unlike many similar schools which have stopped operating because of obstacles, we were the only organization that managed to survive and even thrive. We have made it to where we are, having a $0 budget for operations for several years—friendship and enthusiasm being the main and only capital of the project.And now, with 10 years of experience—with our success and growing popularity—we aspire to evolve and expand even further so that we can BETTER SERVE & OFFER MORE to our community.Being a non profit initiative, we rely on your donation to make it happen.________Please consider donating if:- you believe in free alternative art education in the new Armenia.- you would like to contribute to the modernization of Armenian society and artistic youth.By donating to MEDIALAB your support will have afar-reaching effect on building a new future.________How to Help & What You GetThe raised prices are for a variety of purposes.

Richardson, a well known postmodern sculptor whose works cover the spectrum of fantasy, dark art, mystical art, and art nouveau, as well as the distinct flavor of the macabre, has a knack for transforming his sculpture into surreal depiction. Fans of the imagery who study his artwork are going to eagerly anticipate the transition from art that is seen to the art that is worn.

<p>Richardson’s artistry has been able to transcend media for much of his professional career. He began drawing and sculpting at a young age, and early on, he was captivated by the creatures of the unknown and unseen. It was when he was in high school, when he began working in art studios around his home town, that he became immersed in all aspects of sculpture and the lost wax process.

His work with celebrities has also brought him into contact with the Hell’s Angels motorcycle group. The diversity of his circle of admirers demonstrates the versatility of his message and the manner in which his embrace of the life-death-rebirth cycle translates easily into other perspectives.
