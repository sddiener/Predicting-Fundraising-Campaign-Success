The goal of “Skin” is to bring eating disorders into public awareness and prevent these illnesses through the power of art and artistic expression.

As my weight diminished my entire persona changed as I became increasingly obsessive about and addicted to  my eating disorder. I spent months in recovery and will forever be grateful that I had such a strong support system among my friends and family.  However,  I  realized there was a huge lack of understanding of and education for eating disorders.  Often I would hear “just stop” or “if you really wanted to you could.” I found that my loved ones did not understand the severity of what I was going through. I felt powerless over my disorders, as though I couldn’t stop even if it would save my life.  Eating disorders are not a choice but a severe psychological and physical disorder. Eating disorders affect almost 3 million people in the US alone. Social pressures and ideas of beauty alongside psychological factors and genetics can all play a role in the development of eating disorders.  It is my dream in life to have eating disorders be erased forever. I want so badly for people to be acknowledged for who they are on the inside as opposed to the outside and for women and men to be recognized for inner beauty.  My goal for this show is not only to educate others on eating disorders but also promote healthy body images and self love. </span></p></span></li></ol>

Some of us do this with ease, and some of us struggle to fit comfortably in our own skin.  We can become obsessed with the outside because we aren’t satisfied with who we are on the inside.  We try to match others because we admire who they are and not who we are ourselves. This piece will be about the journey of self acceptance and self love, and it will be focused around the idea of figuring out who we are. When we learn to appreciate the person we are on the inside, we can then learn to appreciate our body and our appearance, and we can learn to let go of the idea that appearance is what makes us the person we are. We become comfortable with ourselves and comfortable in our skin.</span></p></span></li></ol>

My name is Kris Noteboom and this is my Indiegogo campaign.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><br/></p><p><b>The Project</b></p><p>My project is a one man show called <i>...and then I woke up.</i> It's a comedic look at my very real trouble with sleeping and dreaming throughout my life, and my very existential trouble with the collective American Dream. Don't worry, though. I stay away from heavy handed stuff and instead focus on a series of humorous anecdotes from my life that cover my nightmare dominated childhood, my disastrous first audition, a strange sex dream, sexy vampires, and my forays into the odd world of performance art. It's a romp of an hour, using only my bed as my prop in which I give the audience a very, and often embarrassing, intimate look into my life in a way that everyone can identify with. </p><p><b>Who am I?</b></p><p>Now my brief bio: As a performer, I've been on stages since before I knew I was on them. I had no idea what I was doing in my first audition for the talent show in 2nd grade. I just knew I wanted to be up there on stage. As I got older, I got a little more formal in my pursuits, taking part in theater from junior high through college. After a brief foray into the corporate world, I decided to go back to school and get my masters in Performance Studies. And, if you're wondering what that is, so was I when I started. But, in that program I learned performance art. Theaters strange cousin. I admit to this day that I could never quite figure it out, but I loved it. Now, I'm working on my PhD, also in performance art, at UT Dallas. This is where I developed this show. Beyond that, I've worked as a writer and critic for a prominent local arts site in Dallas/Ft. Worth called Theater Jones for the last five years. In pretty much every  way, theater and performance is my life...now. </p><p>The show chronicles my circuitous journey to this point, when I often tried to be the person other people said I should be. That's kind of the point, though I never hammer it too much in the show. I find it's much more fun to writhe on my bed and run from Tom Cruise.</p><p><b>Why the campaign?</b></p><p>This summer, I'm embarking on a tour of theater festivals across the country. Tentatively, I'm calling it my Compass Tour, as I'm hitting north (Chicago), south (Dallas), east (Washington D.C.) and west (Hollywood).</p><p>Dallas Solo Fest - June 4-7</p><p>Hollywood Fringe Festival - June 12-20</p><p>Capital Fringe Festival - July 10-18</p><p>Chicago Fringe Festival - September TBA</p><p>Festivals are a great way for a performer to establish themselves, and I've been incredibly fortunate to be accepted to four different festivals.</p><p>However, there are costs associated with this. Costs that I can't full cover by myself. That's why I'm asking for your support.</p><p><b>What am I asking for and what does it go to?</b></p><p>I've set my campaign for a $6,000 flexible funding goal. </p><p>The costs of doing this tour involve the following</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Venue Fees - This is the cost of renting the venue, and includes paying vital staff like a Stage Manager and Technical Director. It's great to be accepted to these festivals, but they're facilitators more than anything. I'm still producing the show myself. And that means paying for the venue and staff, without who the show would be impossible.</li>
<li>Insurance - The show has to be insured.</li>
<li>Travel - Plane tickets, transportation when I'm in each city, etc.</li>
<li>Lodging - I pride myself on being frugal and will sleep on as many couches as possible, but there will be a few night when AirBNB will be my friend.</li>
<li>Food - I'll be in each of these locations (minus Dallas, where I live) for two weeks at a time. And despite my ampleness, I do have to eat.</li>
<li>Publicity/Advertising - Getting people to come to the show takes a lot of work, and a lot of postcards and flyers.</li>
</ul><div>I do earn a percentage of ticket sales at these events, but this income is somewhat unreliable and doesn't arrive until well after the festival is over. Though, I have factored it into my calculations of what I can contribute to this project.</div><div>I'm not asking for the full cost of this odyssey. In fact, I've already paid a lot of money out of pocket, and will continue to do so as much as possible. </div><div>I'm asking for about a third of the total cost. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My parents raised me to work for what I get, and I'm doing as much of that as possible. </span>
</div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">But, patronage has always been an important part of the arts, and sites like Indigogo help less established artists, who don't have as much access to funds, get their work off the ground and seen. And in the arts world, it takes being seen to get momentum and become self-sustaining. I'm asking for a supportive nudge in that direction.</span></div><div>Check<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> out this video about the 1,000 true fans theory of artistic careers these days:</span>

As a young performer, I don't have a brand to fall back on. I doubt many people would be too excited by a random t-shirt or coffee mug, so I really pushed myself to figure out some interesting and unique rewards, as well as the most conventional reward, a ticket to a future show.</div><div>About that. I can't use tickets for the festivals in this campaign. These performances are part of festivals and I can't walk in and say, ""Hey, I've sold like 50 tickets through my crowdsourcing campaign."" That's won't fly. </div><div>So, what I'm going to do is host a series of intimate performance of 30-40 people late this year, after the tour. I have a cool venue for this here in Ft.

My name is Kris Noteboom and this is my Indiegogo campaign.The ProjectMy project is a one man show called ...and then I woke up. It's a comedic look at my very real trouble with sleeping and dreaming throughout my life, and my very existential trouble with the collective American Dream. Don't worry, though. I stay away from heavy handed stuff and instead focus on a series of humorous anecdotes from my life that cover my nightmare dominated childhood, my disastrous first audition, a strange sex dream, sexy vampires, and my forays into the odd world of performance art. It's a romp of an hour, using only my bed as my prop in which I give the audience a very, and often embarrassing, intimate look into my life in a way that everyone can identify with. Who am I?Now my brief bio: As a performer, I've been on stages since before I knew I was on them. I had no idea what I was doing in my first audition for the talent show in 2nd grade. I just knew I wanted to be up there on stage. As I got older, I got a little more formal in my pursuits, taking part in theater from junior high through college. After a brief foray into the corporate world, I decided to go back to school and get my masters in Performance Studies. And, if you're wondering what that is, so was I when I started. But, in that program I learned performance art. Theaters strange cousin. I admit to this day that I could never quite figure it out, but I loved it. Now, I'm working on my PhD, also in performance art, at UT Dallas. This is where I developed this show. Beyond that, I've worked as a writer and critic for a prominent local arts site in Dallas/Ft. Worth called Theater Jones for the last five years. In pretty much every  way, theater and performance is my life...now. The show chronicles my circuitous journey to this point, when I often tried to be the person other people said I should be. That's kind of the point, though I never hammer it too much in the show. I find it's much more fun to writhe on my bed and run from Tom Cruise.Why the campaign?This summer, I'm embarking on a tour of theater festivals across the country. Tentatively, I'm calling it my Compass Tour, as I'm hitting north (Chicago), south (Dallas), east (Washington D.C.) and west (Hollywood).Dallas Solo Fest - June 4-7Hollywood Fringe Festival - June 12-20Capital Fringe Festival - July 10-18Chicago Fringe Festival - September TBAFestivals are a great way for a performer to establish themselves, and I've been incredibly fortunate to be accepted to four different festivals.However, there are costs associated with this. Costs that I can't full cover by myself. That's why I'm asking for your support.What am I asking for and what does it go to?I've set my campaign for a $6,000 flexible funding goal. The costs of doing this tour involve the following
Venue Fees - This is the cost of renting the venue, and includes paying vital staff like a Stage Manager and Technical Director. It's great to be accepted to these festivals, but they're facilitators more than anything. I'm still producing the show myself. And that means paying for the venue and staff, without who the show would be impossible.
Insurance - The show has to be insured.
Travel - Plane tickets, transportation when I'm in each city, etc.
Lodging - I pride myself on being frugal and will sleep on as many couches as possible, but there will be a few night when AirBNB will be my friend.
Food - I'll be in each of these locations (minus Dallas, where I live) for two weeks at a time. And despite my ampleness, I do have to eat.
Publicity/Advertising - Getting people to come to the show takes a lot of work, and a lot of postcards and flyers.
I do earn a percentage of ticket sales at these events, but this income is somewhat unreliable and doesn't arrive until well after the festival is over. Though, I have factored it into my calculations of what I can contribute to this project.I'm not asking for the full cost of this odyssey. In fact, I've already paid a lot of money out of pocket, and will continue to do so as much as possible. I'm asking for about a third of the total cost. My parents raised me to work for what I get, and I'm doing as much of that as possible. 
But, patronage has always been an important part of the arts, and sites like Indigogo help less established artists, who don't have as much access to funds, get their work off the ground and seen. And in the arts world, it takes being seen to get momentum and become self-sustaining. I'm asking for a supportive nudge in that direction.Check out this video about the 1,000 true fans theory of artistic careers these days:
And, it doesn't go unrewarded!Incentives!I've done my best to come up with a few interesting incentives for your investment. As a young performer, I don't have a brand to fall back on. I doubt many people would be too excited by a random t-shirt or coffee mug, so I really pushed myself to figure out some interesting and unique rewards, as well as the most conventional reward, a ticket to a future show.About that. I can't use tickets for the festivals in this campaign. These performances are part of festivals and I can't walk in and say, ""Hey, I've sold like 50 tickets through my crowdsourcing campaign."" That's won't fly. So, what I'm going to do is host a series of intimate performance of 30-40 people late this year, after the tour. I have a cool venue for this here in Ft. Worth, and drinks, snacks and fellowship will be provided for a fun evening.If you're not in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area and are still interested in seeing the show, it will work one of two ways. If enough people buy the show ticket from a specific town, I can get a space in that town and get the show produced. The demand makes that easy. Or, I'm putting a traveling show option where a group of people can band together and purchase it, offsetting individual costs and making it easier for me to travel and see you. Look through the incentives/rewards for more details...Like and Share!Whether you can afford to contribute or not, the one thing you can do that would help immensely is to share the campaign with your friends.

<h3>The Pitch - TüManz 2k17</h3>
<p>The year is 2071. In a totalitarian dictatorship not too far away, ‘The Ideas Man’ (a slovenly television personality turned despot) has enslaved humanity with subliminal messages.</p>
<p>But this phantasmic dictator has run outta spark. He's looking to rebrand, anxious that his particular method of hypnotism isn't manipulating quite as well as it used to. He needs a new means of control over his increasingly conspiratorial public. The solution? Mind control through film! </p>
<p>He’s summoned Tü Manz to a bunker. Armed with a top-secret library of every film ever produced, the Manz are tasked with determining which genre-combinations will prove the most effective for subconsciously weaponising an increasingly canny public.</p>
<p>Cue the riotous combination of self-aggrandising genius Saul Boyer and dyspraxic pedant Sam Rayner. The pair desperately squabble over their favourite genres in an attempt to secure their fate: lionisation over liquidation!</p>
<p>The show is part narrative double-act - in which our TüManz play themselves - and part sketch extravaganza. The ultimate hybrid – and the vehicle for The Ideas Man’s new brand of world domination.</p>
<p>This is sketch comedy like you've never seen it before. Double the daring. Triple the titters, quadruple the quadrangles! It's a bloody bonanza that will have you laughing like ...drains! Expect S&amp;M musketeers; Jewish mafiosi; a courtroom Telenovela; and a piratical zero gravity space opera! </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>It Starts With Us</h2>
<p>       Did you watch the Tony's this year? Ever wonder where those brilliant artists and entertainers come from? Most of them began their careers in healthy theatre communitites with local organizations that allowed them to not only find their passion for performing, writing or designing, but also gave them a chance to actually practice it. Here at Off-Strip Productions, we belive talent is cultivated through diverse experience and that's what we offer to artists in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>       Off-Strip Productions is a non-profit (501(c)(3)) organization that makes its home inside the charmingly intimate Onyx Theatre. Our mission is to encourage cultural accessibility and growth by collaborating with our arts community to provide first class, affordable entertainment with an innovative, in-your-face style taht you cannot get anywhere else in the Valley. From classic Broadway musicals to original, home-grown, works, we actively support opportunities for local artists through a teamwork approach to the creation of live theatre.</p>
<p>       Your contributions are essential to making this mission possible, thereby granting opportunities to local actors, directors, designers, musicians and more to exercise their crafts and gain the necessary experience not found in books or classrooms.</p>
<p>       Also by suporting us you are strengthening an entire community. In addition to the individual artists, we have and continue to partner with many local organizations that are similar to Off-Strip, but who have no home of their own companies like Poor Richard's Players, Table 8 Productions, Huntsman Entertainment, Rag Tag Entertainment, Sin City Opera and more.</p>
<p>       These are just a handful of the groups that share our vision for the Vegas tehatre scene. We work with them, providing a venue and whatever resources we can to promote their goals and objectives through quality productions that locals can actually afford to come and see.</p>
<p>       In the last year we have produced or co-produced some of the most exciting local theatre in the Valley with our own entertainingly innovative approach. Titles have included Sweeney Todd, Next to Normal, A Clockwork Orange, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Glass Menagerie, Godspell, as well as a number of original and avantegarde pieces for a fraction of what others charge. With your help, we will continue this tradition.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where It's Going</h2>
<p>       In the long run, your contributions will have a butterfly effect on the Vegas theatre community- they will help in more way than we can foresee or than you have time to read about. Nut the immediate benefits can be broken down into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Overall Production Value</li>
<li>Venue Improvements</li>
<li>Artist Incentives</li>
</ol><h3>Overall Production Value:</h3>
<p>       Producing a play or musical can get expensive. The rights alone can be thousands of dollars. This doesn't include the costs of acutally putting a show on stage. A portion of the money collected will go to acquiring stock resources, such as microphones, monitors, costume and set pieces, which can be altered and used for various productions. This eliminates some of the unnecessary expences of renting or purchasing items for each title in our season. As a result, we can keep ticket prices at an affordable rate.</p>
<h3>Venue Improvements:</h3>
<p>       The Onyx Theatre is such a unique space, in part, because it was built by hand in a building that was never inteded to be a theatre. This is what gives it the indie art house charm, reminiscent of those in Northeast theatre districts like New York and Philadelphia. But its location also presents some challenges. We have already begun making improvements including expanding wing space on one side, adding a larger second dressing room, upgradingsome lighting and sound equipment and creating a more welcoming lobby (complete with concessions). However, there are always improvements that can be made to enhance the theatre experience for both our patrons an dour artists. For starters, we will be replacing or repairing seats, creating more options for handicap access, expanding wing space on the other side, and continuing to keep our technical resources up to date. A portion of your contributions assist us in all of these efforts.</p>
<h3>Artist Incentives:</h3>
<p>        Las Vegas is incredibly rich with talented artists. Because of the quality and originality of our productions, we are often able to entice highly skilled performers and designers to join our team. But no one expects to make a living doing community theatre; thus, a majority of these exceptional folks earn their income through full-time employment. They make sacrifices for their art and for the sake of lacal theatre goers by taking time off of work or turning down higher paying gigs to be a part of a project that they believe in.</p>
<p>        At Off-Strip Productions, we want to be able to reward them for their sacrifices and for lending us their talents. A stipend, no matter how small, is always appreciated becuse it shows that we appreciate them. Your generous gifts will allow us to continue drawing these remarkable artists to projects like ours, thereby raising the bar for local theatre thoughout the Valley.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>It's Not Really Altruism</h2>
<p>        No, we don't expect you to give for nothing. In addition to good Karma and a fuzzy feeling of benevolence, you will recieve a variety of valuable perks. These will include tickets or season passes, concession, memorabilia or even having your name enshrined on our ""Wall of Thanks"" in the theatre lobby.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>It Always Comes Back</h2>
<p>        The bottom line is everything you donate will come back to benefit you- our loyal patrons and fellow community members. By supporting what we do at Off-Strip Productions you are supporting the idea of local theatre everywhere. We want to work with you to set the standards for artistic opportunity and affordable entertainment. And who knows...on day in the not-so-distant future, one of our own may get up on that stage to accept their Tony and thank those that made it possible for them right here in Las Vegas- proving to the world once and for all that we do, in fact, have culture. But even if they don't, it'll still be true, thanks to you!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other Ways To Help</h2>

       Did you watch the Tony's this year? Ever wonder where those brilliant artists and entertainers come from? Most of them began their careers in healthy theatre communitites with local organizations that allowed them to not only find their passion for performing, writing or designing, but also gave them a chance to actually practice it. Here at Off-Strip Productions, we belive talent is cultivated through diverse experience and that's what we offer to artists in Las Vegas.
       Off-Strip Productions is a non-profit (501(c)(3)) organization that makes its home inside the charmingly intimate Onyx Theatre. Our mission is to encourage cultural accessibility and growth by collaborating with our arts community to provide first class, affordable entertainment with an innovative, in-your-face style taht you cannot get anywhere else in the Valley. From classic Broadway musicals to original, home-grown, works, we actively support opportunities for local artists through a teamwork approach to the creation of live theatre.
       Your contributions are essential to making this mission possible, thereby granting opportunities to local actors, directors, designers, musicians and more to exercise their crafts and gain the necessary experience not found in books or classrooms.
       Also by suporting us you are strengthening an entire community. In addition to the individual artists, we have and continue to partner with many local organizations that are similar to Off-Strip, but who have no home of their own companies like Poor Richard's Players, Table 8 Productions, Huntsman Entertainment, Rag Tag Entertainment, Sin City Opera and more.
       These are just a handful of the groups that share our vision for the Vegas tehatre scene. We work with them, providing a venue and whatever resources we can to promote their goals and objectives through quality productions that locals can actually afford to come and see.
       In the last year we have produced or co-produced some of the most exciting local theatre in the Valley with our own entertainingly innovative approach. Titles have included Sweeney Todd, Next to Normal, A Clockwork Orange, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Glass Menagerie, Godspell, as well as a number of original and avantegarde pieces for a fraction of what others charge. With your help, we will continue this tradition.
 
Where It's Going
       In the long run, your contributions will have a butterfly effect on the Vegas theatre community- they will help in more way than we can foresee or than you have time to read about. Nut the immediate benefits can be broken down into three categories:

Overall Production Value
Venue Improvements
Artist Incentives
Overall Production Value:
       Producing a play or musical can get expensive. The rights alone can be thousands of dollars. This doesn't include the costs of acutally putting a show on stage. A portion of the money collected will go to acquiring stock resources, such as microphones, monitors, costume and set pieces, which can be altered and used for various productions. This eliminates some of the unnecessary expences of renting or purchasing items for each title in our season. As a result, we can keep ticket prices at an affordable rate.
Venue Improvements:
       The Onyx Theatre is such a unique space, in part, because it was built by hand in a building that was never inteded to be a theatre. This is what gives it the indie art house charm, reminiscent of those in Northeast theatre districts like New York and Philadelphia. But its location also presents some challenges. We have already begun making improvements including expanding wing space on one side, adding a larger second dressing room, upgradingsome lighting and sound equipment and creating a more welcoming lobby (complete with concessions). However, there are always improvements that can be made to enhance the theatre experience for both our patrons an dour artists. For starters, we will be replacing or repairing seats, creating more options for handicap access, expanding wing space on the other side, and continuing to keep our technical resources up to date. A portion of your contributions assist us in all of these efforts.
Artist Incentives:
        Las Vegas is incredibly rich with talented artists. Because of the quality and originality of our productions, we are often able to entice highly skilled performers and designers to join our team. But no one expects to make a living doing community theatre; thus, a majority of these exceptional folks earn their income through full-time employment. They make sacrifices for their art and for the sake of lacal theatre goers by taking time off of work or turning down higher paying gigs to be a part of a project that they believe in.
        At Off-Strip Productions, we want to be able to reward them for their sacrifices and for lending us their talents. A stipend, no matter how small, is always appreciated becuse it shows that we appreciate them. Your generous gifts will allow us to continue drawing these remarkable artists to projects like ours, thereby raising the bar for local theatre thoughout the Valley.
 
It's Not Really Altruism
        No, we don't expect you to give for nothing. In addition to good Karma and a fuzzy feeling of benevolence, you will recieve a variety of valuable perks. These will include tickets or season passes, concession, memorabilia or even having your name enshrined on our ""Wall of Thanks"" in the theatre lobby.
 
It Always Comes Back
        The bottom line is everything you donate will come back to benefit you- our loyal patrons and fellow community members. By supporting what we do at Off-Strip Productions you are supporting the idea of local theatre everywhere. We want to work with you to set the standards for artistic opportunity and affordable entertainment. And who knows...on day in the not-so-distant future, one of our own may get up on that stage to accept their Tony and thank those that made it possible for them right here in Las Vegas- proving to the world once and for all that we do, in fact, have culture. But even if they don't, it'll still be true, thanks to you!

Danny is the guy that other actors watch and think, 'Why the hell have I not heard of this guy before?' If you know him, you know what we're talking about, and if you don't, you'll soon find out.<br/><br/>Sometimes a great actor has a great notion. Eugene O'Neill's ""Hughie,"" a portrait of a man named Erie Smith struggling to survive his run of bad luck, has been whispering to Danny for years. Six months ago, he finally secured the rights to produce ""Hughie"" for three weeks in New York City. To complement O'Neill's one act play, Danny chose Susan Glaspell's ""Trifles."" Glaspell, a Pulitzer Prize-winner in her own right, helped launch O’Neill’s career in the summer of 1916 when he visited the Provincetown Players in Provincetown, Massachusetts. It was an auspicious summer for Glaspell, during which she both wrote and performed in “Trifles” and organized the very first reading of a Eugene O’Neill play. Their close personal and professional relationship over the ensuing years led to some of the greatest writing in the history of the American theatre.<br/><br/>With two great plays in hand, Danny assembled a group of actors, a director, and designers to bring O'Neill's and Glaspell's characters off the page and into living, breathing life.  </span></p><p></p><p></p>

Daniel O'Shea is a prolific actor who has been gracing stages and screens for over two decades. Danny is the guy that other actors watch and think, 'Why the hell have I not heard of this guy before?' If you know him, you know what we're talking about, and if you don't, you'll soon find out.Sometimes a great actor has a great notion. Eugene O'Neill's ""Hughie,"" a portrait of a man named Erie Smith struggling to survive his run of bad luck, has been whispering to Danny for years. Six months ago, he finally secured the rights to produce ""Hughie"" for three weeks in New York City. To complement O'Neill's one act play, Danny chose Susan Glaspell's ""Trifles."" Glaspell, a Pulitzer Prize-winner in her own right, helped launch O’Neill’s career in the summer of 1916 when he visited the Provincetown Players in Provincetown, Massachusetts. It was an auspicious summer for Glaspell, during which she both wrote and performed in “Trifles” and organized the very first reading of a Eugene O’Neill play. Their close personal and professional relationship over the ensuing years led to some of the greatest writing in the history of the American theatre.With two great plays in hand, Danny assembled a group of actors, a director, and designers to bring O'Neill's and Glaspell's characters off the page and into living, breathing life.  
 
The Impact
 
Danny had the good fortune to be visited by an angel, Mary C Healey, with whose support we secured a theatre space (the biggest expense in NYC!). Now our task turns to building the world of these two plays.
 
By donating any amount of money today, you will help us transform our small stage into the two lonely worlds these plays inhabit: a seedy New York City hotel, and a dilapidated mid-west farmhouse. Theatre is a collaborative art, created by a community of artists and audience members together. We're asking you to join that community today--help us build the world you'll be able to see when we open on November 3rd!
 
What We Need & What You Get
 
We need to raise the final $4,000 to bring these plays to life. Any amount you can give helps us reach that goal.  

For $20 you get a ticket to a performance of your choice and a thank you in our program!  If you are unable to make the show, your ticket will be donated in your name to a starving theatre-lover.
For $50 you get two tickets to a performance of your choice, a program mention, and a program signed by the cast!  We're not famous ... yet.

GraveYard Shift was founded from the ground up and runs out of the pockets of the individuals involved, we strive to create a quality product and put our faith in the community for their continued support. Donations of any size, from $5 to $500, help keep us going and assure that we can continue to create work for the growing theatre community, as well as providing entertainment for our captive audiences.</p>
<p>By supporting our show you will show that you care about the local theatre community, and that you have helped foster the development of emerging artists who strive endlessly to make a career in the arts.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With two successful shows already under our belt we feel confident in the support of the local community. GraveYard Shift grew out of the artist training programs offered locally at Memorial and Grenfell, and continues to maintain a great relationship with them both. The development of the community and the skillsets of our emerging artists is crucial to our mandate and beliefs, and we would not be asking for the support of our community if we did not fully believe we were doing something for their benefit.

<p><strong>What's this all about?</strong></p>
<p>We are the <em>CNY Shakespeare Festival</em>. A few friends who met at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York decided to start a <em>pay-what-you-can</em> theatre company so that everyone could afford to see the art form they love so much. We began last summer and received wonderful acclaim for our production of <em>Henry Vx7</em>.</p>
<p>This economy is tough on a lot of people.  We believe that the theatre should enlighten and change audiences. We also believe theatre should be available to all, not just a privileged few. Your contribution will provide theatre to everyone around you.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>For our summer season we need to raise $2,000 more. That money goes to hire actors, directors, and designers, and to pay for props, costumes, and space rentals, lawyers, accountants, and advertising legal fees to obtain our not-for-profit status. Designers alone will cost about $1100 for both shows. Sets will cost $600. The 501c3 filing fee is $800.00 plus a lawyer fee which will be just under $1000. Royalties will cost us $600.00 dollars. You may noticed that we haven't listed everything and we have already hit our $2,000 mark. Collaboration is key in the theatre. Writers, directors, designer, actors, the stage crew and many others are required for a great production. Your donation will help to instill that greatness!</p>
<p> We have some great perks for different levels of donations - check out the buttons to the right!</p>
<p>Should we not reach our goal of $2,000, the monies gathered will still help offset our overhead costs. </p>
<p> <strong>What’s the Catch? </strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p><em>There's really no catch</em>. We're entirely pay-what-you-can. We want to compensate all of our artists for their hard work and dedication. For nine months we search for funding to put on the best show possible. Then for thee months, we get to do what we love!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We are always looking for in-kind donations for our fundraising events. Silent auction items are a huge help.</p>
<p>As we continue to grow we're looking for a permanent place to call our home. We hope to host another Indiegogo capital campaign for our own building.  </p>

<p><em><span class=""notranlsate"">English version follows</span></em></p>
<h3><span class=""notranlsate"">Pour la petite histoire, nous nous sommes rencontrés Marc-André Bourgault et moi, Sharon Ibgui, à l’Option théâtre du Cégep Lionel-Groulx. Ce qui nous a toujours intéressé au théâtre c’est le non-dit, le bouillonnement intérieur qui transparaît au travers d’un souffle, toutes ces catastrophes miniatures qui nous habitent et dont nous sommes seul témoin. Quelques années plus tard, Marc-André m' a approché pour fonder une compagnie de théâtre avec lui. Sommes-nous fait pour créer ensemble? Est-ce que j ai envie de m'embarquer dans toutes ces paperasseries? D'assumer tous les risques financiers inhérents à un tel projet? Eh bien oui! L'envie de créer est plus forte que la peur. Et je trouve en Marc-André un accolyte aux convictions communes. Les Défricheurs Théâtre voit le jour en mai 2011. </span></h3>
<h3><span class=""notranlsate"">Marc-André décide alors d'orchestrer le premier projet. Un projet qui a pour prémisse les blocages que nous ressentons dans notre corps suite à des évènements marquants, des blessures de la vie. S'en suive quelques laboratoires où l'histoire de Marc-André s'impose comme une évidence. Marc-André a été violé à l'âge de 5 ans par son père et a paralysé pendant plusieurs mois à l'âge de 13 ans... Les échos dans son corps sont évidents. Ayant entrepris un travail sur lui depuis déjà quelques années, (Dévoilé) se présente comme une oeuvre salvatrice lui permettant à chaque étape de la création de se libérer de ce lourd passé. </span></h3>
<h3><span class=""notranlsate"">Je vous rassure, nous ne sommes pas dans le théâtre de l'apitoiement mais dans celui de la résilience. Comment devient-on un homme libre suite à ce genre d'évènement? C'est ce que mon ami Marc-André réussit quotidiennement et c'est avec un immense plaisir que je le vois créer après l'horreur. Marc-André dit souvent que l'art lui a sauvé la vie. Et bien maintenant, c'est à son tour de créer. (Dévoilé) est une ode à la lumière, à la liberté, un lieu où le cynisme n'a pas sa place. Le pardon, l'Amour, la foi en quelque chose de plus grand que l'hommerie, voilà où (Dévoilé) nous mène. </span></h3>
<h3><span class=""notranlsate"">Nous savons qu'il y a des tonnes de causes, mais nous pensons fermement que l 'art peut faire une différence. Le viol est ici un prétexte. Notre but est de chercher avec vous comment nous pouvons fleurir malgré l'horreur? Comment devenir les héros de nos vies ? </span></h3>
<h3><span class=""notranlsate"">Nous sommes une nouvelle compagnie qui a la chance de pouvoir se produire à La Chapelle du 5 au 16 mars 2013. Notre propos a su les interpeller et nous en sommes très fiers! Maintenant comment financer un tel projet? Aurons-nous des subventions gouvernementales et autres ? Nous n'en savons rien mais nous savons que tout ceci représente bien des sous! C'est là où nous espérons avoir votre support! Peu importe le montant, si notre propos peut vous toucher. En espérant que vous serez nombreux! Merci d'avance, chers amis ! Et n’hésitez pas à partager cette page parmi vos réseaux!</span></h3>

<h2><span class=""notranlsate""><strong>(UNVEILED)</strong></span></h2>
</li>
</ul><h3><span class=""notranlsate"">To make a long story short, Marc-André Bourgault and I, Sharon Ibgui, met at Cegep Lionel-Groulx, Theater option. What has always made theater interesting to us is the unspoken, the inside bubbling that shines through in one breath, these miniature disasters that live in each of us and for which we are the only witness. A few years later, Marc-André approached me with the idea of starting a theater company together. Do we have what it takes to create together? Is all the required paperwork what I really want to get into? To assume all the financial risks inherent to such a project? Well, yes! The desire to create is stronger than fear. And I found in Marc-André a partner that shares common beliefs. Les Défricheurs Théâtre was founded in May 2011. </span></h3>
<h3><span class=""notranlsate"">Marc-André decides to orchestrate the first project. A project based on the premise that significant events, injuries of life leave blockages in our body. Ensues a few laboratories where the story of Marc-André becomes self-evident. Marc-André was raped by his father at the age of 5 and paralyzed for several months at the age of 13 ... Echoes in his body are evident. Having started to work on himself a few years ago (Unveiled) is presented as a liberation act allowing him, with every step of the creation, to free himself from the heavy weight of his past. </span></h3>

English version follows
Pour la petite histoire, nous nous sommes rencontrés Marc-André Bourgault et moi, Sharon Ibgui, à l’Option théâtre du Cégep Lionel-Groulx. Ce qui nous a toujours intéressé au théâtre c’est le non-dit, le bouillonnement intérieur qui transparaît au travers d’un souffle, toutes ces catastrophes miniatures qui nous habitent et dont nous sommes seul témoin. Quelques années plus tard, Marc-André m' a approché pour fonder une compagnie de théâtre avec lui. Sommes-nous fait pour créer ensemble? Est-ce que j ai envie de m'embarquer dans toutes ces paperasseries? D'assumer tous les risques financiers inhérents à un tel projet? Eh bien oui! L'envie de créer est plus forte que la peur. Et je trouve en Marc-André un accolyte aux convictions communes. Les Défricheurs Théâtre voit le jour en mai 2011. 
Marc-André décide alors d'orchestrer le premier projet. Un projet qui a pour prémisse les blocages que nous ressentons dans notre corps suite à des évènements marquants, des blessures de la vie. S'en suive quelques laboratoires où l'histoire de Marc-André s'impose comme une évidence. Marc-André a été violé à l'âge de 5 ans par son père et a paralysé pendant plusieurs mois à l'âge de 13 ans... Les échos dans son corps sont évidents. Ayant entrepris un travail sur lui depuis déjà quelques années, (Dévoilé) se présente comme une oeuvre salvatrice lui permettant à chaque étape de la création de se libérer de ce lourd passé. 
Je vous rassure, nous ne sommes pas dans le théâtre de l'apitoiement mais dans celui de la résilience. Comment devient-on un homme libre suite à ce genre d'évènement? C'est ce que mon ami Marc-André réussit quotidiennement et c'est avec un immense plaisir que je le vois créer après l'horreur. Marc-André dit souvent que l'art lui a sauvé la vie. Et bien maintenant, c'est à son tour de créer. (Dévoilé) est une ode à la lumière, à la liberté, un lieu où le cynisme n'a pas sa place. Le pardon, l'Amour, la foi en quelque chose de plus grand que l'hommerie, voilà où (Dévoilé) nous mène. 
Nous savons qu'il y a des tonnes de causes, mais nous pensons fermement que l 'art peut faire une différence. Le viol est ici un prétexte. Notre but est de chercher avec vous comment nous pouvons fleurir malgré l'horreur? Comment devenir les héros de nos vies ? 
Nous sommes une nouvelle compagnie qui a la chance de pouvoir se produire à La Chapelle du 5 au 16 mars 2013. Notre propos a su les interpeller et nous en sommes très fiers! Maintenant comment financer un tel projet? Aurons-nous des subventions gouvernementales et autres ? Nous n'en savons rien mais nous savons que tout ceci représente bien des sous! C'est là où nous espérons avoir votre support! Peu importe le montant, si notre propos peut vous toucher. En espérant que vous serez nombreux! Merci d'avance, chers amis ! Et n’hésitez pas à partager cette page parmi vos réseaux!

(UNVEILED)

To make a long story short, Marc-André Bourgault and I, Sharon Ibgui, met at Cegep Lionel-Groulx, Theater option. What has always made theater interesting to us is the unspoken, the inside bubbling that shines through in one breath, these miniature disasters that live in each of us and for which we are the only witness. A few years later, Marc-André approached me with the idea of starting a theater company together. Do we have what it takes to create together? Is all the required paperwork what I really want to get into? To assume all the financial risks inherent to such a project? Well, yes! The desire to create is stronger than fear. And I found in Marc-André a partner that shares common beliefs. Les Défricheurs Théâtre was founded in May 2011. 
Marc-André decides to orchestrate the first project. A project based on the premise that significant events, injuries of life leave blockages in our body. Ensues a few laboratories where the story of Marc-André becomes self-evident. Marc-André was raped by his father at the age of 5 and paralyzed for several months at the age of 13 ... Echoes in his body are evident. Having started to work on himself a few years ago (Unveiled) is presented as a liberation act allowing him, with every step of the creation, to free himself from the heavy weight of his past. 
Rest assured, we are not in theater of pity but in one of resilience. How do you become a free man after this kind of event? This is what my friend Marc-André manages daily and it is with great pleasure that I see him create after the horror. Marc-André often says that art saved his life. Well, now it is his turn to create. (Unveiled) is an ode to light, freedom, a place where cynicism has no place. Forgiveness, Love, faith in something bigger than baseness, that is where (Unveiled) leads. 
We know there are tons of causes, but we firmly believe that art can make a difference. Rape here is a pretext. Our goal is to uncover with you how we can flourish despite the horror? How to become the heroes of our lives? 
We are a new company that has the opportunity to perform at La Chapelle from March 5th to March 16th, 2013. Our discourse talked to them and we are very proud of it! Now, how to finance such a project? Will we obtain government subsidies or others? We do not know but we know that all of this represents a lot of money! This is where we hope to have your support! Regardless of the amount, we are hoping that many of you will be touched by our purpose! Thank you in advance, dear friends! And do not hesitate to share this page through your networks!

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>“A Fierce Longing” rocked my world when I first saw it for a variety of reasons. A strong ensemble cast, mind-boggling visuals, a fascinating central character from an unfamiliar culture, and an exploration of themes of beauty, sexuality, and death all contributed to an unforgettable piece of theater. I’m reviving this play to pay tribute to one of the peak theatrical experiences of my life, and to honor the exceptionally rich history of work presented at Theatre Project over its 40-year history.</p>
<p>The play's seamless integration of biography and poetry, ensemble theater and projections felt groundbreaking/unique/surreal/sensuous at the time. I'm challenged and excited in the opportunity and freedom available through new technologies, as well as traditional techniques, to again explore the play's ever intriguing subject, Yukio Mishima.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>WHO ARE “WE”?</strong></p>
<p>“We” starts with me. I’m John Wilson, the producer/director of “A Fierce Longing.” When I was asked to direct something for Baltimore Theatre Project’s 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary season I immediately thought of this play, which I saw there in 1978. Milwaukee’s Theatre X brought a stunning multi-media production of their original play to Baltimore and New York (where it played at the Performance Garage and later won an Obie Award).</p>
<p>“We” holds Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima at the core of the project. “A Fierce Longing” chronicles his life, his work, and his turmoil. A complex man, Mishima struggled with family issues, wrestled with a St. Sebastian fetish and homosexual desires, sought fame and celebrity for his Nobel-nominated writing, and desired to honor the Emperor and the Samurai tradition through his ultra-conservative political views and formation of a militia. Ultimately, he committed seppuku, ritual suicide, in 1970.</p>
<p>“We” includes playwright John Schneider. He is thrilled that we are presenting a new production of his play.</p>
<p>The “We” continues with Anne Cantler Fulwiler, producing director of Theatre Project, and the theatre’s talented staff. And the “We” includes an amazing production team including a Japanese No theater scholar, the premiere sword and weapons coach in the region, a brilliant young lighting designer, a composer of national renown, and an awesome costumer who worked for many years at Arena Stage.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>WHY DO WE NEED THE MONEY?</strong></p>
<p>To paraphrase Sondheim, “Art isn’t easy” – nor is it cheap. To pull off all the technical aspects of the show, we need your support. To compensate the talented production team, we need your support. To secure the wisdom of our Japanese cultural consultant, we need your support. And to fly in and house the playwright to tap into his brilliant mind and depth of experience, we need your support.</p>
<p>In fall of 2011 I launched a traditional direct mail campaign to raise funds for this production. That campaign did very well and raised about $6000. Now, for phase II, I’m putting my faith in this online campaign with a goal of $3000. Help me prove that this can be successful.</p>
<p>I am passionate about this project and excited to begin rehearsals. Reaching our goal by April 30 will allow me to give my total attention to the cast and rehearsal process rather than fundraising. After all, this is about the art! </p>
<p><em>Consider, please, an apple. The inside is invisible. There, at the heart, shut up within the flesh, the core trembles in darkness. It knows it exists, but the knowledge is not enough. It wants to see. For the core of the apple, the only sure proof of existence is to see itself. There is a solution. It's for a knife to come plunging into the apple, splitting it open, exposing the core to the same light as the surface. Thus...the core of the apple sacrifices existence for one perfect moment of sight. Oh, the fierce longing simply to see without words! Oh, for the knife to cut through my flesh and my shattered senses close that impossible gap!</em></p>

is proud to announce the world premiere of: 

Linthead 
By Brian Forrester
Directed by Max Montel

May 11 - June 3
Santa Monica Playhouse 
Main Stage, A Guest Production




During the chaos of the General Textile Strike of 1934, in a world of fire-and- brimstone sermons, front porch sing-alongs, hoochie- coochie girls, and lungs full of cotton dust, Linthead is the story of a South Carolina cotton mill worker who hurts everyone he loves when he stands up for his rights.  

With America in crisis, mounting economic disparity, and families losing their homes as jobs become obsolete and hard to find, the 1930's may be a distant shadow of history, but Linthead could not be a more immediate and necessary play. An intensely original and uniquely theatrical piece, it deals strongly with the mythology of heroes and the family stories we fiercely protect.


The Artists

The Artery Playwrights Project is a non-profit theatre arts collective dedicated to the production of new American plays. Playwright Brian Forrester is grateful to have Director Max Montel and Producer Candace Brekka leading a talented creative team that includes Designer Meg Cunningham, Music Director Tommy Bourgeois and Stage Manager Kelli Sinclair, along with our cast of brilliant actors and musicians: 
Amanda Jane Cooper

Patrick Dillon Curry 
Michael Dempsey
Tristan Farmer 

Kristi Israel 

Eddie King 

Sara Lindsey 
Nick Marcucci

We Need Your Help

Every one of these volunteer artists is thrilled to be part of bringing this powerful new play to the American stage, but they can't do it without your help. Creating theatre is a major undertaking that requires enormous skill and resources. 

With your support, we can cover many of the immense costs associated with a production of this magnitude.  For example:

Your $25 donation will cover the cost of painting one of our sets.
Your $50 donation will pay for constructing one costume.
Your $100 donation will get us a rehearsal room for one evening.
Your $500 donation will rent a theatre for one performance. 


Consider Making A Contribution

Please consider making a contribution in any amount to our Indie GoGo campaign. Donations are tax deductible and all proceeds go toward making this exciting production of a new American play possible.  We only have a limited amount of time to fund this production, so please don't wait to contribute. Every little bit counts.

Thank you very much. We hope to see you at the theatre.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</ul><p><strong>ABOUT <em>DIRTY LAUNDRY (CYCLE 1)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>We need a place to do our <em>Dirty Laundry</em>!</strong><br/><br/>The Collaboratory and Inkblot Ensemble need your help to bring the first phase of our collaboratively devised physical theatre piece, <em>Dirty Laundry</em>, to the EXIT Theatre in August 2012. Your generous contributions will help us pay for rehearsal space, a performance venue, and production materials ranging from postcards to costumes.<br/><br/><em>Dirty Laundry</em> is a play about the things we wish we could hide; explored through text, song, movement, and laundry. Inspired by the laundress scene from Spanish playwright Federico García Lorca’s play, <em>Yerma</em>, the piece delves into the darkness and the dirtiness, but also the sexiness and sweetness that can be revealed when we think no one is looking.  Viewed through the lens of the intensely personal act of washing someone’s clothes, <em>Dirty Laundry</em> probes into the literal and metaphorical dirt of daily living.  How do we hide secrets and how are they revealed? What is said and what is left unsaid? Not everything will come out in the wash, but what does is shocking.<br/><br/>Six actresses: (Hannah Gaff, Emlyn Guiney, Maria Leigh, Marilet Martinez, Erin Maxon, and Liz Wand) and Director Amy Clare Tasker will work collaboratively to explore these themes, joining poetic language with rhythmic physicality and domestic work songs. In this short piece, the laundresses, only peripheral characters in <em>Yerma</em>, will take center stage and begin to speak - through Lorca’s words, through new text, through movement, and through song.  From what Lorca called “a tragic poem in three acts” springs a night filled with dirty secrets, coming clean, and some things that are wrecked beyond repair.  <br/><br/><strong>Why this project is unique:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an all female production - both on and off stage.  In addition to the collaborators mentioned above we will be working with dramaturg Caroline Parsons and stage manager Diann Michele Leo.</li>
<li>It is a new work collaboratively devised by the ensemble and the director.</li>
<li>It will unite adventurous physicality with rigorous textwork and song.</li>
</ul><p><br/><strong>Where your contributions will go:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Six weeks of rehearsal space</li>
<li>Two nights of performance rental at San Francisco’s EXIT Theatre.</li>
<li>Minimal props and costumes</li>
<li>Minimal publicity materials</li>
<li>Any additional funds will support the future development and production of <em>Dirty Laundry </em>
</li>
</ul><p>All of us working on the production of <em>Dirty Laundry</em> want to say thank you.  <strong>Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!</strong>  Yes, <em>you</em> the incredible people who have donated and those of you who are reading this and are considering donating.  We have been floored by your generosity, both in terms of your donations and in terms of your support of this work.  Thank you for telling us how much <strong>this piece means to you and how excited you are to see it in August.  Because of you, because of your support, because of your love,  because we want to share this first cycle with all of you, we’re adding a third night: Thursday August 9th.</strong>  And because it’s FREE - it’s our gift to you.  (We’ve been so excited along the way that we forgot to say that before, but yes, the show is free.)</p>
<p><br/>But wait, there’s more, a lot more, a load more.  We’ve been amazed by you, our community, who clearly want to see this work made, made well, and made sooner rather than later.  <strong>We feel inspired by you, inspired by the creative team that has drawn together to make this work, inspired by the stories you are sharing, inspired by the research we are doing, and inspired by the hunger for this work to happen now. </strong></p>
<p>We knew that the August showing would be the start of a longer piece, that 25 minutes was not enough to explore everything we wanted to, but we thought we would have to wait at least a year to start working on a full production. <strong>We will make the first cycle in August and then we’re committing to making a full production right away.</strong>  We’re clearing our schedules starting in October, we’re looking for a venue, and we’re saying yes!<br/><br/><em>Dirty Laundry</em> is something special.  It has an electric energy, a life of its own.  It went from a few of us sharing a copy of<em> Yerma.</em> <strong>Every dollar you give us from now until the end of the campaign will go directly into a full production of <em>Dirty Laundry</em> beginning rehearsals this fall.</strong>  We underestimated ourselves, we underestimated you - we won’t make that mistake again.  Your contributions will help determine the scope and scale of our full production and we know that it is going to be an incredible adventure.  Thank you for all you have given and thank you for what is yet to come.</p>

<p><strong>Una producción de Ariana Sacristán</strong></p>
<p><i>Women that love each other, seeking desperately for a child. Mothers with children, desperately seeking to assure their happiness.  Disoriented children, desperate to find their place. Stories of people finding their path in life. And love that permeates everything, that allows everything, the good and the bad.  </i></p>
<p>I first encountered “El Viento en un Violín”, written by the Argentinian playwright Claudio Tolcachir, at the Cervantino Festival in 2013 and it was love at first sight! I had just spent the last 90 minutes wishing I had brought a diaper so that I didn’t have to worry about peeing my pants from laughing so hard. However, I felt very conflicted. Why had I laughed so much? The stories that I had just witnessed had been dark, twisted and deeply moving and yet the comedy never left the play. How was it possible to feel so many opposing emotions at the same time? I spent hours with my friends after the show trying to unpack everything we had just experienced and we found ourselves in deep discussion over the issues of gender, sexuality and class that had been so beautifully embedded in the storytelling of the show. I couldn't believe that a play could create such a productive dialogue on these complex issues. </p>
<p>Fast forward six years and I find myself wanting to produce a play. But not any play. I want a play that forces the audience to reflect because I believe that theatre should have value beyond entertainment. I want a comedy because I firmly believe that comedy has the power to penetrate the audience in a way that tragedy can’t. And finally, I want a Latin American play, because I am fed up of going to the theatre in Mexico City and seeing only translations of American plays that do not speak to the realities we face. In my search for a play that fit all these requirements, I think of “El Viento en un Violín” that in all these years has refused to leave my mind. It’s perfect! </p>
<p>I immediately embarked on a journey to acquire the rights and get a team together. I am now happy to announce that I have both. Now, all we need is the funding to get this play on its feet and be able to do a 12 performance run in 2020! </p>

<p><i>Mujeres que se aman, buscando desesperadamente  un hijo. Madres con hijos, desesperadas por asegurarles la felicidad. Hijos desorientados, desesperados por encontrar su lugar. Historias de seres buscándose la vida. Y el amor que lo atraviesa todo, que todo lo permite, lo bueno y lo malo.</i></p>
<p>Mi primer encuentro con la obra de teatro “El Viento en un Violín” del dramaturgo argentino Claudio Tolcachir fue en el Festival Cervantino en el 2013 y fue amor a primera vista. Me pasé los 90 minutos de la obra deseando que tuviera puesto un pañal para no tenerme que preocupar de hacerme pipí de la risa. Sin embargo, me sentía muy conflictuada. ¿Por qué me reí tanto? Las historias que acababa de presenciar eran obscuras, torcidas y conmovedoras, pero la comedia no dejó ningún momento la obra. ¿Cómo era posible sentir tantas emociones contradictorias al mismo tiempo? Pasé horas con mis amigos después de la obra intentando desenvolver lo que acabamos de ver y terminamos en una discusión profunda sobre los temas del género, la sexualidad y las clases sociales que habían sido tan bellamente cosidos a la narrativa de la obra. Estaba muy sorprendida de que una obra de teatro pudiera crear un diálogo tan productivo sobre estos temas complejos. </p>
<p>Saltamos 6 años y me encuentro con el deseo de producir una obra de teatro. Pero no cualquier obra de teatro.  Yo quiero una obra que fuerce al público a reflexionar, porque creo que el teatro va más allá de sólo entretener. Yo quiero una comedia porque yo creo firmemente que la comedia tiene el poder de penetrar al público de una forma que la tragedia no puede. Yo quiero un obra Latinoamericana, porque estoy cansada de ir al teatro en la CDMX y solo ver traducciones de obras Estadounidenses que no hablan de la realidades que enfrentamos en México. En mi búsqueda por una obra que cumpla todos mis requerimientos, pienso en “El Viento en un Violín”, aquella obra que se rehusó a salir de mi cabeza durante todos estos años. ¡Es perfecta!</p>
<p>Inmediatamente embarqué en una aventura para conseguir los derechos de autor y armar un equipo. Estoy muy emocionada de anunciar que ya tengo ambos. ¡Ahora solo necesitamos financiamiento para montar esta obra y dar 12 presentaciones en el 2020!</p>

<p>Mexico is living through a time of social change that, for the first time, has opened up a dialogue about the classicism, racism, sexism and homophobia that permeate our society. This play is our way of contributing to the conversation. Fist of all, we are excited to perform a play that shows lesbianism, which is extremely underrepresented in the performing arts and present it without the fetishism that so often accompanies it.  Also, we are going to adapt this play to a Mexican context so that we can speak directly to the way that these issues manifest themselves in Mexico, allowing the audience to identify themselves and therefore forcing them to reflect. If we are successful, we hope the audience will feel compelled to continue the conversation outside of the theatre, the same way I did when I first saw this show. </p>

<p>En México estamos viviendo una época de cambio social que, por primera vez, ha abierto la conversación del clasismo, racismo, sexismo y homofobia que contamina a nuestra sociedad. Esta obra es nuestra forma de contribuir a la conversación.  Nos emociona presentar una obra que enseñe lesbianismo, que pocas veces se ve representando en las artes escénicas, sin el fetichismo que tan comúnmente lo acompaña. También, queremos adaptar esta obra a un contexto mexicano para que podemos evidenciar directamente las formas en que estos temas se manifiestan en México, logrando así que el público se identifique y sea vea forzado a reflexionar. Si tenemos éxito en esto, esperamos que el público sienta la necesidad de seguir con la conversación afuera del teatro, de la misma manera que yo me sentí cuando vi esta obra por primera vez.</p>

<h3>What is ReAct Theatre?</h3>
<p>Artistic Director,<strong> David Hsieh, started <a href=""http://www.reacttheatre.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ReAct Theatre</a> 25 years ago</strong> and continues to produce theatre in the NW. He picks the perfect venue for each show he puts in his seasons. <strong>SALTY will open August 1st at the lovely <a href=""http://www.12avearts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">12th Ave Arts</a></strong> space on Capital Hill.</p>
<p>""ReAct strives to explore the diversity of our community and produce innovative, quality theatrical entertainment through multi-ethnic and non-traditional casting"" ~David Hsieh</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why SALTY?</h3>
<p>""A dear friend of mine was in the world premiere of SALTY in New York. I caught the show and I fell in love with it, and<strong> I knew I had to bring SALTY to Seattle</strong>"" ~ David Hsieh </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What made you write SALTY?</h3>
<p>We are thrilled that playwright, AJ Clauss, will be joining us for rehearsals and opening night of SALTY in Seattle. I recently asked AJ, what inspired you to write SALTY?</p>
<p>""Several years ago I ‘d heard about <strong>two male penguins that fell in love at a zoo</strong> and had never really heard of something like that happen before. More than their story, I was fixated on two circumstances around it: the media coverage, and the gender identity of penguins. In 2016, Kevin Matthews wrote an article on how <strong>gender roles were killing the crested penguin. The rules they have placed on themselves, on the female and male gender, are slowly killing them. I think this was my way in to the play.""</strong></p>
<p>""I grew up in small-town, Indiana and am working through my own traumas as a queer person from the midwest every day. In high school, when things were looking a little rough for me, <strong>my best friend got me a job at the Louisville Zoo, playing the Tin Man</strong>, every Thursday through Sunday, talking to kids, showing off my new heart... So many of my co-workers were queer and I grew so much in such a short span of time. The first man I ever kissed was the actor playing Superman at the zoo. And <strong>a couple years later, my friend who got me the job died rather tragically, he was the cowardly lion and the bravest person I knew. Some ten years later, I am writing a play set in a zoo, </strong>and I start seeing him in my dreams. It felt nice to reconnect with him, and now <strong>I understand what it means when my mentor says to write a play for the dead.""</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Art is Life and Life is Art</h3>
<p>""When I was working on this play, my hometown was underwater, California was on fire, and it was the deadliest hurricane season since 2005. <strong>Mother Nature started burning the edges of my play, and I realized, it was never my play, it's hers.</strong> <strong>She gives and she takes</strong> and I wanted to honor that. I wanted to showcase our privilege as humans on this planet, and try to appreciate life and Earth in a way that isn't berating on climate change, but is witness to it.""        ~ AJ Clauss</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do we need YOUR help?</h3>
<p>We have a mighty cast of 7 incredible artists who will bring this story to life. We have amazing designers who will take the show to the next level. David Hsieh, is getting posters designed, flyers for marketing, gathering props, creating wardrobe and so much more. <strong>This campaign will help pay these artists and all that goes into bringing POWERFUL theatre to the stage!</strong></p>
<p>""There are 14 characters in the play, 7 zookeepers, 7 penguins, and a fox--<strong> all intersecting and colliding their stories into one another-- and inevitably all pushing towards the same conclusion-- the same light. The actors double as animals and zookeepers and this is a really special part of the play, I think. To be the caretaker and the taken care of-- </strong>allows for 14 characters to seem more filled-in and wholesome that you could typically do in a 90-minute play because their storylines speak to one another. <strong>I think it’s a tasty experience to see both the beginning and the end at the same time."" </strong>~ AJ Clauss</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Rosin Box</h3>
<p>We are the professional ballerinas, and dancers of City Ballet of San Diego, and we are raising funds to put on our own performances during our off layoff from our September - May season, in Downtown San Diego this Summer 2018. </p>
<p>We are asking you and our community to help us raise the money to be able to perform three shows over the course of one weekend this summer. Three shows of brand new work, and never before seen ballets. These ballets will be choreographed - rehearsed - and performed, by none other than the dancers of City Ballet of San Diego themselves. </p>
<p>Please help us make these performances a reality!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to guarentee the performance venue and overall success of putting on these shows, we are hoping to raise $4000 for The Rosin Box project. This money will go towards renting the venue, transporting a proper floor for the dancers to perform on, sound and lighting technitions, costumes, pointe shoes, marketing, concessions, and compensation for various other necessities and personel that go into putting on a production. </p>
<p>For every pledge you make, The Rosin Box dancers want to extend a thank you:</p>
<p><strong>$25 or more-</strong></p>
<p>Postcard of 'The Rosin Box' to commemorate the show, signed by the dancers!</p>
<p><strong>$50 or more- </strong></p>
<p>Limited edition high resolution print from 'The Rosin Box' by Carly Topazio Photography.</p>
<p><strong>$100 or more-</strong></p>
<p>Can't make it to the shows? You can still support the dancers and see what was created! Receive a copy of the performances via a DVD mailed out one week following the performances.</p>
<p><strong>$200 or more-</strong></p>
<p>Get a signed pair of pointe shoes that helped keep one of these professional ballerinas on their toes!</p>
<p><strong>$300 or more-</strong></p>
<p>Have your business or company ad placed in our performance programs!</p>
<p><strong>$500 or more-</strong></p>
<p>Exclusive opportunity to sit in on ""The Rosin Box' dress rehearsal the night before opening night. Get an even more personal, and raw look at what goes into making.</p>
<p><strong>$1000 or more-</strong></p>
<p>Two tickets to one of City Ballet of San Diego's performances during their 2018/19 season</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone knows the term ""starving artists"". As ballerinas we don't make livable wages. It's a harsh reality, but true. The bare minimum is what we're use to. Unfortunate as it is, we pursue this artform still. </p>
<p>It is not greed, or the pursuit of success that drives us, but passion. We love what we do. We cannot live without what we do. We are ballerinas, and we would like to continue to share and communicate the art of dance as it is a necessarry component to that which we call life, not just for us, but for everyone.</p>
<p>As humans, we are all adept creatures genetically made up to feel and experience a wide range of emotions. Art, on every medium, is the one way in which we can translate, share, explain, discover, transcend, and explore those emotions. We NEED art, it is vital to us.... if we lacked this capacity of being infected by art, or even lacked art itself, people might be almost more savage still, and -above all- more separated from, and more hostile to, one another. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The major risk we face is not raising the necessary funds needed in time to be able to not only secure a performance venue, but to properly compensate the artists and individuals involved in making these shows a reality. <br/>If we do not raise enough to secure a venue, the unfortunate reality is that the performances will not take place. We will do everything in our power to see this does not happen, but we need the help our supporters to see this project through!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!</p>
<p>Help us get the word out and make some noise about fundraising for The Rosin Box! Remember that you can always use the Indiegogo share tools to share our campaign with others and on social media</p>

My goal is for the audience to walk away with a greater understanding of their own special place in this often confounding world and, regardless of their belief system, to celebrate the infinitesimal chance that we exist in the first place.

An experienced dramaturg, he spent two seasons directing new work at the Eugene O’Neill Theatre Center.  He wrote the book and lyrics for the successful musical The It Girl and is a BMI-Award winning lyricist.  Regionally, his production of West Side Story won the 2014 Moss Hart Award. Internationally, he won the Australian ""Tony"" (the Helpmann) for ""Best Direction"" and staged the European premiere of The Producers for Stage Entertainment.Dani Davis is currently engaged in the launch of Girl Starter - a nationally scaled for profit media company and incubator to build out businesses, campaigns, and movements created by teenage girls. Anchored by a seamless online community and a network unscripted reality television series - The Apprentice meets Shark Tank meets the Real World - Girl Starter is changing the access game, making it possible for girls across the US to make their dreams happen. Dani also has a long history producing live musicals on Broadway and for national tours with partners such as Working Title Films, Dreamworks, Universal Pictures Theatrical and NETworks Presentations. She is engaged in building new interactive, entertaining, and educational touring models with IMG and her new venture, Dance House. First projects include two popular title dance pieces in rep with first hand engagement for local dancers. Ms. Davis is an Emmy Award winning songwriter for Handel's Messiah Rocks. For PBS, Dani has directed large scale live music projects. She has written and directed webisode series and live events for the Meredith Corporation. She has written songs for the PBS children's series, Kid Concoctions. She has directed musicals around the country, and looks forward to more time for this creative work.I understand that there are many opportunities to donate your hard earned money to many different causes, so I appreciate any help you can provide. Thank you so much for considering my request.Jeffrey Doornbos moved to Los Angeles from New York City, where he was a Blue Man and a director with the internationally known Blue Man Group for many years. During his time in New York, he also appeared in many productions throughout the city, and regionally.

<h3>""Oh, you're a shoe-in for that grant!""</h3>
<p>famous last words.<br/><br/><i>Mesdames et Messieurs</i>, the show must go on. How can we not? We're a brand-new <i>être</i> given the gift of two weeks at the venerable <strong>Centaur Theatre</strong> in<i> le Vieux Montréal</i>.  We have this important new play by two young, local creators and this new way of working, <i>cette rencontre</i>, across linguistic and disciplinary divides. This is a project worth living for.</p>
<p><strong>CHLORINE</strong> is the story of Sarah, a teenager with tetraplegia (who communicates only by opening and closing her eyes), her ever-vigilant parents, and her new friend Nathan. This play-wrapped-in-a-ballet takes a tragic real-life event and turns it into a celebration of youth, friendship, caregiving, the 80s,<i>The Sound of Music, </i>and everything messy and wonderful about how we relate to each other.</p>
<p><strong>c r e a t u r e / c r e a t u r e</strong>  is a performance unit with a drive to come face to face with the other, to seek the strange in the familiar and the familiar in the strange. In this case, that means combining the talents of francophone and anglophone creators in a mash-up of theatre and dance.</p>
<p><i>La pièce originale, <strong>CHLORE</strong>, de Florence Longpré et Nicolas Michon, était le premier succès pour le <strong>Théâtre du Grand Cheval</strong>, et a fait salles combles à La Licorne en 2012 et au Théâtre d'Aujourd'hui en 2014. </i></p>
<p>Guided by Johanna Nutter, the creator of the international hit <i><strong>My Pregnant Brother</strong> (<strong>Mon frère est enceinte)</strong> </i>and the response piece <i>My Playwright Sister </i>(next stop for the double-bill will be Calgary's<i> High Performance Rodeo </i>in January 2017), we collaborators are applying a <i>mixologie</i> approach to making art.</p>
<p><strong>BUT WHY??</strong></p>
<p>When asked why we did not get the grant, we were told that although our application was evaluated highly, it was rejected because Johanna was untried as a director and because the jury was not convinced of the validity of our mandate. By supporting this campaign, you will be sending a message that risk, innovation, and connectivity are valid contributions to the artistic landscape.</p>
<p><strong>HERE'S HOW YOU CAN HELP!</strong></p>
<p>We're sharing all the profits equally, and at this point, with a realistic estimate of ticket sales and the financial support we'll receive from the Centaur, we still need to raise close to $10,000 to keep our translator/director/producer from going into debt and to afford our 7 performers, 3 designers, 2 creator/choreographers, stage manager and technician basic compensation. Playwright and numerologist Jesse Stong suggested that $9888 was the most sacred and infinite number. So we're going with that as a target. We have some truly impressive art donations we will be surprising you with along the way, putting the FUN in the 'draising for people across the globe.</p>
</div><div>

</div><p> </p></div>","""Oh, you're a shoe-in for that grant!""
famous last words.Mesdames et Messieurs, the show must go on. How can we not? We're a brand-new être given the gift of two weeks at the venerable Centaur Theatre in le Vieux Montréal.  We have this important new play by two young, local creators and this new way of working, cette rencontre, across linguistic and disciplinary divides. This is a project worth living for.
CHLORINE is the story of Sarah, a teenager with tetraplegia (who communicates only by opening and closing her eyes), her ever-vigilant parents, and her new friend Nathan. This play-wrapped-in-a-ballet takes a tragic real-life event and turns it into a celebration of youth, friendship, caregiving, the 80s,The Sound of Music, and everything messy and wonderful about how we relate to each other.
c r e a t u r e / c r e a t u r e  is a performance unit with a drive to come face to face with the other, to seek the strange in the familiar and the familiar in the strange. In this case, that means combining the talents of francophone and anglophone creators in a mash-up of theatre and dance.
La pièce originale, CHLORE, de Florence Longpré et Nicolas Michon, était le premier succès pour le Théâtre du Grand Cheval, et a fait salles combles à La Licorne en 2012 et au Théâtre d'Aujourd'hui en 2014. 
Guided by Johanna Nutter, the creator of the international hit My Pregnant Brother (Mon frère est enceinte) and the response piece My Playwright Sister (next stop for the double-bill will be Calgary's High Performance Rodeo in January 2017), we collaborators are applying a mixologie approach to making art.
BUT WHY??
When asked why we did not get the grant, we were told that although our application was evaluated highly, it was rejected because Johanna was untried as a director and because the jury was not convinced of the validity of our mandate. By supporting this campaign, you will be sending a message that risk, innovation, and connectivity are valid contributions to the artistic landscape.
HERE'S HOW YOU CAN HELP!
We're sharing all the profits equally, and at this point, with a realistic estimate of ticket sales and the financial support we'll receive from the Centaur, we still need to raise close to $10,000 to keep our translator/director/producer from going into debt and to afford our 7 performers, 3 designers, 2 creator/choreographers, stage manager and technician basic compensation. Playwright and numerologist Jesse Stong suggested that $9888 was the most sacred and infinite number. So we're going with that as a target. We have some truly impressive art donations we will be surprising you with along the way, putting the FUN in the 'draising for people across the globe.

If you're in Montreal, the best way to contribute is by calling 514-288-3161 for tickets ($15-$28) to CHLORINE, playing Tuesday through Saturday, October 19 - 29 @7:30pm, with a 2:30pm matinee only on the 29th. (75min)
I'm confident that experiencing this story will be significantly rewarding. Please, give yourself this gift. If you just can't afford it, contact me and we'll work something out. This is the most beautiful play I've encountered and I don't want anyone to miss it.

And of course, THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS WITH YOUR PEEPS!

Alvaro led a workshop for the community where he demonstrated the contemporary dance methods he uses to cultivate comfort, safety and empowerment for the children in his program. I was completely blown away by the power and simplicity of his methods. I felt a therapeutic shift in my body. I was in an abusive relationship at the time, but had not yet realized it. </p>
<p>Ever since then it has been my intention to go to El Colegio Del Cuerpo to learn these methods and train with Alvaro Restrepo. In 2008 I set out to reach El Colegio by bicycle; I made it to Nicaragua, but fell short of my dream. Seven years later, the organization has grown exponentially, and my growth as a person, as a dancer, and as a researcher gives this mission even greater significance. </p>

What am I doing?
 Throughout my work as a dancer, teacher and choreographer, dance has helped me heal from a past of intimate partner abuse. Because of my own experience utilizing dance as a tool for personal empowerment, I am interested in exploring the profound healing power that dance can bring to trauma survivors. My current interdisciplinary research on how the body stores memories suggests that dance is an effective healing modality because it enables trauma survivors to access, process and integrate traumatic memories stored in the body.
In this campaign, I'm asking for your financial fuel to embark on the next phase of my research, which is to study the methods used in a highly effective program at El Colegio Del Cuerpo in Cartagena, Colombia that implements contemporary dance training as a way to heal and empower children who come from difficult pasts of poverty, abuse, and human trafficking. 


My name is Bonnie Cox and I am an MFA dance student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I am combining psychology with dance in my performative, choreographic, pedagogical and scholarly work. 
In 2013 I produced a dance concert in Austin, Texas called Silence To Power: Dance as a response to trauma, that featured dances created by local artists to help them process traumatic experiences. After creating a solo that encapsulated my experience with intimate partner abuse, I was inspired to give dancers in the community an opportunity to share their experiences through their creative work.

The money I raise through this campaign will fund a preliminary trip to Cartagena in August, where I will clarify my research goals by meeting with the faculty and students at El Colegio Del Cuerpo, observing classes, and immersing myself in the environment. I will spend the next two semesters deepening the theoretical components of my research and securing grants to fund an extended trip to Cartagena next summer.    Economic Necessity  Grad school is an expensive endeavor, and Boulder is an expensive city to live in, so this trip is impossible for me to fund on my own.

My intention is to work to increase the accessibility of this form of therapy to trauma survivors, and to improve upon current therapeutic dance practices. I will extend the reach of the work El Colegio Del Cuerpo has pioneered by incorporating the organization's methods into my teaching and choreography, and by sharing them with other trauma survivors, movement artists and therapists. Photo by Andrew Masi

headlines for years now, and the Church hierarchy and abusive priests are

<p>John developed TRUST in Minneapolis with the Self-Reliant Actors Workshop he

<p>The play tells the story of a Catholic college senior, Michael, who must
come to terms with the sexual abuse he endured as a child by a trusted priest, who is also a close family friend.
Michael thought he had escaped his past when he went away to college, but as
graduation day approaches, his past catches up to him. His world begins to fall

between memories of past trauma and the normalcy he thought he had successfully
built. </p>
<p>TRUST gives voice to the victims and their families and
portrays the Catholic Church's profoundly negligent and scandalous response to
the issue.  At the same time the play demonstrates the courage
and love of those within the church and outside who put compassion and healing
ahead of personal gain and institutional reputation. We have shared the

<p>John was inspired to write TRUST when he directed <i>Apostle on the Edge</i>
by Jim Hanson, who wrote and performed this solo theater piece in Minneapolis. Jim
shared the heartbreaking story of his abuse and its devastating effects on him
and his family, and, as a life-long Catholic, John felt compelled to
bring it to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Your support will allow us to tell this story with maximum impact - rehearsal space, production design, and a cast that will bring it to life and

<p><i>Nickel Mines </i>is an intersection of the creative team's highest held beliefs; that the arts can and should provide challenging and artistically satisfying interpretations of socially relevant issues. <br/></p>
<p>It's no secret that America is facing a gun violence epidemic.

<p>As <i>Nickel Mines</i> moves forward beyond NYMF, a portion of ticket sales will go directly to victims of gun violence. We are supporters and collaborators of Everytown For Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense In America, The Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence, The Coalition To Stop Gun Violence and others. <i>Nickel Mines</i> is proud to partner with these organizations and to continue to foster the conversation about the culture of violence that has tragically gripped our nation. <br/></p>
<p>All of this said, <i>Nickel Mines</i> is a piece of theatre. We do not impose our own judgments on the people and stories of Lancaster, PA. We only aim to provide a lens through which to look at October 2nd, 2006, and to see how acts of violence affect not only the victims and their families, but those related to the killer and the community as a whole. <br/></p>
<p>The grace Mr. Stanley so thoughtfully mentioned is the Amish community's public and practically instant forgiveness of the killer of their children.

Obviously, more and more people are concluding that the death penalty is a punishment that Texas can do without.In 2015 Nebraska abolished its death penalty and Connecticut's highest court ordered that state's death row emptied out because it said the death penalty was unconstitutional. In 2015, we successfully lobbied Texas state senator Eddie Lucio Jr to file a bill for the first time in the Texas senate to abolish the Texas death penalty. Yet 2015 has also seen 10 people executed in Texas so far, with another 8 executions scheduled in Texas before the end of the year.Texas has executed 528 people since 1982. Innocent PeopleTodd Willingham, who was an innocent person executed by Texas in 2004, was one of more than 250 people executed under former Texas Governor Rick Perry.Alfred Dewayne Brown became the latest person exonerated off Texas death row on June 8, 2015. “I went in an innocent man and I came out an innocent man,” said Brown.Anthony Graves is an innocent person who was released in October 27, 2010 after 18 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, including 14 years on Texas death row.After a short pre-march speaker's program, we will march through the streets of downtown Austin with a stop in front of the Texas Governor's mansion and return to the Texas Capitol to hear more speakers against the death penalty.Each October since 2000, people from all walks of life and all parts of Texas, the U.S. and other countries have taken a day out of their year and gathered in Austin to raise their voices together and loudly express their opposition to the death penalty. The march is a coming together of activists, family members of people on death row, community leaders, exonerated former death row prisoners and all those calling for repeal of the Texas death penalty.The annual march is organized as a joint project by several Texas anti-death penalty organizations and their allies, including Texas Moratorium Network, the Austin chapter of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty, the Texas Death Penalty Abolition Movement, Students Against the Death Penalty, Kids Against the Death Penalty, and the Journey of Hope ... from Violence to Healing.",1.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<p>Our inaugural production, 30 Neo-Futurist Plays from ""Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind"" (30 Plays in 60 Minutes), not only challenges artists with a title that is longer than some of its plays, but with a style of performance which breaks the mold of traditional theatre conventions.

<div>On a personal level, producing TML is an opportunity for a group of young artists to test out their skills in an entirely new way.

TML forces audiences to rethink their preconceptions about what a theatrical production can be. We think that in the world of ""peak TV"" and Netflix, the theatre needs to perpetually reinvent itself to stay relevant, and shows like TML, which rely so heavily on audience participation and current events, are a way to do just that.

<h3><b>Impact of the project </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<b> </b><p></p>
<p>This
project explores contemporary issues around poverty, homelessness, mental
health, addictions and more – issues that unfortunately are commonplace in the
Yukon as well as many other regions.. Our capital city of Whitehorse has high
rates of poverty, addictions, disability and mental health issues and related
stigma, lack of affordable housing, a significant minority population (25%) of
Yukon First Nations peoples dealing with colonization and residential school
trauma, large gap between rich and poor, dedicated community organizations,
growing visible minority community, and an extremely vibrant arts community
which is not always accessible to and reflective of marginalized people and
groups.</p>
<p>Our
project draws upon themes raised in this new Yukon play while allowing
community members to develop and share their own stories, see the play <i>Paradise </i>for themselves and be fully
involved in a larger community dialogue with responses to the art and how it
connects – or doesn’t – with present-day realities. </p>

professional plays to empower Indigenous and northern voices. </p>
<p>We’re a small theatre company based in Whitehorse,
Yukon Territory with big seasons and bigger dreams – all with part-time staff
and a small office with a view of the Yukon River. Whitehorse is a scenic,
vibrant city of almost 28,000 and the entire Yukon has only 36,000 people.</p>
<p>We’re founded by a pair of artists – Vuntut
Gwitchin playwright and journalist Leonard Linklater, born and raised in the
North; and playwright Patti Flather, who fell in love with the North. Since
then, we’ve developed, produced and toured many plays and readings, from tiny
remote communities like Old Crow to the nation’s capital in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Gwaandak Theatre
productions are recognized for their exploration of the human condition,
particularly from Indigenous, northern and diverse perspectives. We’re known
for our commitment to Aboriginal, rural and youth audiences and relationships
with community partners to deepen dialogue and promote greater accessibility of
theatre arts.</p>

<p></p><br/><br/></div>","Help us to:



Share
Paradise at the Yukon Arts Centre in Whitehorse, Yukon from March 24-28, 2015
and in Haines Junction, Yukon the following week


Organize
post-show talkbacks around issues explored in Paradise, including mental
health, homelessness, addictions, poverty, human rights and justice


Hold
community storytelling workshops involving people with lived experience of
issues raised in Paradise, with community partners including Yukon Anti-Poverty
Coalition


Make
rehearsals and performances accessible to all people in our community,
including our pay-what-you-can preview


Create
a study and resource guide



This project matters. Here's why:







Theatre matters. Theatre remains a
vibrant, sacred place where people come together to share stories. We all need
stories. Stories are who we are. They are our society. Our weaknesses. Our
dreams.  Paradise is a thought-provoking
play which explores characters trying to do what we all, remain human, in the
face of challenges including mental and physical health issues, poverty,
addictions, human rights and justice.


Theatre matters to everyone. This
project includes outreach to help people get to see the play – with a low-cost
preview and blocks of tickets donated for lower-income citizens – in
partnership with community organizations like the Yukon Anti-Poverty Coalition. Also, every Yukon community deserves the chance to enjoy the arts. We’re taking this play to the small rural Yukon community of Haines Junction, and offering a theatre workshop to high school students.


Everyone’s stories matter. Community
storytelling workshops are geared to people with lived experience of issues
raised in the play, and who may not have had opportunities to explore
performing arts before.





What do we need
funds for?
Gwaandak Theatre is a professional company which is
both artist-centred and community minded. While we welcome volunteers, we pay
all principal artists and production team members who will be working full-time
on this project. We’ve almost raised enough funds for this world premiere
production from our public funders, corporate and private donors, and sponsors.
We’re nearly there. 
Funds raised will pay for:



Two facilitators
for our weekend community storytelling workshops with experience in the
performing arts, individual and community empowerment


A part-time
coordinator for our community outreach, including workshops and audience
talkbacks, in partnership with Yukon Anti-Poverty Coalition and other
non-profit groups

Resource guide
writer

And a portion of the following:


Our four talented
actors, director, designers, stage manager, technicians and everyone on our
team who will make the magic happen. They are outstanding professionals from
the Yukon and other parts of Canada


A simple, decent
place with a kitchen for our guest artists to call home for 6 weeks in the
Yukon


Set, props, and
costumes


Advertising so
people know about the play and community workshops


Accommodations for
two nights in Haines Junction, 150 kilometres from Whitehorse, while we share
the play there




Impact of the project 


 
This
project explores contemporary issues around poverty, homelessness, mental
health, addictions and more – issues that unfortunately are commonplace in the
Yukon as well as many other regions.. Our capital city of Whitehorse has high
rates of poverty, addictions, disability and mental health issues and related
stigma, lack of affordable housing, a significant minority population (25%) of
Yukon First Nations peoples dealing with colonization and residential school
trauma, large gap between rich and poor, dedicated community organizations,
growing visible minority community, and an extremely vibrant arts community
which is not always accessible to and reflective of marginalized people and
groups.
Our
project draws upon themes raised in this new Yukon play while allowing
community members to develop and share their own stories, see the play Paradise for themselves and be fully
involved in a larger community dialogue with responses to the art and how it
connects – or doesn’t – with present-day realities. 
Anticipated
impacts include:



Bringing community together in sharing a
story that we believe will make us think, feel and talk with each other about
our world, our places in it, and how we can promote meaningful connection and
dignity for all of us.


Empowering people to tell their own
stories in community workshops.


Increased awareness of and compassion
for people with mental health, poverty, addictions and human rights barriers


Promoting resources in the Yukon around
mental health, addictions, homelessness, poverty and human rights


Offering valued and challenging
opportunities for both emerging and established artists in the Yukon and across
Canada to bring a new Canadian play to life for audiences

We’re a small theatre company based in Whitehorse,
Yukon Territory with big seasons and bigger dreams – all with part-time staff
and a small office with a view of the Yukon River. Whitehorse is a scenic,

We’re founded by a pair of artists – Vuntut
Gwitchin playwright and journalist Leonard Linklater, born and raised in the
North; and playwright Patti Flather, who fell in love with the North. Since
then, we’ve developed, produced and toured many plays and readings, from tiny
remote communities like Old Crow to the nation’s capital in Ottawa.

particularly from Indigenous, northern and diverse perspectives. We’re known

<h3>The Company</h3>
<p>This production showcases emerging and established Vancouver-based artists. The cast includes <strong>Bronwen Smith </strong>(Classic Chic’s <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>) and <strong>Annie Arbuckle</strong> (Aenigma Theatre’s <i>No Exit</i>). The production team includes: <strong>Erica Leduc</strong> (Stage Management), Aenigma Theatre Co-Artistic Director <strong>Sarah Melo</strong> (Set Design), <strong>Alix Miller </strong>(Costume Design), <strong>Chengyan Boon</strong> (Lighting Design), and two-time Jessie Nominee <strong>Scott Zechner</strong> (Sound Design).

<p>Aenigma Theatre was founded by Tanya Mathivanan in 2013 with the belief that, in many ways, people are all enigmas, to each other as well as to themselves. Tanya's diagnosis of Fibromyalgia at the age of 15 amplified her interest in exploring the complexities of the human condition. Together with Co-Artistic Director, Sarah Melo, and a team of talented designers, Aenigma Theatre seeks to engage the community emotionally and intellectually by applying its unique aesthetic to challenging, relevant plays.  <a href=""http://www.aenigmatheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.aenigmatheatre.com</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This play is important and startlingly relevant to the community, especially in this Socio-Political Climate. Conversations surrounding women, as well as the science field, have dominated headlines in recent years, and have gotten worryingly controversial. We believe that the issues articulated in this play are often ignored or dismissed, and that it is extremely important to highlight them in a public sphere and medium. </p>
<p>This work is also emblematic of the female voice: it has an all female cast and director, it depicts two fully-rounded, complex female characters, and is also written by a female playwright. This is a rarity in an often male-dominated theatre scene, which allows us to discuss female bodies in space openly and honestly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>This production is currently completely self financed. Therefore, we're hoping to raise approximately $1500 through the generous contributions of people such as yourself to help offset some of our costs. As a small, Not-For-Profit Theatre Company, any funds that we raise at all will help significantly. We are committed to paying all of our Artist for their work. However we would also like to keep ticket costs as affordable.</p>
<p>Your donations will go towards helping us cover the significant costs of Play Rights (approximately $1200 for Professional Rights), Theatre, Space ($2,872.00), Artist Fees ($6277.31), Props/Set/Costumes ($550) along with other marketing and logistical costs.  Any amount, no matter how small, that you are able to spare will be invaluable to us, and truly appreciated</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to aid us financially, don't worry, we understand! We would greatly appreciate it if you would consider spreading the word through platforms such as facebook and twitter.

""Akka""</b></p>
<p>This July, Avant is proud to present the re-staging
of the 1991 smash hit, “Akka”, and its much awaited sequel, “Akka - The End” as
a double bill production guaranteed to be ‘singularly refreshing’!</p>
<p>A first in Tamil theatre, the “Akka” plays will
focus on the issues surrounding Indian transgender women in Singapore and the
lives they lead in face of sexual discrimination and communal exile. Taking
inspiration from real-life accounts, “Akka” will be a compelling production
that will re-evaluate our society’s understanding of sexuality and the phobias
and prejudices it harbours on those who both captivate, and repulse its social
fabric. </p>
<p><b>Sponsership</b></p>
<p>We seek your generosity through financial support
that could help alleviate the financial burden of this project. Your support
and partnership will greatly influence the quality of the presentation, talent
development, marketing outreach and aid production costs such as venue rental.</p>
<p>As you may already know, staging a performance is
no simple feat, especially by a non-profit organisation such as ours. We humbly
seek your considerate and substantial sponsorship so that our artistic vision
may be realized. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Given the recent debates on sexuality that have

me a stronger singer, actress, and dancer, and help me realize my dream of someday
appearing on Broadway.
Any amount you can contribute will put me closer to attending
the Summer Intensive at the Boston Conservatory (and help my family immensely).
I know that the experience I stand to gain there will help me become a triple
threat performer with the confidence and ability to someday make my Broadway
dreams come true.I am turning to all of you for help. Summer Intensives aren’t
cheap and the one in Boston is no different. The tuition is $2,250, and housing
and meals are another $1,900. Travel expenses, pointe shoes, leotards, and
laundry will be additional. My parents have agreed to put a total of $2,000
towards it but I still need to come up with a good chunk of money to make up
the difference. I plan on doing what I can to earn money and have a bake sale planned
in May. However, between school and dance classes, my schedule doesn’t allow me
much free time to earn money … but I guarantee that I’ll keep working hard to
earn every penny I can. 

Please know that I am forever grateful for
anything you are able to contribute!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Brooklyn-born Clara Bow came from abject poverty and was determined from an early age to become a movie star. Her mother was mentally ill, and her father was an idle alcoholic, who rarely worked. Somehow Clara managed to scrape together enough money for some photographs and with them she entered a popular movie magazine beauty contest, and won it. The Fame and Fortune contest promised the winner pictures in the Magazine, a part in a movie and an evening dress.</p>
<p>Little did anyone realize this was the first step in what would become an amazing if short lived career in Hollywood pictures. Clara made it through the talkies  transition and was a highly paid and in-demand actress. She turned her back on Hollywood at the remarkably young age of 28.  For a really vivid overview of Clara check out the BBC video at You Tube (click the arrow above). It will inform those of you who may be less familiar with her history<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98wtDTbGBvk."" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">.</a> This documentary is very well done and very informative..</p>
<p>We have written a show that takes the theater audience through Clara's incredible life from the age of 16 until her passing at the age of 60 in a Culver City bungalow, a nearly forgotten star. Listen to the simple demos of the first two songs. The first is ""Hittin The Bricks""  which decribes how Clara's first agent Maxine Alton will get her around New York City right after she won the Fame and Fortune contest. The second song is ""On the Road Before Me Now""  sung at the end of Act One when Clara departs for Hollywood to see if she can truly become a Movie Star</p>
<p>It's going to be a big musical. The role of Clara will be played by two actresses, one for the 1920's and another as Clara in later years. I have written the Book and Lyrics. The delightful score is by Barry Fasman, my long time writing partner, with whom I wrote the musical Chinaberry Bayou ( ASCAP and Disney's first Musical Theater workshop.) Among his many achievements, Barry was Musical Director for FAME which ran on NBC-TV for many years. </p>
<p>Our project is in need of funding to record 16 new songs for the score, and to begin the workshop process, where we sit with actors and dancers to work out the production. I have done this before, most recently with The Seven Year Itch, which I have workshopped twice, once with Jane Kralowski and Peter Scolari and once with Rachel York and Ross Lehman, both in New York. Indiegogo backers will help us develop this project for the Broadway stage by raising the funds to cover the costs of recording demos, preparing the script, hiring rehearsal space, finding and casting actors in the parts and developing the art direction of the project. </p>
<p>Here is  a portion of the script with the song  ""Hittin the Bricks""  Remember  at this stage we have just a simple demo. It will be professionally recorded later.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Sarah Tuning has dedicated herself to bringing beauty into the world by dancing on stage.  She applied and was accepted into the California State School of the Arts in their summer dance program with an emphasis in ballet.  Sarah did receive a partial scholarship, but not enough to cover the expenses of the tuition, the supplies and the travel to and from Valencia.   For a minimal amount of funding, we can further Sarah's dreams.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>After scholarship, tuition to CSSSA is $1050.</p>
<p>Sarah also needs to purchase jazz shoes, knee pads, a CD-R or iPod, a Lapa, new pointe shoes, several new leotards and tights and other supplies so she is prepared for her month of classes in Southern California.  We estimate this will cost between $300 and $500.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sarah needs to be able to get to and from Valencia.  Depending on the funds raised, driving her down and back would cost $300 or flying her down and back would cost $450.</p>
<p>What you get?  Satisfaction in helping a rising young dancer and scholar, a personal thank you note, recognition in her dance recital program, and a copy of her final dance recital video from CSSSA.  Finally, you get immense gratitude from a young lady whose dreams are in the making.</p>
<p>In addition, if you have suggestions for what you might like as a ""perk"", please let us know and we'll see if it can be accommodated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sarah is two steps away from Company where she currently dances and she dreams of going to college to major in dance.  We're a family of artists and musicians so funds have to stretch as far as they can.  Sarah is talented and has a giving heart and shares her art form with younger students.  Attending CSSSA would give her more knowledge to share and with which to create a more peaceful and beautiful world.</p>
<p>Sarah says, ""Attending CSSSA, first and foremost, would greatly further my dance skills.  It would give me experience working with teachers and dance forms that I would not normally have the opportunity to do.  CSSSA would also allow me to network in the dance world, as well as have the opportunity for further scholarships for college.  In addition, upon graduation from the program I would be named a California Arts Scholar which helps when applying for colleges of dance.""</p>

</div></div>","So…What Is This?
Featuring Christine Schisano and Abby Pechman as the writers and performers of this original sketch comedy show. 
“Dear Tina: I’m Wearing a Wig” has been a passion project for
over 8 months and will finally be realized November 2014. Through many ideas, good and bad, we
are finally ready to put something up in front of live people.  There is only so much feedback one can
get from a Chihuahua.
This show will feature live sketch comedy, filmed sketch comedy,
original music as well as song parodies. 

The location is currently TBA.....once contracts are signed we will confirm the location!!
What We Need 
All funds raised will go to:
-Theatre rental and fees
-Costuming
-Wigs…lots of wigs
-Props
-Rehearsal space 
-Filming and editing of sketches
-Paying the actors enough to get a large iced coffee
Check out our page for some great PERKS when you donate!
If we exceed our goal, the surplus of funds will be applied
to our upcoming sketch comedy web series Spring 2015!
The Impact
Many hours have been spent, over coffee and beer and on
late-night subway rides, writing and dreaming of putting up our own project.
(And meeting Tina Fey) 
We want to make people laugh. (Especially Tina Fey) 
We want to take an idea and make it a reality. (Tina can you
hear us?)
Risks & Challenges
This show is a huge risk for us.   Any show in NYC is a risk.  Will anyone show up?  Will anyone be drunk enough to laugh at
our work?  Will the wigs stay on
our tiny, misshapen heads?
We think this risk is worth it!

<h3>The Little Match Girl on Tour!</h3>
<p>In March 2012 we presented a brand new theatrical imagining of 'The Little Match Girl' to audiences in Manchester, UK. The show was such a success, less than a week later we were offered the chance to tour the show as part of a cross-cultural exchange in Tunis!</p>
<ul>
<li>Schmucks Theatre was founded in Manchester in 2009 and has since produced 7 acclaimed productions across the UK. 'The Little Match Girl' will mark the third country we have performed in, and our first international tour! The show won three Manchester In Fringe Theatre Awards; for Best Director, Best Lighting and The Judge's Award for Originality and Innovation. </li>
<li>We are planning on touring the show AND making a documentary about the entire process. This isn't just taking an award-winning show to another country, this is also giving us the opportunity to make a (hopefully award-winning) documentary about the whole process, from the first rehearsal to the plane ride home!</li>
<li>The production has the potential to be received in any culture, and by an audience of any language. The piece is without spoken dialogue, and is very visual, featuring extensive, complex puppetry. The show also features an original score, which is performed live as part of the performance, fully immersing the audience in the world of 'The Little Match Girl'.</li>
<li>By contributing to this project, you will be enabling a group of emerging British theatre and filmmakers to have their work seen on the international stage at an early point in their careers; not only benefiting them, but also aiding the development of the exciting cultural scene in Tunisia following the peaceful revolution there. This project will have an impact on people internationally, not just at home! The project is championed by the University of Manchester's research programme 'In Place of War', which is currently focussing on the digitlisation and online sharing of theatre practitioner's work following the Arab Spring. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Lets break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise the money to pay for 20 return flights from London to Tunis. As you can well imagine, these don't come too cheap! We have a cast of 9, a director, producer, two stage hands, a musical director, a band of four, a documentary filmmaker and a cello to get across the pond to Tunis! We want to take the production in its entirety from Manchester, so that we don't sacrifice on artistic quality for our Tunisian audiences. Move over Lloyd-Webber, this is the theatrical tour of the year!</li>
<li>We also need to raise the money to pay for the hire of sound equipment for the making of the documentary, for the week that we will be working in Tunisia. </li>
<li>We have some really great perks for you all, to get you excited about helping us (literally) get this project off the ground! These include tickets, signed posters and props, and a very exciting exclusive filmed version of the show! A school play this show ain't, and the DVD will reflect that, with the show being filmed specially on location in Tunis. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, then all of the money we have been able to raise will go towards cutting the cost of flights for everybody involved as much as we can to make this amazing opoortunity become a reality.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why you should support us</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a rare opportunity to take an exciting revitilization of a classical piece of European culture into an African artistic community, and to share our culture with the audiences of Tunisia. In the years following the revolution in Tunisia, the cultural scene there is thriving, finally able to develop its artistic practise without a dominating, censoring regime. By taking 'The Little Match Girl' into this cultural revolution, we are able to learn from Tunisian artistic practises and Tunisian art culture, as well as weaving our own work into the thriving cultural fabric of the country. This will not only benefit the participants of the tour, but also all those who view the documentary, as we hope it will capture the reality of the cross-cultural exchange process, and share it with as wide an audience as possible. </li>
<li>Schmucks Theatre, and Nathan Shreeve (Director) has a strong track record for theatrical work, being critically acclaimed in publications such as The Huffington Post, The Scotsman, Whatsonstage and The Jewish Chronicle. Schmucks Theatre has been seen at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the Buxton Fringe Festival, and even the Liverpool Shakespeare Festival. </li>
<li>Jo Gewirtz, our resident filmmaker has had her work exhibited at the London Soho Shorts Festival, on the TimeWarner cable network in the US, and UK satellite television. She has worked on music videos (Mel C's 'Rock Me'), documentaries (The Rushes - London Soho Shorts) and narrative short films (<em>Can I Interest You in Christ</em> - New York Film Academy). </li>

<h3>Who We Are:<br/>
</h3> <p>We are three theatre artists and friends coming together to put on an original play in the Venus/Adonis Theater Festival in NYC this February.  But putting on a play is a big job, especially for three people just in the relative beginning of their professional theatrical careers, and we could use some support to make this production one that we can be completely pleased with and proud of.<br/></p>
<p>We are Benjamin Shipley, Matt Hays and Lisa VillaMil, three graduates from Ithaca College with the singular desire to make good theatre.  Between us we have dozens upon dozens of productions, ranging in experience from stage management to acting to design, and everything else in-between.  We are people who live for the arts, and who are passionate about telling  truthful, meaningful stories through our theatrical medium.  <br/></p>
<p>We are taking on all aspects of this production all by ourselves, from playwrighting to producing, from directing to acting and advertizing.  Yeah.  We're going to be pretty busy.  But ownership of a production is important to us.  It allows us to be our most creative, experimental and independent.<br/></p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you are helping us ensure our ownership, and also enabling us to take an otherwise basic production and make it an extraordinary one.  Our set will improve in aesthetic; we will hire a Stage Manager to help keep the production on track; you will help us pay for festival costs and professional recording - and those are just a few of the ways you could help us, all of which would make a huge impact on the overall success of our production and vision.<br/></p>
<p>By helping us, you would nurture three budding artists, and help us create a foothold for our careers in one of the greatest - and possibly the most pivotal - theatrical cities in the world.  <br/></p>

<p>If our campaign doesn't reach its goal, we will have to cut the professional recording of our show - something that could be put on actors' reels, or be used to advertise the play to other theatres for further productions.  We will also have to cut back significantly in advertising and set design.  While none of these are things that would break our production, their inclusion would ensure that our show is fully successful with a hopefully packed house, and a chance to win prizes at the end of the festival's run.  The Venus/Adonis Theater Festival is also a competition, and we want a product worthy of competition standards, as well as our own high artistic standards.</p>

<p>“The Journey” follows the progression of dance history from the traditionally theatre-based art form as it develops and expands out into the world. Comprised of four distinct movements, this film follows a dancer’s experience in each of the pieces as she adapts to the new styles. Several phrases of movement echo throughout the project, as the pieces of choreography dynamically alter and grow depending on the style being performed. </p>
<p>First movement (2:31) – Classical ballet performed in a traditional theatre setting, with lights, costumes, and music reflecting the recent history of the art.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Second movement (2:10) – A study in modern dance, based in Duncan, Limon, and Graham techniques. Filming will take place in the gardens of a local park, representing the return of dance to the earth from the theatre. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Third movement (1:19) – Gesture-based choreography, utilizing American Sign Language as the basis for creating its motions. This movement will be filmed at the water to incorporate different elements into the environments. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Fourth movement (2:59) – Contemporary dance, filmed in a busy, common location. Unexpected pops of dancing will erupt from the pedestrians, after which they return to normality (walking, on their phones, tying shoelaces, etc.) This piece is the culmination of the project, showing the pervasiveness of dance and movement in everyday life, even if it is not choreographed. Anyone can dance. I repeat: ANYONE can dance. This piece shows the dancers of life. </p>
<p>At the end of the project, we will email out a private video link with a limited time access. This will allow all of you lovely contributors to see all of the things that we were able to do through your generosity. I want to share this project with the people who made it possible!! Thanks for believing in me!</p>
<p> Budget summary: </p>
<p>Crew – $1500 (Cameramen, photographers, lighting techs, logistical assistants) </p>
<p>Equipment – $2300 (Cameras, rentals, editing software, lights) </p>
<p>Logistics - $1200 (stylists, costumes, sets, etc.)</p>
<p></p>Risks and challenges? Yes. There will be lots. I'm in school, so timing, coordination, and logistics all present potential problems. But, I have an amazing team to work with, from my co-producer Anthony, to the costume designer Summer, and all of the other crew that want to make this a success. We will make this project happen, and we are so excited to get started! I have three other choreographers working with me for the finale, so the craziest part has the most people covering it. We have all of our team, now we need to get the rest of the equipment and finalize the production schedule. We have to maneuver the theatre schedule, the local weather (for the outdoor shots), and get adequate permissions for our final location. Honestly, I don't know what to expect. I have never done anything like this before. But, I have to start somewhere, and what better support group than other people who love the arts? No one starts out knowing it all, so I am looking forward to learning and adapting as this project comes together.<br/><p></p>

Comprised of four distinct movements, this film follows a dancer’s experience in each of the pieces as she adapts to the new styles. Several phrases of movement echo throughout the project, as the pieces of choreography dynamically alter and grow depending on the style being performed. 
First movement (2:31) – Classical ballet performed in a traditional theatre setting, with lights, costumes, and music reflecting the recent history of the art.


Second movement (2:10) – A study in modern dance, based in Duncan, Limon, and Graham techniques. Filming will take place in the gardens of a local park, representing the return of dance to the earth from the theatre. 


 Third movement (1:19) – Gesture-based choreography, utilizing American Sign Language as the basis for creating its motions. This movement will be filmed at the water to incorporate different elements into the environments. 


 Fourth movement (2:59) – Contemporary dance, filmed in a busy, common location. Unexpected pops of dancing will erupt from the pedestrians, after which they return to normality (walking, on their phones, tying shoelaces, etc.) This piece is the culmination of the project, showing the pervasiveness of dance and movement in everyday life, even if it is not choreographed. Anyone can dance. I repeat: ANYONE can dance. This piece shows the dancers of life. 
At the end of the project, we will email out a private video link with a limited time access. This will allow all of you lovely contributors to see all of the things that we were able to do through your generosity. I want to share this project with the people who made it possible!! Thanks for believing in me!
 Budget summary: 
Crew – $1500 (Cameramen, photographers, lighting techs, logistical assistants) 
Equipment – $2300 (Cameras, rentals, editing software, lights) 
Logistics - $1200 (stylists, costumes, sets, etc.)
Risks and challenges? Yes. There will be lots. I'm in school, so timing, coordination, and logistics all present potential problems. But, I have an amazing team to work with, from my co-producer Anthony, to the costume designer Summer, and all of the other crew that want to make this a success. We will make this project happen, and we are so excited to get started! I have three other choreographers working with me for the finale, so the craziest part has the most people covering it. We have all of our team, now we need to get the rest of the equipment and finalize the production schedule. We have to maneuver the theatre schedule, the local weather (for the outdoor shots), and get adequate permissions for our final location. Honestly, I don't know what to expect. I have never done anything like this before. But, I have to start somewhere, and what better support group than other people who love the arts? No one starts out knowing it all, so I am looking forward to learning and adapting as this project comes together.

</h3>
<p>We provide an affordable, accessible, and intergenerational community theatre experience for the township of Montgomery, NJ and its surrounding areas. Founded in 2000, Sourland Hills Actors Guild was created by a group of grassroots volunteers who wanted to provide, both young and old, an opportunity to experience the performing arts. In our thirteen year history, Sourland Hills has produced twenty-five large-scale shows, and has grown from 40 actors and volunteers in our first production to 173 in our most recent show.<br/></p>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds so that we can continue to bring live theatre to the Montgomery Community. In the last 3 years, the rental fees for the performance space have increased 325%.  Achieving our goal of $8,000 will supplement our existing funds enough to cover the higher rental fees allow us to continue our mission to produce a full-length musical in the Spring of 2014.</p>

<p>What would you do if you knew that your life would change tomorrow, but you had no idea if it was for the better or the worse?  <i>The List </i>is a story about two best friends on the verge of change.  Mike and Jo have known each other almost their whole lives, but now they're worried that their friendship will transform into something different.  <i>The List</i> takes a non-linear journey through the lives of these two very quirky people from the moment they meet at seven years old, well into their golden years.  It is a story about the importance of friendship and how a single person can impact your entire life.  The audience is kept guessing as to what exactly is happening tomorrow, and as they see glimpses into the future of these friends, they continue to guess just how this story will end.</p>
<p><i>The List</i> began as a ten-minute play I wrote during an independent study course on playwriting in college.  When I wrote it, I knew that the story wasn't finished.  I knew that these two characters, Mike and Jo, had so much more to say.  After many attempts at trying to figure out the best way to approach it, I looked at a central part of the ten-minute play: Mike gives Jo a gift of a bucket list they'd made years earlier of all the things they want to do in their lives.  When I realized that the story should be told through these events, I had the play.  The list that these two create shows their innate humor and just how well they know each other.  They planned their lives together in the hope that they will always be there for one another.</p>
<p>I decided to tell their story non-linearly to give a broader view of their friendship.  Plus, it's a much larger challenge for the actors playing Mike and Jo to have to switch from 30 years old to 7 to 77.  In terms of the actors, I added two others as narrators of sorts, who jump in and out of Mike and Jo's lives as all the various characters they meet, from Jo's mother to Mike's childhood friend and beyond.It evolved into a full length play that has touched everyone who's read it.</p>
<p>At its heart, <i>The List </i>is a story about people, people who live, love, and have to make their way through the ups and downs that life brings.  It just so happens that these two particular people are a bit quirky and zany in their own ways.</p>
<p><strong>""I'm expecting a gold plated, jewel encrusted, life size ostrich.""</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, we are offering an array of rewards for our backers.  We're hoping that we can entice some people to help us out.  We would love to give more mementos from the show, but as it is very minimalistic, there are not many items in the way of props and set pieces.  Still, we are happy to do what we can.</p>
<p>Got a venue and want us to tell this story for you?  Take special note to the side; we can travel to you and perform this show for your group, community, or, if you're a rich eccentric type, just you.</p>
<p><strong>""Where has the time gone?  It seems like only yesterday you were playing in the mud.""</strong></p>
<p>Rehearsals for this show have been underway for a while now.  We have our Man and Woman, along with our various tech roles.  The show opens in just a few weeks, but we do need some help supporting this process.  We will be doing the show regardless of our funding, but it would certainly help improve it if the financial strain was lightened some.</p>
<p>We will open at the new Talking Horse Theatre located at 210 St. James Street in Columbia, Missouri.  Our production will run for 5 performances.  Opening night will have a special talkback session with the cast, crew, playwright, and director.  Our show dates are 09/27-09/28, 10/04-10/05 at 7:30 and 10/06 at 2:00</p>
<p><strong>""Thanks for stopping by!  I feel much butter!""</strong></p>
<p>Help make this world premiere a possibility!  We can't do this without you!  Remember, no money exchanges hands unless we meet our goal.  What have you got to lose?  Help a group of people who believe in this story have the chance to tell it and earn our eternal gratitude. </p>

<p><strong>""If I were a princess, some big catastrophe would happen right about now.""</strong></p>
<p>Anything involved in the arts is a risk.  Will people like it?  Can it succeed?  It's true that theatre is a risky business and people need to know their audiences.  I can say with certainty that everyone who has read <em>The List</em> has been moved by it.  I have been working on this script with the hope of getting it produced for almost two years and now it's almost come to fruition.  Columbia, Missouri, is small town known for it's support of the arts.  It has a lot for people to go and do or see, so we need to make it enticing for them to want to see this show.</p>
<p>We may be a new theatre company getting off the ground, but our members have long years of experience behind them.  I've been in theatre for the last twelve years and have numerous other plays under my belt.  Our director and co-founder of Original Oddity Productions has more years than she'd prefer to admit living and breathing the theatre life.  </p>
<p>Getting this together from start to finish has been a challenge in and of itself, but now the only thing keeping us from moving forward is money.  We have a great director, an accommodating venue with Talking Horse Productions, a minimal set to build, and a great story to tell.  Help us get this out there.</p>

<h3> </h3></span></span></div>","""Tomorrow everything changes.""
What would you do if you knew that your life would change tomorrow, but you had no idea if it was for the better or the worse?  The List is a story about two best friends on the verge of change.  Mike and Jo have known each other almost their whole lives, but now they're worried that their friendship will transform into something different.  The List takes a non-linear journey through the lives of these two very quirky people from the moment they meet at seven years old, well into their golden years.  It is a story about the importance of friendship and how a single person can impact your entire life.  The audience is kept guessing as to what exactly is happening tomorrow, and as they see glimpses into the future of these friends, they continue to guess just how this story will end.
The List began as a ten-minute play I wrote during an independent study course on playwriting in college.  When I wrote it, I knew that the story wasn't finished.  I knew that these two characters, Mike and Jo, had so much more to say.  After many attempts at trying to figure out the best way to approach it, I looked at a central part of the ten-minute play: Mike gives Jo a gift of a bucket list they'd made years earlier of all the things they want to do in their lives.  When I realized that the story should be told through these events, I had the play.  The list that these two create shows their innate humor and just how well they know each other.  They planned their lives together in the hope that they will always be there for one another.
I decided to tell their story non-linearly to give a broader view of their friendship.  Plus, it's a much larger challenge for the actors playing Mike and Jo to have to switch from 30 years old to 7 to 77.  In terms of the actors, I added two others as narrators of sorts, who jump in and out of Mike and Jo's lives as all the various characters they meet, from Jo's mother to Mike's childhood friend and beyond.It evolved into a full length play that has touched everyone who's read it.
At its heart, The List is a story about people, people who live, love, and have to make their way through the ups and downs that life brings.  It just so happens that these two particular people are a bit quirky and zany in their own ways.
""I'm expecting a gold plated, jewel encrusted, life size ostrich.""
As you can see, we are offering an array of rewards for our backers.  We're hoping that we can entice some people to help us out.  We would love to give more mementos from the show, but as it is very minimalistic, there are not many items in the way of props and set pieces.  Still, we are happy to do what we can.
Got a venue and want us to tell this story for you?  Take special note to the side; we can travel to you and perform this show for your group, community, or, if you're a rich eccentric type, just you.
""Where has the time gone?  It seems like only yesterday you were playing in the mud.""
Rehearsals for this show have been underway for a while now.  We have our Man and Woman, along with our various tech roles.  The show opens in just a few weeks, but we do need some help supporting this process.  We will be doing the show regardless of our funding, but it would certainly help improve it if the financial strain was lightened some.
We will open at the new Talking Horse Theatre located at 210 St. James Street in Columbia, Missouri.  Our production will run for 5 performances.  Opening night will have a special talkback session with the cast, crew, playwright, and director.  Our show dates are 09/27-09/28, 10/04-10/05 at 7:30 and 10/06 at 2:00
""Thanks for stopping by!  I feel much butter!""
Help make this world premiere a possibility!  We can't do this without you!  Remember, no money exchanges hands unless we meet our goal.  What have you got to lose?  Help a group of people who believe in this story have the chance to tell it and earn our eternal gratitude.

""If I were a princess, some big catastrophe would happen right about now.""
Anything involved in the arts is a risk.  Will people like it?  Can it succeed?  It's true that theatre is a risky business and people need to know their audiences.  I can say with certainty that everyone who has read The List has been moved by it.  I have been working on this script with the hope of getting it produced for almost two years and now it's almost come to fruition.  Columbia, Missouri, is small town known for it's support of the arts.  It has a lot for people to go and do or see, so we need to make it enticing for them to want to see this show.
We may be a new theatre company getting off the ground, but our members have long years of experience behind them.  I've been in theatre for the last twelve years and have numerous other plays under my belt.  Our director and co-founder of Original Oddity Productions has more years than she'd prefer to admit living and breathing the theatre life.  
Getting this together from start to finish has been a challenge in and of itself, but now the only thing keeping us from moving forward is money.  We have a great director, an accommodating venue with Talking Horse Productions, a minimal set to build, and a great story to tell.  Help us get this out there.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>""Changing the Lives of People One Step at a Time""</p>
<p><b>About </b><b><i>""The NJ Dance Network""</i></b></p>
<p>""The NJ Dance Network"" is a facility that will be located in the heart of downtown Newark, New Jersey. As an advocate of youth empowerment, a proud
recipient of a ""Key To The City"" and a mother, I embarked on this endeavor along with other distinguished community leaders to help deter children from getting into trouble with their idle time. With the staggering number of cases of youth-targeted
violence, I felt behooved to rise to the occasion. Once renovated, this
community center will function as a meeting ground for talented children of Newark as well as surrounding cities. It is my belief that an establishment such as
this one will appeal to the common thread most of our youth have here and that
is their love for dancing. The focus will be on dance in all
of its variations, representing an opportunity for more inner-city kids to
avoid urban pitfalls and receive formal training at no cost to our residents. Our goal is to develop full-scale dance recitals and theatrical productions.</p>
<p><b>About <i>“Hood House: So Jersey”</i> </b></p>
<p>Our first musical production will be a dance DVD in conjunction with a 3-4 song EP entitled <i>Hood House: So Jersey</i> tentatively scheduled for December 2013. The NJ Dance Network will be releasing a series of videos for the EP that will cast its participants. It is our hope that employing people directly from the community would be a great way to boost morale and offer them a chance to experience pop culture in a positive environment while utilizing his or her natural born talents.</p>
<p><b> About<i> “Breaking in the Brix”</i></b> </p>
<p><i>Breakin’ In the Brix </i>is the current working title for the first stage production for the NJ Dance Network. It is a musical remake of the 1984 classic movie “Breakin” to be performed at any one of Newark’s arts and entertainment venues such as the New Jersey Performing Arts Center or Newark Symphony Hall’s Terrace Ballroom. We are prepping to have it ready by Spring 2014. We will launch another fundraiser for this project sometime around January. I'm currently working on obtaining 501(c)(3) status so that all contributions are tax deductible. Until such time, I've been spending my own personal funds to make such a dream of mine come to fruition! </p>
<p><b><i>Where does the money go? </i></b> </p>
<p>Funds from this campaign will be used towards building renovations, producing the videos for the EP and making the preliminary preparations for our first stage production. There are hefty production costs as well as salaries for (but not specific to):  </p>
<p>• Scriptwriters • Choreographers • Videographers • Production hands • Producers • DJs • Set designers • Dancers • Recording Artists • Music supervisors • Instrument players • Costume designers • Vocal coaches • Youth advocates • Hair/Makeup artists • Team leaders  • Life coaches</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Every project has its risks. In our inner city communities, we are constantly losing young adults to street violence and domestic violence with minimal resources to help them. I have a personal stake in this so I'm willing to contribute any personal funds necessary to see this through ensuring all contributors' rewards are delivered in a timely manner. <br/>
Underneath all the grit and crime that you hear so much about on the news is a world of endlessly talented future leaders. We want to show kids that they can come from humble beginnings and create greatness for themselves and those around them. <br/>

The National Ballet Company and Institute for the Arts moved to a beautiful space in Annapolis in January 2013.  The new location, equipped with two ballet studios, offices, study rooms, costume storage, and art gallery, is ideal for the institute's dedication to dance and arts.  With its new home, the company seeks to enrich the Annapolis community and continue to provide outstanding performances and arts eduction to Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.


Your Contribution is Needed
National Ballet Institute for the Arts is a Maryland non profit corporation seeking to provide services to the community. 
In addition to superb ballet performances for the general public, the company works with schools to provide valuable arts education to children through performances and lecture-demonstrations.   Senior citizens benefit from performances brought to senior communities to provide accessible quality entertainment.  Adult classes are offered to encourage mobility and health at any age.
Your contribution will ensure the existence of affordable arts education, performances, and outreach programs in the arts for children, adults, senior citizens, and special needs groups throughout Maryland, Virginia and District of Columbia.
NBIA is offering perks to thank you for your valuable donations.  Every dollar is appreciated!


Other Ways You Can Help

Be sure to check the website for more information or to register for Summer and Fall classes.  Two Summer camps are also available: ""Let's Paint, Dance, and Make Music,"" a fun-filled day camp for ages 5-12, and the ""Maestro Enrico Cecchetti Intensive"" for ballet students who are studying the Cecchetti Method or are interested in exploring the method.

</p><h3>What is Rhapsody Collective?</h3>
<p>About a year ago, I had a dream of bringing a group of young
artists together to create new works from the very beginning and devise plays
under one common theme.  Well, 36 artists
were brought together and we presented six plays with the theme of Dreams. After a successful run of sold-out, one-night only presentations,
a new ensemble of artists, containing both old and new members, came together
and we’re eager to share seven new plays with you. This Cycle’s theme: <b>The
Seven Deadly Sins</b>. </p>
<p><b>Rhapsody Collective</b>
is a group of young theater artists dedicated to creating new works from the
ground up. Rhapsody Collective strives to foster new and innovative ideas in a
safe environment of peers. The goal is to create, not produce. Over the course
of a cycle, the ensemble of actors, directors, playwrights, and dramaturgs are
randomly broken up into teams to create a brand new piece. The challenge for
each team is “freedom within restrictions.” Each cycle has a theme each piece
must incorporate. Additionally, the roles created must be written specifically
for the actors on their team. At the end of the cycle, each play will be
presented in one harmonious rhapsody. </p>
<p>Since October, we have met as an ensemble to learn about who
we are as individual theater artists. We have now been divided into our 7 Seven
Deadly Sin Teams and have been steadily devising our seven diverse plays. We
can’t wait to show just how sinful we are in Cycle 2! </p>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help:</h3>
<p>In order to bring our seven pieces to life, we need your
help. This May, we will present our seven teams’ plays in workshop style. Our
goal is to charge a suggested donation as admission so you can see all seven
presentations and not feel you have to pick and choose. And that’s why you’re
here! The more we raise, the bigger the space, the more people we can share our
work with!</p>
<p>We need to raise funds to:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Rent rehearsal spaces for all of the seven teams</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Rent a week-long residency space at the new home
of Alchemical Theatre Laboratory</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Print programs </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Order and print postcards and posters </p>
<p>If we exceed our goal (which would be awesome!), those funds
will go to future Rhapsody Collective projects and the start of Cycle 3 in the
Fall of 2014! Just look at all the perks you could collect just by donating to
Rhapsody Collective! </p>

<h3>Help create and sustain ""Life""!</h3>
<p>Damsels in De-Stress Productions invites you to experience <strong>Life x 3 </strong>by Yasmina Reza at Unit 102 Theatre.</p>
<p>Henry and Sonia are (unsuccessfully) putting their 6-year-old son to bed when Henry’s bombastic colleague Hubert and his wife Inez show up to dinner – a day earlier than expected.  Ever resourceful, Henry and Sonia serve up a confection of cheezits, chocolate fingers, and pistachios washed down with copious amounts of Sancerre – but the evening quickly disintegrates.   Over the course of the play, the audience is treated to three versions of this comically disastrous evening.  You’ll laugh, you’ll cringe, and you’ll have to stop at the corner store to pick up a bag of cheezits on the way home.</p>
<p>Directed by Andrew Lamb (<em>My Mother’s Lesbian Jewish Wiccan Wedding</em>), the cast features Tara Baxendale, Rob McKee, Sean Tabares and Esther Thibault.  <strong>Life x 3</strong> is an Equity Artist Collective production.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Of course what we really hope happens is that you get yourself over to Unit 102 Theatre, 376 Dufferin Street, between May 2 - May 11 and see our show.  Tickets are only $25 - and $20 if you're a student, a senior or an artsworker!</p>
<p>But maybe you live out of town - or you have a little extra cash burning a hole in your pocket - and you'd like to help us out by making an advance contribution to our production budget.  And in exchange, you get our undying gratitude, the satisfaction of knowing you're an arts patron, and a fun perk or two.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Even though this is an Equity Artist Collective (which means our actors and our artistic team are deferring their salaries in exchange for a share of the profits), it still costs a lot of money to put on a play.  We have to pay for the rights, rent performance space, rent rehearsal space, pay for publicity - the list goes on and on.  Esther and I hope that Damsels in De-Stress Productions will be around to bring you fun, affordable, contemporary theatre for many years to come - but this is our first production and we need YOUR help!</p>
<p>Our biggest cost is renting space for rehearsal and performance.  $2000 would cover a significant portion of those costs.</p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially to our campaign right now, you can still help us make Life x 3 a success: use the Indiegogo share tools to help us get the word out about this campaign - and about our show!</p>

</h3> <p></p>
</div><p>GASP (Girls Assembling Something Perpetual) was founded by six female
 poets in Denver, Colorado in 2011. Combining elements of the sparse and
 often absent stage direction with dance, improvisation, and 
interpretation, GASP creates a poets’ theater of part abstraction, part 
sublimity, part accident, and part gesture. GASP seeks to find ways 
within theater, within a “play,” to parallel, not translate, radical 
elicitations of text, body, and atmosphere. To speak as both mouth and 
limb simultaneously.</p>
<p>For their next project, GASP will perform Alice Notley’s <a href=""http://www.gasptheater.org/the-descent-of-alette/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The Descent of Alette</i></a>. Previously, GASP performed <a href=""http://www.gasptheater.org/sweet/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Leslie Scalapino’s <i>Sweet: A Play</i></a>
 using her minimal stage direction to examine aspects of the politicized
 body, war, and groupthink. Their performance of  four short plays from <a href=""http://www.gasptheater.org/stein/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gertrude Stein’s <i>Geography and Plays</i></a> explored language, love, feminism, gender roles, and play through essential and explosive performances.</p><p>GASP performers for <i>The Descent of Alette</i> include Alexis Almeida, Sommer Browning, Serena Chopra, Yanara Friedland, HR Hegnauer, and Andrea Rexilius.  </p><div>

<h3>Funding</h3>GASP is seeking funding of $2500. This will help cover the costs of our 2015 performances, which will take place in Los Angeles, Denver, Boulder, and Colorado Springs.

I've always admired Frank’s brilliant style, and last year, it occurred to me to write a show in his honor. After the successful Hollywood opening of “Lucky So and So,” my homage to the great Duke Ellington, something told me to follow up with another show. I started reading about Frank and was floored by his dynamic life, right from the moment of his perilous birth! The more I read, the more I saw how well certain songs he sang narrated his lofty highs and devastating lows. He always spoke his mind, inspiring the show’s title, ""Let Me Be Frank!"" Though he made singing seem easy, Frank worked tirelessly to hone his craft, aware very early on that he was headed for greatness. </h3>
<h3>After nearly a year of writing, the show is ready for rehearsals. That’s where you come in, to assist me in getting the show on its feet! This show warrants great musicians and they charge for their services. We’ll begin with piano rehearsals and commission unique, precise charts for all arrangements in the appropriate keys.</h3>
<h3>Soon, we’ll start booking club dates, printing promotional materials and listing the show on prominent web sites. There will be meetings with an Arts attorney to make sure that everyone who created this great music is honored. To me, the music Frank sang is some of the best music ever written. My mission is to disseminate this music to the emerging generations, along with the history of how it was created and by whom. The show will begin in small local clubs and expand into live theater venues nationwide, including Las Vegas and New York, then onto the International scene! The show is written so other musical actors can take on the role, increasing its scope indefinitely.</h3>
<h3>Your enthusiasm for this project inspires me and the perks will make this process more fun for both of us. Perks include show tickets for local supporters and signed posters, post cards and customized musical greetings to those who live outside the Los Angeles area. Angelo is an established visual artist and an art image will be created, highlighting the show's theme. Prints of this artwork will be available in large 11"" x 14"" and small 8.5"" x 11"" sizes. All Prints, poster and Post Cards will be signed by Angelo. All perks will be available on 12/12/12, Frank's birthday! You may support at any dollar amount you choose and all who pitch in will be thanked for their support. For those who cannot contribute, you can help by spreading the word and getting friends and family to pitch in. Using the Indiegogo share tools makes it easy!

</div></div>","*UPDATE*
Our premiere of Telepresence on December 17th went swimmingly! The HTC served up a dynamic mixture of electrifying sounds, fresh moves, and captivating imagery, leaving Charlotte audiences buzzing with energy, asking thoughtful questions, and effectively provoked! We cannot wait to be back in the creative process, continuing to dig deeper in developing this work, and seeing everyone again for our Spring premiere!

The Low-Down:

The Human Triptych Collective (HTC) is a group of independent artists comprised of dancers, musicians, and visual artists. For our current project, Telepresence, we are creating a multi-media performance art piece that features live music, live dance, and visualizations that focuses on the social effects of social media and communication technology usage. The performance explores society's current philosophy of technology and encourages viewers to consider the manner in which technologies shape everyday life. 

With our unique and wholly collaborative blend of performance art, we are interested in removing our work from concert halls and traditional fine arts venues, and bringing it directly to our audiences into unexpected and accessible spaces.


The subject of Telepresence looks at how our human to human experience is augmented by the pervasiveness of modern technologies. In exploring such dense and complex ideas, we are committed to continuing it's development beyond our premiere performance. 



The second installment of Telepresence is slated for mid-April at a newly-opened bar and music venue in Charlotte, NC.

This is where we performed in December 2011:
THE EVENING MUSE, Charlotte, NC




We have also performed:

The Orange Peel, Asheville, NC



The Neighborhood Theatre, Charlotte, NC




What We Need: 
So making good work with a lot of fabulous artists (14 to be exact) comes with a hefty price-tag. We are creating this campaign in hopes to cover only a FRACTION of our actual expenses...

In continuing to develop Telepresence, our goal is to raise funds for the purpose of space rental. This is a two fold expense which firstly includes renting a consistent rehearsal space, that can accommodate both dancers and our musicians. It's imperative for the musicians and dancers to be in the same space during the creative process so that the collaboration between the two is genuine and in the moment. Secondly, we need to rent the venues in which we perform. We carefully choose spaces, primarily bars and music venues, that will expose a crowd that might not otherwise find themselves dashing off to the ballet.


BUDGET BREAKDOWN:

Rehearsal space: $20/hr x 12 week rehearsal period = $1300
Performance space: Avg. overhead for music venues = $500

Lift up the couch cushions and throw some change in our direction! 
You can be sure your dollars are providing a foundation for change 
in the arts community in Charlotte, NC. 
Our budget does not include artist's stipends or paychecks!
You're looking at a group of creative individuals
who
are making work out of passion and creative necessity,
but need your generous donation 
of 

$1  $5 $100

to make things happen.

Thanks, ya'll!

<h2>OUR STORY</h2>
<p><strong>Hello,Nikk Alcaraz and our theatre group is called Darling Starr Productions. Our group was formed in late 2011 with a production of the Rocky Horror Show. Our purpose of the group is to grow as young artists and learn what it is to produce, direct and budget a show built from the ground up. We start fundraising for our shows as soon as January for a show in June. Our cast holds bake sales, car washes, raffles and sells advertisements in our programs to businesses around Santa Fe, New Mexico. We are recently going to put on a production of The Little Shop of Horrors this summer 2013. For every production we put on, we meet new faces and participants. Joining the group all depends on what production we are doing. This year we will have at least 10 cast members and 5 crew members. Our casts age usually ranges from 16-25 and we are all grateful that Darling Starr Productions is in action. There are so many people in Santa Fe that have been waiting for an opportunity like Darling Starr Productions to come along, and I am honored to be a part of this opportunity. Darling Starr Productions usually has all of its shows at Warehouse 21 every summer. Our most recent show was RENT, the musical. We all overcame huge challenges and struggles before and during RENT production. The end result of RENT was rewarding, it caught a lot of wind from the media. We couldn't have started this group without the support from our community</strong>.</p>

Hello,Nikk Alcaraz and our theatre group is called Darling Starr Productions. Our group was formed in late 2011 with a production of the Rocky Horror Show. Our purpose of the group is to grow as young artists and learn what it is to produce, direct and budget a show built from the ground up. We start fundraising for our shows as soon as January for a show in June. Our cast holds bake sales, car washes, raffles and sells advertisements in our programs to businesses around Santa Fe, New Mexico.

<p><em><strong>Hello Mappsters and new supporters! Below is a brief description of our 30 day campaign and a personal story. This is an important moment in the history of MAPP. With the new relationship to our fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas, we can now raise important funding for new development and expansion of our exciting work!  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. I am looking forward to this!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Tom Kellogg </em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Campaign: May- June 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need $30,000* to put immediately into project development and preproduction toward MAPP programs in the 2013/14 school year with the Coeur D' Alene Tribe, the Nez Perce Tribe, and cross-cultural (native, refugee, latino, LGBT) MAPP projects in Boise, Idaho.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All of these community partners are currently pursuing funding for MAPP programs through tribal grants, arts foundation grants, and regional business sponsorships. Your support here, will allow us to assist this process, make commitments to key community partners, as well as stay focused on planning and scheduling of MAPP programs and participants into the next school calendar year. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This funding will also help us to re-establish development with our community partners in Oregon, California, Alaska, and British Columbia. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This funding will be critical to building a solid base from which to reach out to new communities who have requested our help to bring MAPP to their reservations or urban centers throughout the country and abroad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>* To make $30,000, we set a goal of $33,333, because 7%  goes to  Fractured Atlas for fiscal sponsorship responsibilities. The other 93% will go toward MAPP production costs.   </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>now, if and when you have the time, please read below...</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The MAPP Story:</p>
<p>It is just after 4 am… Too early for coffee. I got out of bed with so many thoughts about how to talk about this amazing work I’ve been involved in for 20 years now… I know it is the most authentic thing I have ever done. It seems to be as simple at times as gathering a group of adults, stepping into a circle in a room with a group of young people and spending some very special time listening to each other… and that’s where the magic happens…</p>
<p><strong>and what is this magic exactly? Well, its those moments when a young person tells you a story that breaks your heart, or makes you laugh, or gives you an insight into her dreams, and how she sees the world… powerful stuff… epic really. If you have been in that room you know what I am talking about… it never leaves you… that is the power of this creative work. It makes the unseen visible. It heals us… Yes, that is the word I have heard many times over in community, from parents, and elders, and teachers, and artists. This work heals <em>us</em>… bringing our children into the circle makes us, as a people, whole again…</strong></p>
<p>Then we get this other benefit that comes with the work. We get to take these young people and their dramatic stories and we get to share them with the world… And all over again, the magic is there in the room…  Once again,<strong> the voices of our young people are honored, through the performances of adults sitting there on stage only a few feet away from the young writer, conveying the poetry and deep song…  everyone melded at the heart… and the audiences are changed, because they are witnessing a birth really… and they are connected to a basic human need, the need to connect at the level of spirit, a need often glossed over by the rush of the mundane reality…</strong></p>
<p>So this is the aspiration and the narrative that has carried me for 20 years now. This is the passion that took me out of the more seemingly comfortable confines of my life in Los Angeles into juvenile lock down facilities, drug rehab centers, and orphanages throughout the country. This is the desire that gave me the courage to reach beyond seemingly impossible barriers to work on Native American Reservations and in urban Native centers all over North America… this is the need that has led me to some of the most recent heart- stirring work with multicultural community including recent refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Congo, Somalia, and Zimbabwe… with Latino youth… with LGBT youth… with young people, some who have learning disabilities, but also spirits and imaginations as big and powerful as the universe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many of you have been there with me, over the years, in the room. So many people have supported this precious work. Sometimes it is hard to believe we have achieved what we have… So many dialogues, at times late into the night, about how amazing these young people are. So many talks, and planning meetings, and work sessions, and rehearsals, and celebrations…  it feels good to have this history. It feels good to experience people on this level. It feels good to have friendships that are connected to this cause.</p>
<p><strong>MAPP has always been structured to make its community partners the owners and driving force of the project… In other words, MAPP works for its communities.</strong> Because of this, so many of our community partners continue to seek and provide essential financial support and in-kind contributions. But the fact is, the economic crisis over the past 4 years has kept MAPP from developing in the places where we have already created a vibrant , exciting tradition.  And we have not been able to respond fully to the multiple requests from marginalized communities all over the country, who have asked us to help them develop ongoing MAPP programming, which will allow them to do the healing work we can do through this program.</p>
<p>It may sound strange, but during this time of extreme belt tightening, I have actually been focused on expansion. <strong>I’d like to see the development of a MAPP institute: A training center for mentor artists, educators, and community developers. A place where the pulse of what we do, can be felt and transferred to the next generation.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I am hoping you will become a visible part of the MAPP community through our Facebook page, the MAPP blog, or if possible, as a mentor in one of our programs.</em></strong></p>

<p>TALA is back for a second workshop production at HERE’s Summer Sublet Series, July 28-31<sup>st</sup>, 2012, and we need to raise $5,000 to make it happen! Your donations will help us provide artist stipends, pay our design and technical crew, and support our production costs.</p>
<p>TALA is a meta-theatrical play that merges the playwright’s autobiography with the story of Pepe and Lupe, two lovers caught on the Chilean island of Chiloé the night before Pinochet’s military coup. Collaging satirical sketches based on Samuel Beckett’s works, letters and poems written by Chilean poets Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral, and autobiographical monologues, TALA explores the surreal parallels between life, performance, and the creation of art as an act of revolution.</p>
<p>TALA is the first production written and directed by Kyoung H. Park as Artistic Director of Pacific Beat Collective. Pacific Beat Collective (PBC) is a multi-cultural collective of artists creating interdisciplinary works of original theater that explore our world’s interconnectedness. We believe that theater has the power to bridge cultural differences and serve as a tool for non-violent social change. Through art and dialogue, our work questions oppressive social structures and promotes a culture of peace, by radically de-stabilizing normative assumptions that cause direct and structural violence in the world.</p>

<h3>Who We Are<br/>
</h3>
<div id=""about-text"">
<p>Cowardly Kiss Theatre was founded in February of 2006 by writer/director Andrea Beça in 
order to produce her works at the Edmonton International Fringe Theatre 
Festival. <br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/></span></p>
<p> After four successful festival productions at the Edmonton Fringe, Cowardly Kiss took a huge leap to produce its first fully independent play, <em>BUNBURYING</em>,
 written as Andrea's Master's in Playwriting thesis at the University of
 Glasgow, Scotland. The play, which was produced at the Transalta Arts Barns in the Spring of 2011, was very well-received by the Edmonton theatre community, and was recently named the ""most audacious idea for a new play"" by Edmonton Journal reviewer Liz Nicholls. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This summer, Cowardly Kiss is thrilled to be returning to the Edmonton Fringe with a play unlike any other.<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span> Joan. Edie. Joyce. Carolyn. Joan. Elise... Inspired by the lives 
of the women of the Beat Generation<span style=""font-style: italic;"">, (Real) Gone (Girl)</span> is more than a play - it's a theatrical experience for everyone involved, including the actresses, who will be exposed to the script word by word, live on stage on the night of their performances, just like the audience. Each actress will perform the script once. Each audience will see <span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Real) Gone (Girl)</span> once. No two performances (or performers) will be the same.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here's what people are saying about Cowardly Kiss and its productions:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>""Here's a little company that's definitely got something going on."" - <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Edmonton Journal</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>""Impressively audiacious."" - <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Edmonton Journal</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>This Campaign<br/>
</h3>
<p>As an independent theatre artist, I run Cowardly Kiss Theatre on a completely out-of-pocket basis. This means that every show I've produced since 2007 has been put on my credit cards (sometimes split between a few of them!) in hopes that I'll be able to pay them off with ticket sales. But beyond paying my own bills, it has always been my goal, first and foremost, to be able to provide my cast and crew with a paycheque (no matter how humble) to show them how much I value the countless hours of ""blood, sweat, and tears"" hard work they put into my plays. We as artists all have to start somewhere, often working for free, or even paying to work. I understand that, and I've been there. Sometimes I still <span style=""font-style: italic;"">am</span> there. Which is why I strive to do the best I can by my cast and crew. <span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Real) Gone (Girl)</span> is no different, and due to its nature (of having a different performer for each night of the production), it's a large cast and crew - there are 10 incredible, beautiful, committed theatre practitioners involved, doing everything from acting and stage management to choreography and dramaturgy. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What <span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Real) Gone (Girl) </span>Needs From You<br/>
</h3>
<p>Let's be frank: in theatre - especially festival theatre like the Fringe, where there are so many different plays to choose from - there are no guarantees of ticket sales, even with five-star reviews. In order to ensure that Cowardly Kiss Theatre stays on top of its finances, and can therefore continue to make audacious, thought-provoking theatre, we need to raise $2,000 to help cover the majority of the costs of this production. The simple truth is that if we don't raise that much, we're less likely to make profit at the Fringe, leaving me unable to pay my cast and crew. If we raise more, we're that much closer to profit, I can pay everyone involved, and I can move forward with my company and all of its future projects (which includes a web series coming late summer 2011 and a series of plays in 2012). I've been blessed (and lucky) to never have to stop making art, and I hope that with your help, I'll never have to.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can only donate $10 to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Real) Gone (Girl)</span>, you'll be making a difference for our production, and there are numerous other ways you can help, too. Please pass this campaign along to everyone you know - spread the word through email, Facebook, Twitter, however you can! <br/></p>

</div></div>","Who We Are


Cowardly Kiss Theatre was founded in February of 2006 by writer/director Andrea Beça in 
order to produce her works at the Edmonton International Fringe Theatre 
Festival. 

 After four successful festival productions at the Edmonton Fringe, Cowardly Kiss took a huge leap to produce its first fully independent play, BUNBURYING,
 written as Andrea's Master's in Playwriting thesis at the University of
 Glasgow, Scotland. The play, which was produced at the Transalta Arts Barns in the Spring of 2011, was very well-received by the Edmonton theatre community, and was recently named the ""most audacious idea for a new play"" by Edmonton Journal reviewer Liz Nicholls. 

This summer, Cowardly Kiss is thrilled to be returning to the Edmonton Fringe with a play unlike any other. Joan. Edie. Joyce. Carolyn. Joan. Elise... Inspired by the lives 
of the women of the Beat Generation, (Real) Gone (Girl) is more than a play - it's a theatrical experience for everyone involved, including the actresses, who will be exposed to the script word by word, live on stage on the night of their performances, just like the audience. Each actress will perform the script once. Each audience will see (Real) Gone (Girl) once. No two performances (or performers) will be the same.

Here's what people are saying about Cowardly Kiss and its productions:

""Here's a little company that's definitely got something going on."" - The Edmonton Journal

""Impressively audiacious."" - The Edmonton Journal



This Campaign

As an independent theatre artist, I run Cowardly Kiss Theatre on a completely out-of-pocket basis. This means that every show I've produced since 2007 has been put on my credit cards (sometimes split between a few of them!) in hopes that I'll be able to pay them off with ticket sales. But beyond paying my own bills, it has always been my goal, first and foremost, to be able to provide my cast and crew with a paycheque (no matter how humble) to show them how much I value the countless hours of ""blood, sweat, and tears"" hard work they put into my plays. We as artists all have to start somewhere, often working for free, or even paying to work. I understand that, and I've been there. Sometimes I still am there. Which is why I strive to do the best I can by my cast and crew. 

(Real) Gone (Girl) is no different, and due to its nature (of having a different performer for each night of the production), it's a large cast and crew - there are 10 incredible, beautiful, committed theatre practitioners involved, doing everything from acting and stage management to choreography and dramaturgy. 


What (Real) Gone (Girl) Needs From You

Let's be frank: in theatre - especially festival theatre like the Fringe, where there are so many different plays to choose from - there are no guarantees of ticket sales, even with five-star reviews. In order to ensure that Cowardly Kiss Theatre stays on top of its finances, and can therefore continue to make audacious, thought-provoking theatre, we need to raise $2,000 to help cover the majority of the costs of this production. The simple truth is that if we don't raise that much, we're less likely to make profit at the Fringe, leaving me unable to pay my cast and crew. If we raise more, we're that much closer to profit, I can pay everyone involved, and I can move forward with my company and all of its future projects (which includes a web series coming late summer 2011 and a series of plays in 2012). I've been blessed (and lucky) to never have to stop making art, and I hope that with your help, I'll never have to.


Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can only donate $10 to (Real) Gone (Girl), you'll be making a difference for our production, and there are numerous other ways you can help, too. Please pass this campaign along to everyone you know - spread the word through email, Facebook, Twitter, however you can! 
And when the 2011 Edmonton Fringe Festival rolls around (August 11-21, 2011), please come out to see (Real) Gone (Girl) at the Westbury Theatre! Our performance (and performer) schedule is as follows:

August 11 @ 8pm - performed by Sarah HorsmanAugust 13 @ 6:15pm - performed by Elisa BenzerAugust 16 @ 12:15pm - performed by Mari ChartierAugust 18 @ 4:45pm - performed by Georgia IrwinAugust 19 @ 11pm - performed by Louise LargeAugust 21 @ 2:15pm - performed by Delia Barnett

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: medium;"">Hi! I'm Allison Lerman-Gluck, a Division III (senior) student at Hampshire College studying Theatre, Education, and Community Building. For my thesis project, I'm directing a production of 'The Fantasticks' by Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt at Hampshire College. This show will be a study in collaboration and ensemble/community building, with Hampshire students working hand-in-hand with Amherst Regional High School students. Both the acting team and the design/production team of the show will be comprised of Hampshire AND ARHS students. This show is a great opportunity for myself, the 25+ other people who will be working on it, and the Hampshire/ARHS communities to open the lines of communication between ARHS and Hampshire, so that we can start utilizing each other as members of the same community and as theatrical/educational resources. </span></font></p>

Little do they know, the fathers have started this pretend 'feud' in order to bring their children together- acting under the belief that parents can manipulate their children simply by saying 'no.' To bring the families together, the fathers develop an elaborate ruse (with the help of El Gallo) that establishes Matt as a dramatic hero. However, their plans go sour when the children find out that they were manipulated.  <br/><br/>This is a story about finding the recipe to love, about age-ism, about power dynamics, about family relationships, about building and dismantling archetypes.

Est. delivery April 2012. Listen to some of Cathartech's sonic munitions here.


Email address: Technically, an email forwarding address. Incense/oil: Approx. 0.5 to 0.75 oz. (~50 mL) of loose incense, or 1 full dram of oil. Est. delivery July 2012. Click here to read well-deserved praise for Rosarium Blends products.


PCB artifact: 6Ã—6 in. printed-circuit-board artifact designed by Dakota Crane and etched, numbered, and ritually consecrated by Joshua Madara. Includes instructions for use. Est. delivery July 2012. See samples of Dakota's sigil machines here.


Talismachine: 8Ã—10 in. interactive (and hackable) electronic art print. You can actually connect the print to your computer and communicate with it, reprogram it, whatever. Here is an example of an earlier Talismachine of lesser quality (yours will have a microcontroller and more components). Est. delivery July 2012. Art: All artists will be required to digitally sign a magical contract nullifying the power of the sigil in the event that its true intent is malicious or inappropriate to the ritual the sigil was created for.

Ordination: In person if you can travel to Seattle, otherwise via Skype or similar. Robot: Est. delivery December 2012.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who We Are and What We're All About</h3>
<p>Jazz Squared Theatre is a new Toronto based Company committed to creating and nurturing Canadian Musical Theatre.</p>
<p>Our first project is The Beaver Den: A New Canadian Musical. Set in 1999 at the wake of children’s entertainment, The Beaver Den follows a cast of young actors “stuck” on a kid’s TV show filmed in the Muskoka Region.</p>
<p>Meet a cast of ridiculous characters including a Keanu-Reeves-obsessed actor, a Princess of Plaid, a Coca-Cola-addicted star, and a puppeteer struggling with his inner-beaver.</p>
<p>Please help us raise funds to mount our show at the Lower Ossington Theatre which premieres October 10th, 2012.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Mounting a musical theatre show has more hidden costs than a bad phone bill. The money we raise will first be used to pay off the space itself. We have to perform somewhere! Next there's the set and costumes. Our set is pretty minimal but still costly, and no actor wants to go on stage naked...well, maybe some actors. Another cost is our adorable Beavy puppet. He's cute and high maintanance. </p>
<p>Your generous donations, no matter how big or small, are all extremely appreciated. If you look to the right of this blurb you will see many perks offered for different donation amounts. Some of these perks include hugs, tickets, music, etc... </p>
<p>If you make any donation over $25, please email us with your full name and the amount you donated. Our email adress is located at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>We know there is a possibility of not reaching our goal. All of the funds contributed, however, will be used and appreciated. We will also still be distributing the perks. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand if you can't contribute financially. But if you want to contribute in another way, we won't complain! Here are some ways:</p>
<p>Tell your friends, family, and strangers about the show! Nothing works better than word of mouth. </p>
<p>There is also a ""share"" option at the bottom of this page for Facebook, Twitter, etc. Or copy and paste the link in an email. Or is that too old school?</p>
<p>If you are a business or have a knack with crafts, art, or baking, donations of items can be excepted for fundraising campaigns. Please email us if you're interested. </p>
<p>Also, if you'd like to volunteer time we might need help with the set-up/take-down, building, and on show nights. </p>
<p>And, of course, come see the show! Nothing beats an audience to perform to!</p>
<p>Any questions, email us at <a href=""mailto:jazzsquared@hotmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jazzsquared@hotmail.com</a>. Thank you so much! See you at the Den!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***Any perks that involve adding names or advertisements to the program cannot be completed as of Friday, October 5th as the programs have already been printed. We are sorry for the inconvenience.***</p>

<h3>Why Poe?</h3>
<p>Edgar Allan Poe's work spans the range of human emotions - from love, joy, and passion to jealousy, paranoia, rage and, of course, fear. With uncanny perception and unflinching honesty, Poe's writing is able to get at our most primal instincts. When Poe holds up the mirror to society, we at first suspect that we are staring back at a carnival funhouse reflection. With dawning comprehension, we realize with horror that his mirror is perhaps far more realistic than we dare believe. That which we truly fear is not being lost in the dark, but the darkness inside of our own hearts and minds.</p>
<h3><strong>We Need Your Help!</strong></h3>

<p><strong></strong>For most of his life, the iconic mustache was absent. Only in the much darker, desperate, final years did he grow that romantic, brooding facial hair and begin to go mad.</p>

The diverse classes and workshops are aimed at educating not just in movement and music but also in cultural and historical understanding. I have been dancing with Kim since 2006 and can truly say that without her guidance, teaching, and support, I would not be half the dancer I am today. All levels of experience and ALL shapes and sizes are welcome to join in the party, and this is rare in today's Photoshop culture. The program is intended to encourage growth, no matter what your current ability is. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, it was the program at this studio that helped me get through my treatment and become whole again during my recovery. I LOVE participating at a studio where the staff is concerned about a student's total well-being, not just her pants size! - DM


Why it's important...Securing regular rehearsal space for Groove Merchant has been the main goal of operating the studio.  Through our classes and projects we meet so many inspiring people as we provide a creative home for offering culture specific dance & drum classes, dance fitness programs and community events that celebrate and encourage creative and personal growth.  We are grateful for the studio family and all of the talents, friendship and experience they bring.  The studio is a creative home and retreat for so many people.Our obstacle...From 2005 through 2011 the studio has operated in retail space, which tends to be rather expensive.  Expenses keep rising and we are limited in the possibility for creating more income to support the overhead because we are restricted to having room for only one studio.Two things would allow us to keep providing classes and keep the studio going:
Having two studios
and reduced rent in a non-retail space.

As luck would have it...that opportunity has been presented to us and we need to act now!  The new space is less than a half of a mile from  our current location  and this new space will open up tremendous opportunities for additional  projects and expanded class offerings.How You Can Help?We need some help moving...yes, physically and financially.  We know this is going to be a work in progress and we'd love for you to be part of making it all happen.Our needs are many but these are the most important two:
$700 to move our dance studio mirrors (fingers crossed they make it in one piece to the new location)
$5200 for a dance floor

This would allow us the opportunity  to continue to provide the quality instruction and programs for which we have become known . We still need help with cost of paint; decor; new signage; all the added expenses of start up with new utilities; a stereo for the second studio; additional office set up and general advertising to get the word out that we've moved and have more to offer ...the list goes on.  Help us reach our initial goal and maybe a little more to give us leg up.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>This is Extant Arts' 4th year filling New York City parks with free, accessible Shakespeare.  Extant Arts is a small, hard-working band of theatre artists and professionals who have made it their mission to bring to life classic plays in ways that are fresh, open, and - most of all - fun!!<br/></p>
<p>In previous years the start-up costs of Extant's Summer Shakespeare Series have been funded by the artists themselves (that's right - us), but because of the infamous economic downturn, we need to rely on you - our friends, families, strangers, and audience - to help us make this play!  (And your donations are tax-deductible!)<br/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Over the past three summers, Extant has shared six Shakespeare plays with hundreds of park-goers across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.  <br/><br/>What we love most about our summer shows is the audience: where else can you see The Public's season ticket holders sitting on the grass next to Swedish-speaking tourists, passing dog-walkers sharing strawberries with a group of picnicking 30-somethings? Most of all, we love to cultivate a new generation of theater-goers.  From the five-year-old who accidentally wandered through the opening of THE TEMPEST to the rag-tag team of 12-year olds who, by the end of RICHARD III, were cheering on the War of the Roses as the battle raged on all sides.</div><div>
<br/>Even as we strive for accessibility, we are dedicated to capturing the craft and spirit of the Bard. We perform without mics, in natural light for an audience out to enjoy a sunny afternoon.<br/><p><br/></p>

<h3>""An Hour Without TV"" (Una Hora Sin Television)</h3>
<p>My name is Mariana Campos and I'm an actress and theater producer from Venezuela. I recently fell in love and got married to an amazing Bostonian man and moved to the United States. We currently live in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
<p>I have always been passionate about women's issues. I'm delighted to see all these social movements that are currently happening in the world and I feel very inspired to do my part to contribute artistically to these movements.</p>
<p>As women, we should uplift and unite in order to make changes. Those changes have to start within ourselves and this play intends to do just that with an unexpected ending that will raise questions instead of giving definite answers.</p>
<p>The play talks about a couple (Edward and Patricia) who's ""celebrating"" their 10th wedding anniversary and Patricia wants one hour to talk without any distractions. Throughout this hour, all hidden (and not so hidden) truths begin to be exposed, all leading up to an unexpected ending.</p>
<p>Our artistic goal with this project is to denounce in a visual manner the physical and psychological abuse that some women can go through with their partners. Women should not feel abused, diminished or threatened in any relationship, but it's more common than not. That's why it's important to denounce these toxic and unhealthy patterns. That is the purpose of this play.</p>
<p>By contributing to this play, you will be part of a movement that aims to help women break free from violence, abuse, mistreatment and feeling psychologically imprisoned in relationships.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">This project is valuable to the world because as citizens we need to shed a light on the issues that matter to us. The world right now is paying close attention to women's issues so it's our turn to be heard to make a difference. Each one of us can do it from our own perspective, and my perspective is an artistic one so from the stage I'm taking a stand for this cause.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong>In 2014, thanks to all my friends and family who believe in me and my work, I was able to produce another play through this IndieGoGo platform called ""Aqui No Paga Nadie"" and as most of you know, it was a great success thanks to you and your collaboration! At that time, we were able to spread the message of hope and shed a light on injustice by a government that was and still is oppressing their people, and that message thankfully came across by being so well received by the audience in Venezuela. </strong> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Now, I ask for your help again to allow us to cast light on this issue that has caused so many unnecessary deaths and pain within families. With your donation, this play can make someone who suffers from abuse to gain strength to fight for a better life.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making art is not an easy task because of the economy we live in, but when that's your calling in life you don't stop until you have given it your all in order to make dreams happen. </p>

My name is Mariana Campos and I'm an actress and theater producer from Venezuela. I recently fell in love and got married to an amazing Bostonian man and moved to the United States. We currently live in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
I have always been passionate about women's issues. I'm delighted to see all these social movements that are currently happening in the world and I feel very inspired to do my part to contribute artistically to these movements.
As women, we should uplift and unite in order to make changes. Those changes have to start within ourselves and this play intends to do just that with an unexpected ending that will raise questions instead of giving definite answers.
The play talks about a couple (Edward and Patricia) who's ""celebrating"" their 10th wedding anniversary and Patricia wants one hour to talk without any distractions. Throughout this hour, all hidden (and not so hidden) truths begin to be exposed, all leading up to an unexpected ending.
Our artistic goal with this project is to denounce in a visual manner the physical and psychological abuse that some women can go through with their partners. Women should not feel abused, diminished or threatened in any relationship, but it's more common than not. That's why it's important to denounce these toxic and unhealthy patterns. That is the purpose of this play.
By contributing to this play, you will be part of a movement that aims to help women break free from violence, abuse, mistreatment and feeling psychologically imprisoned in relationships.

What We Need & What You Get

We need $7,000 to make this play a reality. All the money would go to pay for theater rental charges, director, actors, set designer, advertising, graphic design, sound design and lighting design fees, as well as royalties, costumes and props.
We tried to cut down costs as much as possible so everyone involved in this project is charging less than their normal fees, and the reason is because they love the project and want to support this cause.
What you get is good! As a thank you for your contribution, we would get you free tickets to come watch the play with a guest, you would be mentioned on our thank you notes of each program, and you'll get a signed copy of the play's poster by the actors, producer and director. 
If we don't reach our entire goal, we would still use whatever amount we get to make this play a reality. 


The Impact
This project is valuable to the world because as citizens we need to shed a light on the issues that matter to us. The world right now is paying close attention to women's issues so it's our turn to be heard to make a difference. Each one of us can do it from our own perspective, and my perspective is an artistic one so from the stage I'm taking a stand for this cause.
In 2014, thanks to all my friends and family who believe in me and my work, I was able to produce another play through this IndieGoGo platform called ""Aqui No Paga Nadie"" and as most of you know, it was a great success thanks to you and your collaboration! At that time, we were able to spread the message of hope and shed a light on injustice by a government that was and still is oppressing their people, and that message thankfully came across by being so well received by the audience in Venezuela.  
Now, I ask for your help again to allow us to cast light on this issue that has caused so many unnecessary deaths and pain within families. With your donation, this play can make someone who suffers from abuse to gain strength to fight for a better life.

Risks & Challenges
Making art is not an easy task because of the economy we live in, but when that's your calling in life you don't stop until you have given it your all in order to make dreams happen. 
Thankfully, we have a team that believes in the power of artistic expression, in this cause, in this story and on the impact we can create if we fight hard to make this a reality.

<h3>INTRODUCING... REIGNBOW!</h3>
<p>QWAM (Queens With A Mission) is so excited to premiere Reignbow! Aligned with our family's values, Reignbow will be an all encompassing premiere showcase of queer/ally talent in the Boston and East Coast Community! Reignbow will be a one of a kind experience; fitting no other previous show mold. The night will showcase talent in the following five categories: Drag Performance, Choreographers, Group Performance, Fashion, and Vocal Performance. Amidst and in-between all of the performances, attendees will be able to dance, party, and celebrate; breaking that fourth wall between audience and performers. Simply put, Reignbow allows ALL to express their royalty. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534172620/aedawqrr0tgnl1z7abpk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>JOIN OUR MISSION!</strong></h3>
<p>Reingbow is a royal undertaking! Amazing venue, apparel, quality sound and lighting, incredible DJ, videography, and performers for all over the East Coast; we are pulling out all the stops. In order for us to reach the high level production quality we hope to achieve, we need your help! As a newly founded dance family and a non profiting group, all expenses will be hitting our own personal wallets. No matter the size of the donation, we would appreciate all contributions in helping make Reignbow possible!</p>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>Reignbow will be an amazing celebratory night to remember! But the night goes beyond music and dancing. Reingbow will give a platform to diverse and unique LGBTQ/ally artists to showcase their passions and who they really are. More than just dancing, this showcase will express an amazing variety of talent. </p>
<p>Our hope is that Reignbow will not only help create and strengthen a community, but help build a more loving and accepting future. Reignbow's impact will hopefully continue each year as we aim to keep hosting and growing this event for years to come.</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We're Micah, Ali and Syd, three students putting up our senior project at Purchase College. We're collaborating with some of our creative colleagues to present Essence, a new play. </p>
<p>Micah Rabang is a senior Theatre and Performance major. He was born and raised in Oahu, Hawaii, and came to New York to pursue theatre. He is elated to be directing his own work.</p>
<p>Alison Eadie is a senior Theatre/ Performance and Arts Management double major. She will play the role of Mae in Essence, and also serve as a producer for the show, managing marketing and fundraising efforts. She is overjoyed to create something beautiful at Purchase before she graduates in December and heads off into the real world.</p>
<p>Syd Freiberger is a senior Theatre/ Performance and History double major. She will be serving as dramaturg for the production. She's excited to be working on such a meaningful project with such hardworking people.</p>

<h2>What is Essence?</h2>
<p>Essence is a new play written by Micah Rabang. </p>
<p>A young woman named Mae moves into a new home. She finds that this place is already occupied by a former resident; the spirit of another young woman. Her home rests upon the ashes of another. In the space between the living and the dead, they learn to understand each other through stories and movement. </p>
<h3>You're Invited!</h3>
<p>Essence will premiere at the Humanities Theater at Purchase College, October 19-21, 2017. Admission is FREE.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>As college students creating our capstone project, this effort is  entirely self funded. We need to raise $1,500 to bring Essence to life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Funds will go directly into the materials we need to build our show- sets, costumes, lights</li>
<li>Every dollar counts and we appreciate any donation- we will be able to put it to good use!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are ecstatic to present this project as a culmination of our time at Purchase.</p>
<p>Essence is a play about colonialism and the erasure of indigenous history and culture. We aim to give a voice to those who have been silenced in the past and the present and in doing so empower communities to tell their story.</p>

Maya Macdonald (Playwright): 

The dedication to LEAVE THE BALCONY OPEN reads:

 
 i thought this play was for the dead
it turns out, it is
for the living

 
This is quite literally where I began when I wrote this play. I had lost a great deal of people who were close to me, both emotionally, and in proximity. What became of this is a story of seven characters caught mid-sentence, caught between something that couldn't have possibly happened, and a need to express to someone that, yes, that thing actually did happen. I feel it speaks for this generation in a way stories to young people have not. It comes from the closest place I could find. Skin close. Ripped from the seams, even. It is my closeness to it that gave me the drive to keep pushing to tell the story. I wrote it to save my skin. I wrote it to keep living. I wrote it in case I had to leave it behind.

<h3>Landless Theatre is ALIIIIIVE!!!!</h3>
<p>In honor of our 10th anniversary, Landless Theatre Company is producing a World Premiere Prog-Metal Rock Opera: <strong>Richard Campbell's Frankenstein</strong>! The production will be produced in rep with our 3rd Annual Mashup Festival!</p>
<p>Landless has been pushing the envelope of FUN and OFF-BEAT theatre in Washington, DC since 2003. This face-melting new work we discovered by up-and-coming UK rock composer Richard Campbell is sure to rock your balls off as no theatre production ever before.</p>
<p>The production is directed and produced by <strong>Melissa Baughman</strong> and the team who brought you<strong> DIAMOND DEAD (2008 Best Musical Pick of the Capital Fringe)</strong>, with music direction by <strong>Jack Sossman (Baltimore Rock Opera Society)</strong>. It features a cast of dynamic local rock vocalists and actors, including:</p>
<p><strong>IRENE JERICHO (Cassandra Syndrome) as Elizabeth</strong></p>
<p><strong>ROBERT BRADLEY (Aries and BROS' Valhella) as Walton</strong></p>
<p><strong>GREG BOWEN (BROS' Valhella) as The Creature</strong></p>
<p><strong>ANDREW BAUGHMAN (Diamond Dead) as Victor Frankenstein</strong></p>
<p>Production Designers included <strong>JARED DAVIS </strong>(artbyjared.com), <strong>CHRIS HOLLAND </strong>and <strong>ELIZABETH REEVES</strong> (The Broken Continent).<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Our <strong>3rd Annual Mash-up Festival</strong> will include four new mash-up parody plays by local playwrights:</p>
<p><strong><em>The Walking Fred</em></strong> by <strong>MAURICE MARTIN</strong> (R.U.X.), Directed by <strong>ERIK MORRISON</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>True Blood Spatter</em></strong> by <strong>KERRI SHEEHAN</strong>, Directed by <strong>CHRIS GRIFFIN </strong><em>(Tarxxxanadu)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Saving Private Poo</em></strong> by <strong>STEVE CUSTER</strong> and <strong>IAN HOCH</strong>, Directed by <strong>STEVE CUSTER</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Trapped in the Convent</em></strong> by <strong>ANDREW LLOYD BAUGHMAN</strong>, Directed by <strong>KARISSA SWANIGAN-UPCHURCH </strong>(<em>Perez Hilton Saves The Universe)</em></p>
<p>In our first ten years, Landless Theatre company brought you DC premieres of <strong>EVIL DEAD THE MUSICAL, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG, HIGH FIDELITY A MUSICAL</strong> and many others. We need your help to kick off the next decade with work that is MORE challenging, MORE awesome, MORE Landless-y than ever, and to help propel us into a PERMANENT VENUE!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Keeping DC theatre zesty and irresistible (not to mention affordable) isn't easy, and producing a show at the historic and beautiful GALA Hispanic Theatre at Tivoli isn't cheap. Here is what your contribution helps to fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5500 - Overhead Expenses (Theatre Rental, Insurance)</li>
<li>$2000 - Lighting and Sound (Equipment and Labor)</li>
<li>$2000 - Set Construction (Materials)</li>
<li>$1000 - Costume Materials</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, your math is correct, the funding we are hoping to generate only partially offsets our expenses... and we don't even begin to pay the actors, directors and designers who dedicate their blood, sweat and tears to bring the show to LIFE.</p>
<p>That's why we need your help!</p>
<p>And here are a few of the perks we offer in return:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listing as a sponsor in the program</li>
<li>An invitation to visit a rehearsal and experience the creative process</li>
<li>Backstage tours of the production</li>
<li>Be our Guest of Honor at the Frankenstein GALA Reception</li>
<li>Signed concept albums</li>
<li>An opportunity to BUY OUT THE THEATRE!</li>
</ul>
<p>Landless Theatre Company is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated<strong> to cultivating new and diverse audiences for live theatre by producing exciting and accessible alternative theatre. </strong>All donations are tax-deductable to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
<p>The show must go on whether we reach our goal or not! So please lend support in any way you can!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support will help Landless Theatre Company BRIDGE THE GAP between mainstream audiences and live theatre, an art form of ever-decreasing significance with a work that BRIDGES THE GAP between the prog-metal music scene and musical theatre. You will also help develop the work of Richard Campbell, a young UK composer who who is destined to be a force in the prog-rock scene (his work is already featured on Rock Band, for crying out loud).</p>
<p>Your support of the 3rd Annual Mashup Festival will also help support the work of 5 local playwrights, 4 directors and a slew of DC's actors! The 1st Annual Mashup Festival spawned the NY Fringe Festival hit <em><strong>GLEEAM...</strong></em><strong> </strong>who knows what will come from this year's Fest?!</p>

The production is directed and produced by Melissa Baughman and the team who brought you DIAMOND DEAD (2008 Best Musical Pick of the Capital Fringe), with music direction by Jack Sossman (Baltimore Rock Opera Society). It features a cast of dynamic local rock vocalists and actors, including:
IRENE JERICHO (Cassandra Syndrome) as Elizabeth
ROBERT BRADLEY (Aries and BROS' Valhella) as Walton
GREG BOWEN (BROS' Valhella) as The Creature
ANDREW BAUGHMAN (Diamond Dead) as Victor Frankenstein
Production Designers included JARED DAVIS (artbyjared.com), CHRIS HOLLAND and ELIZABETH REEVES (The Broken Continent). 
Our 3rd Annual Mash-up Festival will include four new mash-up parody plays by local playwrights:
The Walking Fred by MAURICE MARTIN (R.U.X.), Directed by ERIK MORRISON
True Blood Spatter by KERRI SHEEHAN, Directed by CHRIS GRIFFIN (Tarxxxanadu)
Saving Private Poo by STEVE CUSTER and IAN HOCH, Directed by STEVE CUSTER
Trapped in the Convent by ANDREW LLOYD BAUGHMAN, Directed by KARISSA SWANIGAN-UPCHURCH (Perez Hilton Saves The Universe)
In our first ten years, Landless Theatre company brought you DC premieres of EVIL DEAD THE MUSICAL, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG, HIGH FIDELITY A MUSICAL and many others. We need your help to kick off the next decade with work that is MORE challenging, MORE awesome, MORE Landless-y than ever, and to help propel us into a PERMANENT VENUE!


What We Need & What You Get
Keeping DC theatre zesty and irresistible (not to mention affordable) isn't easy, and producing a show at the historic and beautiful GALA Hispanic Theatre at Tivoli isn't cheap. Here is what your contribution helps to fund:

$5500 - Overhead Expenses (Theatre Rental, Insurance)
$2000 - Lighting and Sound (Equipment and Labor)
$2000 - Set Construction (Materials)
$1000 - Costume Materials

Yes, your math is correct, the funding we are hoping to generate only partially offsets our expenses... and we don't even begin to pay the actors, directors and designers who dedicate their blood, sweat and tears to bring the show to LIFE.
That's why we need your help!
And here are a few of the perks we offer in return:

Listing as a sponsor in the program
An invitation to visit a rehearsal and experience the creative process
Backstage tours of the production
Be our Guest of Honor at the Frankenstein GALA Reception
Signed concept albums
An opportunity to BUY OUT THE THEATRE!

Landless Theatre Company is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to cultivating new and diverse audiences for live theatre by producing exciting and accessible alternative theatre. All donations are tax-deductable to the fullest extent of the law.
The show must go on whether we reach our goal or not! So please lend support in any way you can!


The Impact
Your support will help Landless Theatre Company BRIDGE THE GAP between mainstream audiences and live theatre, an art form of ever-decreasing significance with a work that BRIDGES THE GAP between the prog-metal music scene and musical theatre. You will also help develop the work of Richard Campbell, a young UK composer who who is destined to be a force in the prog-rock scene (his work is already featured on Rock Band, for crying out loud).
Your support of the 3rd Annual Mashup Festival will also help support the work of 5 local playwrights, 4 directors and a slew of DC's actors! The 1st Annual Mashup Festival spawned the NY Fringe Festival hit GLEEAM... who knows what will come from this year's Fest?!

<p><em><strong>Thanks to you </strong></em>we raised the $20,000 we needed to match the NEA funds for Rocks Karma Arrows!!! And 4-days a head of time!! Thank you so much for caring about community conversation on race and class in Boulder.</p>
<p>The campaign officially ends on June 19th -- the day in 1861 when Chief Niwot went to the Rocky Mountain News office to protest how the Arapaho were depicted in its newspaper pages. We align ourselves with Chief Niwot's many strategies for pursing justice. It is also Juneteenth, the oldest known celebration commemorating the end of slavery in the United States.</p>
<p>Additional funds that come in the last days of the campaign will help cover post-production costs on the film on Rocks Karma Arrows (and that will be a relief!) so let’s keep growing that final fundraising number!</p>

<p><br/>Three years ago, a small audience of people in Boulder, Colorado witnessed a transformative theater piece called “Rocks Karma Arrows”, which explores the history of Boulder through the lens of race and class. <br/><br/>The story begins with the tragic relationship between Chief Niwot of the Arapahoe Indians, who worked tirelessly to maintain peace, and the settlers who flocked to this territory when gold was discovered. It reveals a series of decisions and actions over the next 100 years that have cast their shadow over continuing efforts to wrestle with inequality today.<br/><br/>The play struck a nerve. Those whose experiences here have included struggle and discrimination felt validated. Those whose comfortable lives have shielded them from seeing this side of their community felt shocked into awareness. Everyone wanted to continue the conversation.<br/><br/>And thus One Action-One Boulder was conceived, an arts-based community-wide initiative designed to encourage the Boulder community to explore its past and present in order to inspire reflection and action towards a more inclusive and equitable future. <br/><br/><strong><em>We believe that engaging our community in an honest and open conversation about our local history – both the good parts and the uncomfortable parts – is an important first step to building a stronger and more equitable Boulder</em>.</strong> <br/><br/>To learn more about the organizations and activities that are part of One Action-One Boulder, visit the project website: <a href=""http://www.one-action.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.one-action.org/</a><br/><br/>As the inspiration and centerpiece for One Action-One Boulder, <strong>Kirsten Wilson’s acclaimed multi-media theater work “Rocks Karma Arrows” will return to the stage at the University of Colorado’s ATLAS Center July 12th-29th, 2012.</strong> But we need your support to mount this production, so that as many people as possible can see this inspiring, moving and ground-breaking work.<br/><br/><br/><strong>We Need YOU to Help Meet the Match!</strong><br/><br/>Putting on a multi-media production with a 12-person cast, and then capturing it on video to create an educational curriculum package, is a huge financial challenge. “Rocks Karma Arrows” was recently honored to be awarded a $40,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. In order to mount the production and receive the NEA grant, we need to match those federal funds dollar for dollar.

It will help us pay translators and interpreters who will make it possible to present “Rocks Karma Arrows” in Spanish for the large Spanish speaking community in Boulder County.
