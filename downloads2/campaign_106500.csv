<h3>The Project (Pitch/Plea):</h3>
<p>Help us make our first YouTube live-action series! (If you don't, who will?)</p>
<p><i><strong>THE VOID: REBOOTED</strong></i></p>
<p>6 half hour-ish episodes which re-boot (up the backside) a series we made for community television in 2012, when times were simpler. The show is a narrative ""skit-com"" style, filled to the Pacific Rim with geek-culture references (see? We even superfluously crammed one into that sentence!)</p>
<p><i><strong>SERIES SYNOPSIS:</strong></i></p>
<p>The Void is a “skit-com” about a small group of independent Australian filmmakers who, for the past 18 years, have been trapped by contract on a never-ending feature film production appropriately titled “The Void”. The reason the production never ends (and why they’ve so far only completed shooting 4% of it) is because their fascist, egomaniacal director, Gustaf, is constantly changing his concept for the film. The story and sometimes even the genre of each episode is determined by whatever new and insane idea has caught Gustaf’s fancy.</p>
<p>The world of The Void is also a flexible reality. Each episode contains tangential, self-contained skits that branch off from the main action, often incited by a line of dialogue or reference to whatever film or text is about to be parodied. </p>
<p><strong><i>Did we mention shooting starts in April?</i></strong></p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need an absolute minimum of $8000 to cover the costs of the shoot (only $40 a minute - WHAT!?). Anything we raise in addition to this will go towards paying our hard working, incredibly talented (and evidently brainwashed) cast and crew.  Funds raised will go towards:</p>

<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>The Shallow Valley TV Telethon is a short form comedic web series conceived by Owen Weir and Erica Giunta. The series follows a television station in the small, fictional town of Shallow Valley as they raise money to save their dying public television station. Shallow Valley is an “eclectic” town filled with weird and over the top characters who visit the station to provide demonstrations and participate in interviews. The SVTV Telethon 2017 is meant to be a hilarious satirical look into small town, local television news. We want to create an immersive and hysterical show that will make you laugh and smile!</p>

<p>This is where you come in!</p>
<p>We need your help getting the SVTV Telethon off the ground! With your help we can create this high concept show the way it is meant to be seen. If you donate, you will also be a part of the show!

<h2>Bound: The Series</h2>
<p>Co-Written by Alex Hughes and Colin J Murphy</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Featuring:</h3>
<p>Jack Ball, Goldie Flavelle, Alex Hughes, Julia Schlaepfer, Rob Morean, Heather Oakley, Adam Rodriguez , Kari Seward, Jen Parkhill, Ben Rosenthal, Joe Murphy, Toni Marie Gallardo, Spencer Wawak, Olivia Blue, Andrea Abello, Cassidy Edwards, Sydni Beaudoin, Brian Swinney and Cynthia Silver </p>

<h2>Premise:</h2>
<p>Focusing on a Narcotics Enforcement Agency that works to target specific drug dealers and manufacturers, with the intent of reducing street level drug activity, the series follows Jacob Hart, an out gay agent. Dealing with the notion of what it means to take care of someone else, Jacob tries to find a balance in his feelings between allegiance to his job, a codependent friendship and a new man in his life. In a place where the ""good guys"" get to identify how someone defines themselves, Jacob tries to find out if it is even possible to be a hero.</p>

<h2>A Letter from the Director</h2>
<p>Bound came into being as a sort of accident. Over a year ago, a joke between friends became the kernel that began this entire project. A conversation about the lack of representation and variation in the action genre began the process of looking at what became available when something that seems so extreme was to be humanized. My father is a cop who has frequently had his life put at risk based on jobs he was working. We wanted to set out to tell the story about the complexities of life that often are negated in the pressure cooker that is an action movie. I wanted to tell the story of what it means to love someone who you may fear won't return from work every day. This began the exploration of how to create fully realized human beings in a heightened world of drug culture, physical danger and psychosis. </p>
<p>The characters in Bound are messy and often unapologetically so. Alex and I have had many conversations about if any of them are ""bad guys"" and we continuously reach the same conclusion. Life is not as simple as an action movie. Everyone has their demons and everyone makes choices that may hurt those around them but they must validate these choices for themselves. We think to simply define anyone as just good or bad, you're ignoring the spectrum of human experience that is entirely in the gray area of behavior.</p>
<p>This has become such an important project for me and those involved because it is a story that asks how far love can be pushed before it fails, can someone cause so much destruction and still be a good person, and what does it mean to be a hero? We would love the opportunity to share this very personal and special series with you all and let you fall in love and out of love with these people just as we have!</p>

<h3><u>What are we doing?</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>The idea for ""Hustle Street"", the musical web series, was originally developed by Chrissy Mae Valentine and Rhyss Lee. Chrissy then took to the idea to personal friend and now, co-writer, Ian Escandor and the script developed beyond their original dreams, of just an idea, but to a short web series, with the intention to pitch the idea to several film production companies.</li>
<li>Chrissy Mae Valentine, Rhyss Lee and Ian Escandor, all of Filipino backgrounds, having grown up in Sydney's western suburbs, have a goal to challenge stereotypes surrounding the area and create a web series to promote the talent secretly hidden in Sydney's western suburb of Mount Druitt. </li>
<li>It has always been one of Chrissy Mae’s aspirations to create a body of work that reflected her life growing up in Mount Druitt. With her extensive experience on the screen and on stage, it seemed evident that taking the approach of a musical would be the most viable way of  expression. Ian is also personally invested in the project. As a resident and youth worker of the area, Ian believes that a project like this has the opportunity to excite and engage other local Blacktown artists, tell a unique story in an original way, and challenge the artists involved to be experimental all whilst developing their screenwriting, song writing, production skills - thus boosting the cultural value of Blacktown.<ul><li><strong>The idea has been in the works since November 2016 and has expanded greatly. Hustle Street currently has a crew of over 17 and a cast greater than 30 people (including professional dancers and actors), all of which are unpaid. Hustle Street has the potential to become something bigger than a web series - a break away from the stigma of an area handed a bad name.</strong></li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3><u>What we need from our donators and what we're giving back!</u></h3>
<ul><li>Because our team consists of young local artists and students, a lot of the current funds that have been getting us by have been as an input out of cast and crew's pockets <strong>($2,400 generously input by some crew members)</strong>. We are passionate about this project and see it, not as a way to make money, but as a means to create a positive vibe around Sydney's western suburbs and showcase the talent that can sometimes get overlooked in this area - therefore, the money, isn't what is important, although unfortunately, it is essential for us to continue to be able to go ahead and make this a bigger project with a greater production value behind it. <i>We believe in this project, which is why we've tried to input as much of our money as possible, but we need help!</i>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The most costly ""items"" have been obtaining filming licenses for public areas: <ul><li>Applying for permission is the easy part, but as each location has a fee, sometimes of <strong>$200-$300,</strong> and currently there are <strong>10 areas (approximately $2,000 needed just for locations alone),</strong> where our team is looking to film, that requires this fee paid up front, this can prove challenging for a group of young people trying to make something that appears, on screen, to it's highest potential.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>We have some actors (currently 2 in Melbourne and one in the United Kingdom), that are playing some lead roles in this web series. This proves difficult in terms of, not only writing together and rehearsing, but more so in obtaining assistance for payment of flights. Our pre-production team is trying to cover as much costs for our actors as possible, but your donations will help to not only assist us in paying our actors, even something small, but potentially housing them and help us to get them here, ahead of time and ready for filming!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Let's talk about equipment hire! Right now, we have been working with the equipment we have (mainly just cameras borrowed from friends and family), but for the most part, we need to consider hiring out equipment, which means, equipment fees:<ul>

<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>Why does this matter to us? Why should it matter to you?</p>
<p>To put this bluntly,<u><strong> we really give a damn about this project</strong></u>. Not just because we've been working on it for so long, not just because we have a team of over 8 writers currently working on ways to make the script better, not just because we like to sing and dance, but because Sydney's western suburbs have always been hit hard with hurtful, and most of the time, untrue and unfair labels. We're not going to name names, but films and documentaries made about this area have often depicted us all in a bad light and the fact of the matter is, a lot of it was created on stereotypes, because unfortunately, stereotypes sell. <strong>We're here to change stereotypes</strong>. More than half of our cast and crew grew up in Mount Druitt and we don't feel that it has hindered us in any way and we don't think it makes us less important than the next suburb.</p>

<h3>Our personal challenges</h3>
<p>This industry is not only difficult to make a dent in, but it is fickle. The hardest part for us has been finding people as committed to us because the fact of the matter is, we don't have the funds to really pay people so a lot of the work has come from a genuine desire to make something great. So our biggest challenge has been solidifying a team and trying to wrangle budgets for locations, equipment hire, costume, set design and air fares. We've been combating this by investing out of our own pockets, which has been working well, but as our project expands, this means we can't do it alone anymore.</p>
<p>This means we need your help. Hustle Street is currently in the works to creating a promo video for our audiences. We've managed to get all this way through team work, some serious commitment and lots of man-hours.

The idea for ""Hustle Street"", the musical web series, was originally developed by Chrissy Mae Valentine and Rhyss Lee. Chrissy then took to the idea to personal friend and now, co-writer, Ian Escandor and the script developed beyond their original dreams, of just an idea, but to a short web series, with the intention to pitch the idea to several film production companies.
Chrissy Mae Valentine, Rhyss Lee and Ian Escandor, all of Filipino backgrounds, having grown up in Sydney's western suburbs, have a goal to challenge stereotypes surrounding the area and create a web series to promote the talent secretly hidden in Sydney's western suburb of Mount Druitt. 
It has always been one of Chrissy Mae’s aspirations to create a body of work that reflected her life growing up in Mount Druitt. With her extensive experience on the screen and on stage, it seemed evident that taking the approach of a musical would be the most viable way of  expression. Ian is also personally invested in the project. As a resident and youth worker of the area, Ian believes that a project like this has the opportunity to excite and engage other local Blacktown artists, tell a unique story in an original way, and challenge the artists involved to be experimental all whilst developing their screenwriting, song writing, production skills - thus boosting the cultural value of Blacktown.The idea has been in the works since November 2016 and has expanded greatly. Hustle Street currently has a crew of over 17 and a cast greater than 30 people (including professional dancers and actors), all of which are unpaid. Hustle Street has the potential to become something bigger than a web series - a break away from the stigma of an area handed a bad name.



What we need from our donators and what we're giving back!
Because our team consists of young local artists and students, a lot of the current funds that have been getting us by have been as an input out of cast and crew's pockets ($2,400 generously input by some crew members). We are passionate about this project and see it, not as a way to make money, but as a means to create a positive vibe around Sydney's western suburbs and showcase the talent that can sometimes get overlooked in this area - therefore, the money, isn't what is important, although unfortunately, it is essential for us to continue to be able to go ahead and make this a bigger project with a greater production value behind it. We believe in this project, which is why we've tried to input as much of our money as possible, but we need help!

 

The most costly ""items"" have been obtaining filming licenses for public areas: Applying for permission is the easy part, but as each location has a fee, sometimes of $200-$300, and currently there are 10 areas (approximately $2,000 needed just for locations alone), where our team is looking to film, that requires this fee paid up front, this can prove challenging for a group of young people trying to make something that appears, on screen, to it's highest potential.

We have some actors (currently 2 in Melbourne and one in the United Kingdom), that are playing some lead roles in this web series. This proves difficult in terms of, not only writing together and rehearsing, but more so in obtaining assistance for payment of flights. Our pre-production team is trying to cover as much costs for our actors as possible, but your donations will help to not only assist us in paying our actors, even something small, but potentially housing them and help us to get them here, ahead of time and ready for filming!

 
Let's talk about equipment hire! Right now, we have been working with the equipment we have (mainly just cameras borrowed from friends and family), but for the most part, we need to consider hiring out equipment, which means, equipment fees:

Jib: $70 p/day

Cineslider motor kit: $100 p/day

Audio equipment (lapels, recorders, zooms, boom mics, XLR cables, Wind shield): All of these total to $160 p/day, and that's just one of each item. Realistically, we would need 2-3 each, bringing the total needed to at least $480 and that's just for one day of filming.


 
In terms of set design and costume, this is another area where your funds will help greatly! For a great production, we need better looking costume and set design than we currently have. Realistically, a goal of $1,000 just for set design and costume is our current goal as we will try to source as much as we can from our own homes/borrow from friends and family so that with the excess of what we save, we can input this into things like equipment hire and potential wages for talent. We are young students, so we're thrifty and we try to be as cost effective as possible,  which is great, but with any great production, the more funds we have to pay for better costume, makeup/hair artists, then the better a chance we have of making something that is a cut above the rest!
All donations will be used wisely. The most important areas for funds to go into will be everything mentioned above (mainly location fees first as these need to be up front before we can film). 
Because we believe that a team needs a uniform, we have created shirts for our cast and crew to wear on our filming days! Which brings us to our next point:

PERKS! We have been fortunate enough to work with a Graphic Designer who has developed a unique logo for us! Our designer has done a fantastic job at giving us our own individual look, which means:
When you donate $1000.00 or more, you will receive a customised Hustle Street t-shirt as a thank you! You will also receive an Executive producer mention in our credits, a live streaming of rehearsals, a Hustle street lanyard AND footage of our promo video we'll be filming on the 21st of July 2017, that nobody else will get to see until it's actual release date! 
When you donate $100 or more, you will receive a Hustle Street t-shirt and lanyard!
When you donate $50 or more, you will receive a Hustle Street lanyard and  personal thank you from our cast and crew

<p>Alleyways have always seemed to us enigmatic, to say the least.<br/><br/>They are like the city’s supporting actors, where highways and big boulevards take the front role, and where driving seems more appreciated than walking. We, nonetheless, like to go slow. Taking it step by step, observing and listening to the unexpected.<br/><br/>There’s so much to be told about these often dark, hidden places. Alleys are like the unofficial story, the footnotes of the city’s daily life, and there is a lack of stories being told about them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506994810/kenmwmxdxsj2tafhvyoa.png"" src=""""/></p> <p><strong>Have you ever wonder how many stories are written and painted in these narrow passages?</strong></p>
<p>A couple of years ago, we decided to take a closer look inside alleyways. We began the production of our first season in the San Francisco Bay Area, the place some of us call home. Right in front of us there was so much to show and so much to tell. They were not only stories that took place in San Francisco, Oakland, or Richmond, but a rich convergence of art, music and struggles from around the globe that captivated us even more.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever wonder how an Alley really Sounds?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a door closing from afar. Squeaking sounds of sewers and pipes beating against each other and amplifying like hands drumming. Imagine walking through an alleyway in any city around the world. Engines, sirens, barking, and honking populate the background while you walk, but you can still hear your footsteps echoing back to you. The confined shape of alleyways makes them ideal for listening. That’s why we think the sound of music here makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>Music in alleyways has an extra layer of amplification and sound quality which intensifies the experience for both the audience and the musicians. We want to turn this often ignored space into a global stage for local emerging bands to share their work and to help amplify stories being told in and about public space.</p>

Alleyways have always seemed to us enigmatic, to say the least.They are like the city’s supporting actors, where highways and big boulevards take the front role, and where driving seems more appreciated than walking. We, nonetheless, like to go slow. Taking it step by step, observing and listening to the unexpected.There’s so much to be told about these often dark, hidden places. Alleys are like the unofficial story, the footnotes of the city’s daily life, and there is a lack of stories being told about them.
 Have you ever wonder how many stories are written and painted in these narrow passages?
A couple of years ago, we decided to take a closer look inside alleyways. We began the production of our first season in the San Francisco Bay Area, the place some of us call home. Right in front of us there was so much to show and so much to tell. They were not only stories that took place in San Francisco, Oakland, or Richmond, but a rich convergence of art, music and struggles from around the globe that captivated us even more.
Have you ever wonder how an Alley really Sounds?
Imagine a door closing from afar. Squeaking sounds of sewers and pipes beating against each other and amplifying like hands drumming. Imagine walking through an alleyway in any city around the world. Engines, sirens, barking, and honking populate the background while you walk, but you can still hear your footsteps echoing back to you. The confined shape of alleyways makes them ideal for listening. That’s why we think the sound of music here makes a lot of sense.Music in alleyways has an extra layer of amplification and sound quality which intensifies the experience for both the audience and the musicians. We want to turn this often ignored space into a global stage for local emerging bands to share their work and to help amplify stories being told in and about public space.
 


Alley Sounds needs your help to make these season come to life. We have shot the majority of the first 6-episode season, but we still need to cover the final production, post production, and promotion costs, which are essential parts of a project of this kind.Here’s exactly what this Kickstarter campaign will go to support…

CRAVE  shows that trekking through the struggle of working for oneself, with dedication, will ultimately prove to be successful.A millennial perspective is the experience of living with new technology and methods of communication, and the behavior that stems from this experience -- online dating culture and lack in interpersonal skills, social media, freedom of the everyday work schedule, the façade of success through brand exposure, 'couch surfing', and more!Why Should I Contribute?This project would not be a reality without your generous support! CRAVE is an independent web series with a limited budget, and your donations will directly cover costs to film the pilot episode, including renting locations, paying cast and crew for their time, supplies, meals on set, and much more. As dedicated filmmakers, we are committed to making your contributions meaningful throughout the progression of this web series.With your help, we will be able to reach a large audience and hopefully distribute our story to a major digital platform, such as Netflix, HULU, Amazon, etc., where you can access content from the comfort of your own home.How Can I Donate?Here on Indiegogo!Nirine S.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;color: #3753B0;""><strong>We are ready to make this show.<br/>Now we just need your help.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>We are a group of creators that care so passionately about sharing our art that we banded together to create a new comedic series.  Unfortunately, we are young emerging artists who work multiple jobs and we simply cannot fund the entire thing ourselves so we need your support. We are friendly strangers just hustling to make our dreams a reality. It would mean the world to us if you would join us!</p>
<h3><strong>How did this Project Start?</strong></h3>
<p>The core of our team all met in college where we studied acting for film, television and voice over at Seneca College. After graduation we all went off on our own and hustled trying to get our acting careers started. A couple years go by and just like that, we found ourselves back in each others lives and wanting to collaborate - all with an eagerness to create our own work, tell our own stories, and further our careers. Having spent those couple years being on our own in the industry we all realized something very important - you need family. Seneca is a family. We spent endless hours in class together. We've seen each others most vulnerable moments and each others triumphs. It is extremely hard to go through this industry alone and deal with constant rejection. We were all tired of being told no, so instead we gave ourselves a yes and created our own work. We want to show you what we can do! </p>
<p>With your help and generosity you will be giving us the tools to shoot a web series that means something. This project is very important for everyone to watch and enjoy! Our show includes a family consisting of a multitude of sexualities and ethnicities. Our focus isn't on that however our focus is to bring awareness to the fact that these are normal circumstances in today's world. We don't put the spotlight on the ""different characters"", instead, we shine a light on a family with quirks just like any other while still talking about issues that matter to the LGBTQ community.</p>
<h3><strong>Where the Money Will Go</strong></h3>
<p>We <u>need a minimum of $6000</u> to film 'So That Happened', That's A LOT of loonies! If we go over our goal, not only will we be ecstatic but it of course means we can afford to do more exciting things with the show! We have budgeted everything from craft services to equipment and location rentals. We've cut costs in every way we could think of and it came down to five grand for a 13-day shoot.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of how the money is going to be budgeted - in no particular order: </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>1 - A STRONG CREW<i> - minimum of $4000</i></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Director of Photography (the person responsible for what the movie LOOKS like)</li>
<li>Sound Mixer (the person responsible for what the show SOUNDS like)</li>
<li>Production Manager &amp; Production Assistants</li>
<li>Assistant Director, 2nd Camera</li>
<li>Makeup, Hair, Props, Set Decoration &amp; Location Necessities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2 - EQUIPMENT, PROPS, SET DEC<i> - minimum of $2000</i></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cameras, Lenses &amp; Sound Recording Equipment</li>
<li>Lighting Equipment &amp; Special Effects</li>
<li>Props &amp; Items to Decorate our Location</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3 - CRAFT SERVICES - <i>minimum of $1500</i></strong></p>
<p>Although we have all of our wonderful parents &amp; friends donating a dinner or two, we still have many mouths to feed especially since we will be working ten days straight, at least 12 hours a day, with 2 extra days on the side. My offer of Mr.Noodles for ten days was quickly shot down.</p>
<p><strong>4 - LOTS OF OTHER STUFF</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance, Payment Processing &amp; Other Administrative Fees.</li>
<li>Distribution and Marketing</li>
<li>Post-Production, i.e editing all of the footage, colour correction, sound and much more!</li>
<li>These small but extremely important things really add up when it comes to money!</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see these 4 priorities already put us needing more than our goal but we are all contributing as much of our own money that we can afford and this will hopefully counteract the deficit. If we do not meet our goal, the series might not be able to be produced and we would have no series to shoot.  This is why we really need your support!</p>
<h3><strong>What Happens if we Raise More than our $6k Goal?</strong></h3>
<p>Truthfully, that would be ideal.  This series is going to cost considerably more than our goal amount as we plan to source additional funds from our own pockets as well as by getting some business sponsors on board to partner with us.  If we raise more than our goal, we can have the flexibility to use better equipment, have additional on-set support, and to pay our actors a modest fee - all of whom are working on this project pro-bono.  Furthermore, it would allow us to ramp-up our marketing efforts to ensure that even more people see this series.</p>
<h3><strong>What About the Perks?</strong></h3>
<p>We want you all to be involved in some way with the show which is why we created perks that are interactive and allow you to take part in the development of the series. </p>
<p>Some perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name in the credits (available for any donation)</li>
<li>Making choices about how the Secret Episode plays out and then getting to watch it too!</li>
<li>Choosing a costume that a character will wear in an episode or being the voice of the So That Happened outro.</li>
<li>Getting a bunch of swag with The Ultimate Fan Club perk.</li>
<li>Co-hosting an episode of the Behind the Scenes show with Tyler James.</li>
<li>and lost more...check out the sidebar to see them all.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Even though this series is a comedy, it is still dealing with subject matter that can impact many.  The series creator, Matkai Burmaster, is a member of the LGBTQ community himself and he has seen the impact that ignorance can have on LGBTQ people. Many don't understand, for example, the intricacies of what it means to be trans, and people aren't exposed to gay characters that don't fit into the standard stereotypes presented by the media today. Our series presents a trans character, a gay character, and a character that doesn't define her sexuality in ways where the characters lives are the focus.  We know that our series can be a beacon of hope for those who are LGBTQ and can provide some new education to those who may not yet understand the variety of people that exist within our community.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although we have already mitigated many of the risks, we want to be upfront and honest with our supporters about challenges that may potentially exist.  These include: accidents on set, crew or actors unable to continue with the project, and not reaching our campaign goal here on IndieGoGo.  However, we are fierce and tenacious and we know that we can solve any issue that comes our way.  This project is important to us and we will not give up without a fight.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Trust us, money is always tight with us so we understand if you can't contribute financially, but you can still be equally a part of the series helping in other ways like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign with your friends and family.</li>
<li>Follow the show on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @sothatseries</li>
<li>Introduce us to companies that may want to sponsor us with cash or in-kind services.</li>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about what we are doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, you have given us more than we can ask for by reading all of this info and we honestly, and truly appreciate your generosity. </p>
<p>Thank you,<br/>Ally, Deanna, Matkai, Remi, and Brian</p>

<p>ACTRA is the Association for Canadian Television and Radio Artists and is the organization that protects the rights and safety of professional actors.  All actors in this production are members of the association and are bound to work only on projects that follow the rules and guidelines set forth by ACTRA.  This is important because it means that actors can earn a fair wage for their work and can gain respect and dignity within the communities they serve.  When you watch a big name movie in the cinema, most or all of the actors you see are part of ACTRA, SAG-AFTRA (the US equivalent), or another similar organization.</p>

Although we have already mitigated many of the risks, we want to be upfront and honest with our supporters about challenges that may potentially exist.  These include: accidents on set, crew or actors unable to continue with the project, and not reaching our campaign goal here on IndieGoGo.  However, we are fierce and tenacious and we know that we can solve any issue that comes our way.  This project is important to us and we will not give up without a fight.

Other Ways You Can Help
Trust us, money is always tight with us so we understand if you can't contribute financially, but you can still be equally a part of the series helping in other ways like:

Share this campaign with your friends and family.
Follow the show on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @sothatseries
Introduce us to companies that may want to sponsor us with cash or in-kind services.
Get the word out and make some noise about what we are doing.

Either way, you have given us more than we can ask for by reading all of this info and we honestly, and truly appreciate your generosity. 
Thank you,Ally, Deanna, Matkai, Remi, and Brian
 
 
 

ACTRA is the Association for Canadian Television and Radio Artists and is the organization that protects the rights and safety of professional actors.  All actors in this production are members of the association and are bound to work only on projects that follow the rules and guidelines set forth by ACTRA.  This is important because it means that actors can earn a fair wage for their work and can gain respect and dignity within the communities they serve.  When you watch a big name movie in the cinema, most or all of the actors you see are part of ACTRA, SAG-AFTRA (the US equivalent), or another similar organization.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This project is run by myself (T.J. Grof), and my two Co-Writers, Samantha Sawicki, and Callie Gill. We are all students and alum of Studio School LA and this project is my thesis project; we want it to go much further than just a grade, we want it to be a potential series on a major network. We want to portray the journey and effort required to survive summer break. </p>
<p>Summer break is here! ...But god damn it summer break is here and kids live with you. What are you to do? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We all know they're not just handing out free llama rentals. That's where the money's going! Well, long term, that's where the future of the project is headed. Llama rental. It's a Fortnite thing. The kids love the Fortnite.</p>
<p>But first, we need to make the pilot and prove the concept is as damn-near-all-out hilarious as we think it is. </p>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>B-B-B-Break it down *record scratch*</li>
<li>$5200. That's what we need. Do you have an additional $5200? We do not. Do you have an additional $25? We already put all our money in. We're broke:-(</li>
<li>Perks? You betcha! We got shirts with a logo on 'em. You can have one if you donate. Then you can wear it. We might also have koozies to mail out with the shirts. Beer!</li>
<li>We're making Summer Broke whether we raise the full $5200 or not. If not we'll just shoot it in a sketchy back alley with child labor. It's an important story for us to tell and we will find a way to tell it. That said, if we raise <i>more</i> than our requested amount we might digitally add lasers! Lasers, son! How fun is that?!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Value to the world? Infinite. </li>
<li>This is the first time I've crowdfunded. You get to be my first. You always remember your first...5200.</li>
<li>Yay! You're doing it, you're doing it. You're donating money and getting chuckles and possibly a t-shirt in return! Great work!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Oh the risks! Oh the challenges! Let. Me. Tell. You! Not having $5200 is a BIG risk. Spooky. I would like to feed my crew without having to sell my wife's car. If I sell her car I will be left with only a TV pilot and my family will move to Boca Raton. Nobody wants that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we overcome these risks? *Alaskan accent* Oh you betcha! </li>
<li>We will overcome these harrowing risks through prayer and laughter. That's a lie. We will use all laughter. And possibly chuckles. Laughter cures all that ails. Also $5200 cures what ails this production.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>How can you help if funds are tight? You can share this campaign. And then tell your friends, family, co-workers, and pets to share it as well. The more pockets...errrrr... hearts and minds we reach the better chance we have of putting unnecessary lasers into the background... and foreground.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seriously, thank you for making it through this page and considering throwing $5 at our collective faces. If you can share that is just as helpful. </li>
<li>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools?....Use the share tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use them share buttons and also them donate buttons. Or mail me a check with the memo as LASERS. Thanks for looking at my campaign and have a very good day.</p>

<p>Perfectly Serious Productions is a fandom parody channel and has been creating content on YouTube for the past 3 years. Its library includes music video parodies, sketches, reaction videos, vlogs, &amp; challenges.  The channel is run by us 3 women. We've known each other since high school and we're thrilled to still be producing videos over 10 years later on a much bigger scale and with a newer platform! This will be our 8th project campaign and you guys have been the ones making it happen. We hope you can join us in the magic on this next one!</p>

<p>This campaign will launch a new chapter of content that is produced on Perfectly Serious Production's channel. We are excited for this new venture and can't wait to share what we have in store. This will be our first mini series and we hope you can help us make it happen!</p>
<p>6 mini episodes will be funded after raising this campaign's goal. This includes equipment, locations, wardrobe, makeup, hair/wigs, props, set dressing, meals for cast/crew, insurance, our intro for each episode, and composition for each episode in the series. </p>

<p>The Bachelor: Princess Edition is a parody of the show “The Bachelor” featuring twelve princesses as the contestants and a prince as the bachelor. The princesses will compete for Prince Charming’s heart through the course of six short episodes through one-on-one dates and other activities while staying all together in a mansion. The prince will give roses at the end of each episode to those he wants to stay, and those who do not receive a rose will be asked to leave until there is only one left. Who will he choose?</p>
<p>Written by our talented friend Alastair James Murden, this series will leave you rolling on the floor laughing and wondering why no one ever thought of this idea sooner.</p>

<p>This will be our first ever web series and we cannot express how excited we are to jump into this new arena! We have always wanted to create a series with new episodes that people can look forward to each week, since it creates a sense of suspense and excitement as the tension in the story builds. We want our viewers to come on a journey with us to make predictions about what might happen and communicate their thoughts and feelings about the project as it goes along. Your feedback is extremely important to us and helps us grow our channel more and more every year.</p>

<p>The location is the most important part of our budget. It is also the largest part, taking up 3/5th of our entire budget. By shooting at a giant mansion located in the hills of Calabasas, we will capture the essence of “The Bachelor” and the magic of fairy tales. Join us as we escape to a new reality where modern princesses compete for the heart of their one true love, Prince Charming.</p>

<p>Every single dollar we receive goes straight to making the production better looking, better sounding, and all around just more epic to watch. With your help we’re able to bring the worlds of The Bachelor and Disney Princesses to life in a 6 part mini series.</p>
<p>We'll be real - most of the money is going to the location. We're able to save a lot of money on costumes by casting cosplayers who already own them. We're able to shoot with a camera that a friend owns for an extremely discounted rate. We can produce high quality original music with real singers and a composer for 1/5 of the price it should cost. All of our cast and most of our crew are donating their time to work at no cost for us because they believe in the project. The location (even though deeply discounted) is our highest expense. Insurance and meals for the cast/crew are next and those are things we cannot avoid. Whatever we do not raise of our goal will come out of our pockets and production will be paused until we have what we need. </p>
<p>So every donation, no matter how big or small, really does help! It involves the backer in the project itself, separating you from being just another viewer. We appreciate you and can't express enough how much we need you for this project to succeed. Let's make the magic happen! </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Upon completion, this mini series will be released on YouTube and will be free to watch, like every single one of our productions. Men, women, girls, and boys will have access to 6 episodes of high quality, funny, and family friendly material. The essence of both The Bachelor and Disney Princesses will be portrayed and the potential audience will reach to all ages and places of the world. Did you know that our second highest watching country after the USA is India? That means that we're making someone smile across the world. And by providing free content, everyone has access to it. Our purpose with this mini series is to bring The Bachelor: Princess Edition to life to brighten the days of Disney Princess fans and Bachelor Nation lovers everywhere.</p>
<p>We've had thousands of comments on previous videos from people of all walks of life. Seeing their joy, even if it was just for the 5 minutes while watching a video, makes this all worth it. Spreading positivity and putting something driven by passion and not a paycheck into the world is the ultimate reward. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>After our project is funded, we'll still run into risks and challenges with the actual logistics of running a film shoot and seeing it through post production. Something can always go wrong - and it usually does! Sometimes permits take longer than expected, an actor can drop out last minute, weather can affect outdoor shooting days, and so much more can happen to anyone shooting any kind of project, no matter how big or small. On our last big production-- Westworld Parody-- we actually had to reschedule our shooting date at Paramount Ranch (that we had planned on for 3 months) just a few days before due to a huge rainstorm that came through southern California. It was very stressful having to figure out all over again the availability of about 50 people at the last minute, but we managed to find a new date that worked with the majority of our cast and crew as well as the location without costing us much more than some re-booking fees.</p>
<p>Since this is our fourth large-scale production with Perfectly Serious, we believe we are ready to tackle problems we have run into in the past as well as any new ones that may arise. We face snags together as a team when they come and we always manage to pull through, one task at a time.</p>

We've known each other since high school and we're thrilled to still be producing videos over 10 years later on a much bigger scale and with a newer platform! This will be our 8th project campaign and you guys have been the ones making it happen. We hope you can join us in the magic on this next one!

Caitlin Halliburton - Director

Katey Fittingoff - Producer

Julia Markas - Producer
This campaign will launch a new chapter of content that is produced on Perfectly Serious Production's channel. We are excited for this new venture and can't wait to share what we have in store. This will be our first mini series and we hope you can help us make it happen!
6 mini episodes will be funded after raising this campaign's goal. This includes equipment, locations, wardrobe, makeup, hair/wigs, props, set dressing, meals for cast/crew, insurance, our intro for each episode, and composition for each episode in the series. 

The Bachelor: Princess Edition is a parody of the show “The Bachelor” featuring twelve princesses as the contestants and a prince as the bachelor. The princesses will compete for Prince Charming’s heart through the course of six short episodes through one-on-one dates and other activities while staying all together in a mansion. The prince will give roses at the end of each episode to those he wants to stay, and those who do not receive a rose will be asked to leave until there is only one left. Who will he choose?
Written by our talented friend Alastair James Murden, this series will leave you rolling on the floor laughing and wondering why no one ever thought of this idea sooner.

We're very excited that our talented Director of Photography, Isaiah Shinn, will be joining us again for this project! He shot Westworld Parody and The Cloned Orphan for us and we could not have asked for better images!

We are also excited to announce another returning crew member to the team, please welcome back Joshua Hendricks, our composer! His original score for Westworld Parody captured the essence of Westworld's western vibe while staying true to Taylor Swift's style of 'Look What You Made Me Do'. He composed our Intro Theme Song and will be scoring each of the 6 episodes!

Joshua Hendricks - Composer

Still from our Westworld Parody
Enjoy this Sneak Peek of the lyrics for the intro title sequence of the show:

This will be our first ever web series and we cannot express how excited we are to jump into this new arena! We have always wanted to create a series with new episodes that people can look forward to each week, since it creates a sense of suspense and excitement as the tension in the story builds. We want our viewers to come on a journey with us to make predictions about what might happen and communicate their thoughts and feelings about the project as it goes along. Your feedback is extremely important to us and helps us grow our channel more and more every year.

The location is the most important part of our budget. It is also the largest part, taking up 3/5th of our entire budget. By shooting at a giant mansion located in the hills of Calabasas, we will capture the essence of “The Bachelor” and the magic of fairy tales. Join us as we escape to a new reality where modern princesses compete for the heart of their one true love, Prince Charming.



The home is 10,000 square feet and includes a boastful driveway where princesses will exit the carriage (limo) to meet the Prince Bachelor and be escorted through the enormous entryway. The house is staged perfectly with furniture, table settings, fireplaces, and a beautifully lush backyard that will create the ideal setting for this series.

Every single dollar we receive goes straight to making the production better looking, better sounding, and all around just more epic to watch. With your help we’re able to bring the worlds of The Bachelor and Disney Princesses to life in a 6 part mini series.

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>""The Change"" is a docu-reality series being produced by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7736203/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chris Circeo</a> and me, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7203905/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steven Crocker</a>. The show will be shot by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7367154/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr37"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Victor Collins</a>.  We are all recent graduates of <a href=""http://odu.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Old Dominion University</a>'s Film and Television program and have worked together on multiple projects.  We are very excited to work together on ""The Change!"" </p>
<p>The purpose of this docu-reality show is to enlighten viewers on volunteer opportunities in their area and inspire them to help.  We will do this by introducing viewers to volunteers with inspiring stories and deep roots in the organizations.  From these people, viewers will learn about both the organizations and the issues they are combatting. We have been blessed with the help of Susan Pleasants and <a href=""http://volunteerhr.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Volunteer Hampton Roads</a> to find non-profits to work with.</p>
<p>We will use a ""Dirty Jobs"" approach to volunteerism by putting a host in the field working with the aforementioned volunteers to act as the liaison between the audience and the organization. We want to have a call to action that permeates into our viewership and gets people interested in helping their community.</p>
<p>Every day we’re bombarded with the doom and gloom of the world around us, all the while ignoring the good that we, as a society, have to offer.  We would like to shine a light on the extraordinary things that people are doing to help their communities.  We believe there’s a story to tell and we believe this show will be a platform to tell it.   Everyone has a cause they believe in.  They just might not know it yet.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are seeking funding in the amount of $4,000 to cover the costs of shooting a series of pilot episodes of ""The Change.""  These pilot episodes will cover non-profits with areas of impact in homelessness, animal welfare, and health and wellness.  Chris and I are covering a lot of the pre-production costs out of our own pockets, however, we are not able to fund the entire production. The $4,000 DOES NOT include payment for us; we are so passionate about this that we are okay with volunteering our time to produce it. We are just going to be a skeleton crew to keep our costs as low as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Host - We want the best from our host, so in order to ensure they are in it to win it, we need to compensate for their time. If the host we cast is from out of town, we will also need to pay to put her in a hotel for the duration of shooting.</li>
<li>Music - Obtaining licensing rights for music can sometimes be costly.  While royalty-free music does exist, sometimes there is a subscription fee to a database or a one-time fee to download music.</li>
<li>Storage - We need to buy a hard drive dedicated to backing up footage for The Change to ensure we don't lose everything we have.</li>
<li>Catering - 10-12 hour shooting days mean that our crew will have to be fed. We want to be able to provide a bountiful meal that will keep the crew's morale up.</li>
<li>Contingency - The fundraising goal is extremely low compared to what a network would pay to have the same thing produced. We have included a 10% contingency to cover any costs that may arise that we are not already anticipating. Indiegogo also takes a small percentage of the funds raised, so we want to  be sure that after that is deducted, we still have enough to shoot.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of contributing to ""The Change"" is huge.  By helping fund this show, you are helping increase volunteerism in the Hampton Roads area in a unique way.  I was an intern on the Hampton Roads based reality show ""I Got This"" (2015) and I can say from experience, there is something special about seeing your community on television in a different light than strictly on the news.</p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>A challenge we face is that even $4,000 isn't a lot of money to produce a show on the level that we want to produce ""The Change,"" yet it is also a large amount of money to attempt to crowdfund. If we do not reach our goal, hopefully we will be significantly closer to it than we are now so that we can work to supplement ourselves. We will do the best with what we have.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>A final element that we would love to have in ""The Change"" are per-episode sponsorships.  If you or someone you know is a business owner and would like to make a tax-deductible donation to one of the non-profits we work with you can use this show as a medium to do so.  </p>
<p>It is understood that financial contributions cannot always be made.  We also value support given by spreading this campaign by sharing our <a href=""http://facebook.com/thechangeshow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://twitter.com/thechangeshow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a>, <a href=""http://instagram.com/bethechangeshow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>, and <a href=""https://pro-labs.imdb.com/title/tt6054366?s=6cab9511-ff50-8632-2d66-4b612f062374"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IMDB</a> pages.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and we hope you are able to be a part of ""The Change!""</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

Every day we’re bombarded with the doom and gloom of the world around us, all the while ignoring the good that we, as a society, have to offer.  We would like to shine a light on the extraordinary things that people are doing to help their communities.  We believe there’s a story to tell and we believe this show will be a platform to tell it.   Everyone has a cause they believe in.  They just might not know it yet.

What We Need
We are seeking funding in the amount of $4,000 to cover the costs of shooting a series of pilot episodes of ""The Change.""  These pilot episodes will cover non-profits with areas of impact in homelessness, animal welfare, and health and wellness.  Chris and I are covering a lot of the pre-production costs out of our own pockets, however, we are not able to fund the entire production. The $4,000 DOES NOT include payment for us; we are so passionate about this that we are okay with volunteering our time to produce it. We are just going to be a skeleton crew to keep our costs as low as possible.

Host - We want the best from our host, so in order to ensure they are in it to win it, we need to compensate for their time. If the host we cast is from out of town, we will also need to pay to put her in a hotel for the duration of shooting.
Music - Obtaining licensing rights for music can sometimes be costly.  While royalty-free music does exist, sometimes there is a subscription fee to a database or a one-time fee to download music.
Storage - We need to buy a hard drive dedicated to backing up footage for The Change to ensure we don't lose everything we have.
Catering - 10-12 hour shooting days mean that our crew will have to be fed. We want to be able to provide a bountiful meal that will keep the crew's morale up.
Contingency - The fundraising goal is extremely low compared to what a network would pay to have the same thing produced. We have included a 10% contingency to cover any costs that may arise that we are not already anticipating. Indiegogo also takes a small percentage of the funds raised, so we want to  be sure that after that is deducted, we still have enough to shoot.


The Impact
The impact of contributing to ""The Change"" is huge.  By helping fund this show, you are helping increase volunteerism in the Hampton Roads area in a unique way.  I was an intern on the Hampton Roads based reality show ""I Got This"" (2015) and I can say from experience, there is something special about seeing your community on television in a different light than strictly on the news.
Risks and Challenges
A challenge we face is that even $4,000 isn't a lot of money to produce a show on the level that we want to produce ""The Change,"" yet it is also a large amount of money to attempt to crowdfund. If we do not reach our goal, hopefully we will be significantly closer to it than we are now so that we can work to supplement ourselves. We will do the best with what we have.

Other Ways You Can Help
A final element that we would love to have in ""The Change"" are per-episode sponsorships.  If you or someone you know is a business owner and would like to make a tax-deductible donation to one of the non-profits we work with you can use this show as a medium to do so.  
It is understood that financial contributions cannot always be made.  We also value support given by spreading this campaign by sharing our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and IMDB pages.
Thank you so much for your time and we hope you are able to be a part of ""The Change!""
Sincerely,
Steven Crocker

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>  We are Weebl's Stuff, an animation company that makes silly cartoons and songs for both your ears and eyes. It's recently become extremely difficult for small companies like ours to distribute top quality content, because the usual outlets for this no longer reward smaller companies for the time and effort to get this work done. Increasingly we rely on our fanbase and reputation to help us make this content. Luckily for us, you guys have always been incredibly supportive, something we really appreciate.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why BAD Advice?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>  </strong>We get fan requests for content on a regular basis and BAD Advice has become the most requested. We have the ideas for a new set of five episodes, but unfortunately not the resources. With your help we can get these made and get the writers and animators paid for doing it. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need the funds to pay for the creation of the videos. That means initial writing and editing, the basic animation, voice work and finishing. The contribution we get will hopefully lead to all five episodes being made. Less might mean we can only make one or two. For your contribution you can see the final pieces when they're made. We will run all names of contributors in the end credits, because we think you deserve it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Put very simply, without you there is no second series of BAD Advice. We don't have the funds to make it and make sure everyone involved is paid for their part. So your contribution means everything to us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk as mentioned would be to not get full funding. Then we'd have to decide how best to allocate the funds to make sure we can get something made. We have an amazing, trusted team, so we know once the funds are in we can crack on and get these made. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Obviously telling people about our campaign would be a great help. Thank you</p>

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>Greetings! My name is Khalil Perry and I'm the owner of <strong>Persist Print</strong>. We are an independent media source on lifestyle and culture amongst the 5 boroughs of NYC. Since 2015, we have been producing a non profit documentary series that entails all of the gems and authentic content that surrounds the five boroughs. So far, we have built up a strong and organic following behind releasing the first 3 chapters of this series by: word of mouth around NYC, event marketing and a solid social media presence. Please see the links above to view our various episodes and social media content below if you have not. </p>
<p>As our followers know, the first three chapters of our series were 8 videos, each being very detailed and pertaining to: the pros and cons of NYC living, lifestyles and cultures within and amongst the 5 boroughs, and the diverse world of NYC artistry. Our content serves as both entertaining and educational. </p>
<p>Chapters 4-9 will include approximately 12+ more videos that will focus on even more specific topics including: sex, gender and relationships, the melting pot culture, the economy that drives NYC, nightlife, social and political issues from around the 5 boroughs, the various holiday seasons and an interview by the creators behind this docu-series. (You can see more information about our docu web-series and its nine chapters at our website here: <a href=""http://www.persistprint.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.persistprint.com</a>). </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Persist Print has come a LONG way since our initial launch in 2015. We have learned so much through various trials and eras, and couldn't be more excited to say that we are growing in the correct direction! When we first started this brand, we wanted to show the world how diverse and captivating our home environment is. Eventually, it grew to be even bigger than that, as it began serving as an educative and sociological project on life in the big city. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, <strong>WE NEED YOU to get across the finish line</strong>. Being a small team of a handful of friends from NYC who have gathered this much independent success around our project, it should show how serious we are about being positive contributors to the world.  We have already made connections in the world of media linking up with the following since the launch of PP: <i>Showtime Networks, Disney , MLB.com , OvationTV, BronxNet,  Martin Luther School - Maspeth, Queens Central Library, legendary NYC artists, FlipdaScript Podcast, and other influencers and publications from around the world. </i></p>
<p>We are hoping that the completion of #NYCVisDoc will set the tone for us to do even better and more interesting productions in the near future as we continue to grow our media brand! The value in creative media and a connection to the people of the world will forever be our goal here at Persist Print!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Luckily for us, we have completed most of the projects filming and editing. Therefore, our biggest challenge is the completion of our project in a timely matter, while using the most efficient tools possible. Regardless if we reach our goal or not, we still plan to release the remaining docu-episodes. However, it will just be at a slower rate and a lower production quality. In a society where constant content and high production is a must in the world of interactive media, we don't want to fall behind the standards of our following. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>Desconocidxs, es un equipo de estudiantes que se dedica actualmente a la grabación de una web serie. Es nuestro primer proyecto a lo grande, por ello, queremos hacerlo lo más profesional posible. De esta manera, sois vosotros los que podéis hacerlo realidad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>El presupuesto que queremos recaudar no es demasiado elevado (alrededor de 500-600€), sin embargo es lo que necesitamos por capítulo para la debida grabación. Esto significa que queremos traeros lo mejor de lo mejor.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Nicole O. Johnson, I am better known as Harriyanna Hook on YouTube. I am a an actor, writer, blogger, and model. I am a theatre major at Clayton State University. I have been in numerous short films and have featured on The CW shows, Black Lightning, and Legacies. I have been a big fan of Disney's Descendants since they announced that they would be making it. Descendants is a very important part of my life as it has helped me during my hardships. Because of these I have made amazing friends and have gotten wonderful opportunities. </p>
<p>One thing about Descendants is that I loved the characters. Everyone was so interesting and I began to write about them in my free time. I put my stories up for people to read, and many have enjoyed them. I've been wanting to bring my stories to life for about a year now; I finally have built up the courage to do so. I am currently developing a fan series called, The Progenies.</p>
<p>This show is not only for me, but for the fans. Descendants has a large 18 and up fan base and they were so excited when I announced I was going to be making a more realistic a mature version of the franchise. I love acting and writing so much it would mean the world for me to be able to do that with something I adore.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Any donation will help. We need funds for props, water, snacks, transportation, locations, costumes, and materials we need to keep everyone safe because of Covid-19; such as face masks, soaps, individually packaged meals, hand sanitizer, wipes. We pulled the money together ourselves to film the pilot, and it cost us over $2,500. We have twelve more episodes of season one to film. It is going to cost us more throughout the season as more characters will be introduced.  It's looking like we will need around $30,000. I can put $5,000 of my own money towards it to get it down to $25,000. But even it we don't meet out goal, I have grateful for whatever we get. We will find a way for this show to still happen. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've expressed numerous times on my channel and blog that Descendants represents many of their characters of color poorly. We are adding the much need diversity to this show along with other social issues that need to be talked about from childhood trauma, toxic friendships, being a caregiver for your siblings, mental illness, and making terrible mistakes that hurt those you love the most. We are making this show as a giveback to the fans who have felt as if this franchise portrayed them in a negative light, and to see their favorite character in a different perspective. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are taking the chance on numerous actors of color to contribute to this fictional world. We know that many people will have an issue with the things discussed in the show, but that's life. There will be no nudity or sexual content, but their will be scenes that are very emotional. Descendants never went too deep with it came to feelings and we are taking that next step to make it powerful. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, I completely understand. Sharing out project with the public is great. We aren't making this show for the money, we are making it for the fans. Getting the word out to other people means the world to us. The Progenies is a gift to Descendants fans. The fanbase may be small, but we just want to let them know that we see them, and we care.</p>

<p>We started our goal at $500 week one and smashed our goal!</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Produced by Mya Stengel and Julia Stitely, Fathoms Below is a coming-of-age ICTV series that follows the adventures of Syd and Kai, freshman roommates as they navigate college life, and the ambitious biology professor Harris Hawthorne, all the while keeping the secret that one of them is a mermaid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mya Stengel is a freshman attending Ithaca college in order to learn more about Writing in Hollywood and audio production. Fathoms Below became important to her when her friend Julia Stitely proposed the idea of a mermaid show. A month passed before the pilot was written and submitted and another month before they heard the news of their acceptance. Since then Mya has spent every week putting hours and work into creating this project. Building a team, creating a cast, and writing scripts. She could not be more excited to see how the show turns out!</li>
<li>Julia Stitely is a Writing for Film, TV, and Emerging Media major at Ithaca College, hoping to learn more and write scripts that will tell important stories. Fathoms Below started because of her and her friend, Mya’s, passion for wanting to do a mermaid show. When the opportunity came, they jumped at the chance. Every day has been dedicated to writing and making the show come to life and that help couldn’t be done without the hard work from the team. </li>
<li>Though without help from our contributors we cannot mirror the excitement and thrill of this fantasy world quite as much. With only a few contributions we will be able to fly higher than we ever expected to before and build an immersive world of college, magic, and mermaids! She can't wait to see the magic happen!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So to break it down--</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, we have a starting budget of $100 dollars provided to us by our school, but our goal is to reach a budget of $500 dollars by September.</li>
<li>Some things that we have already begun to list as a production necessity include a somewhat realistic mermaids tail fitted to our main actor, a medium-sized outdoor pool, and some cheap lab equipment. Though we do also know we will need multiple outfits for our cast along with props to fill the scene and college decor to decorate our sets.</li>
<li>Once the show completes the post-production stage we will be able to release episodes for anyone to watch. Meaning that you will be able to see what your contributions did for us on-screen while also enjoying a delightful and thrilling story along the way!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fathoms Below has been a passion project for months now, starting out as a shared joke and what has now become a reality! We cannot wait to present the struggles and triumphs of Syd and Kai on-screen next semester</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is an Ithaca College-supported television production so there are little to no risks involved. One way or another this series will be made!

</div></div>","Who are we?
JA & M Productions Inc,  is a television production company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  We are dedicated  to producing socially relevant, edgy and energetic content, primarily for dramatic television.  J A & M proudly presents Geography Club - The Television Series.
Based on the acclaimed novel by Brent Hartinger,  this series is an adaptation of the feature film, released in 2013.  Set in the mountainous backdrop and high plains of Goodkind, Idaho,  the series  follows the lives of Russell Middlebrook, and his friends,  as they journey through adolescence and young adulthood, and encounter triumph and tragedy, and love and loss along the way.
Geography Club talks about the importance of community, friendship and finding strength in a scary, and difficult point in one's life, most notably high school.  The universal theme  that we can all relate to is no matter what you're going through in life,  be true to yourself  and let who you are shine through.
The team behind this production, includes the executive producers of the feature film,  Frederick Levy & Bryan Leder.   Edmund Entin  and Gary Entin have penned  a script that  is emotional, dramatic, sexy and shocking.
A number of actors from the feature film, will be reprising their roles.  You will also see a new class of students at Goodkind High, each bringing their own story to the series.
Contributors will help us produce the premiere episode of Geography Club. It will help us fund this project so we can continue the story, which fans have been waiting for, for so long.
What We Need:
All the funds will be used in the creation of Geography Club-The Television Series, episode #1.
Why Donate?
Join us on our journey back to  Goodkind, Idaho.  You'll see familiar faces, new beginnings and  stories that will motivate, inspire, and tug at the heart strings!!
You will be eligible to receive rewards exclusive to those pledging through this Indiegogo page. Have a look at the rewards column -  getting a perk is like placing a pre-order for the project once it's done.

<h3>What is Shot Reverse Shot?</h3>
<p>We are a student-run organization based out of the University of Missouri - Columbia with the sole goal with giving students the experience of creating serialized content in the form of a web series. More simply put, we try to make a web series every single year! Earlier in 2018 we released our first show, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSdh7NdArJw"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Grand Theft Autumn</i></a>, and now we're excited to bring you <i>Down The Rabbit Hole</i> in <strong>April 2019</strong>! </p>
<p>One issue though...we're poor college students. That's where you come in! SRS wants to give you the chance to help us create a memorable and fun experience that everyone can enjoy. Our cast and crew has put in a lot of hard work and countless hours to make <i>Down The Rabbit Hole</i> a reality and your assistance can help improve our quality while also allowing you to become an essential part of our team.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our goal is simple. We need to fund the production of each of our episodes. Until this point each director has been paying for props, catering, and materials for their episodes and often spending hundreds of dollars in the process. </p>
<p>If our goal is met we can help reduce the amount of money straight from our pockets and hopefully allow SRS to focus on our continual growth. Here's where we hope to be spending the money we raise.</p>
<p>Of the $2000 dollars we hope to raise:</p>
<p>$600 is going towards <strong>Props</strong> and <strong>Costumes</strong>.</p>
<p>$400 is going towards <strong>Craft Services</strong> and <strong>Food.</strong></p>
<p>$200 dollars is going towards <strong>Equipment Necessities</strong>. (batteries, mole skins, etc.).</p>
<p>$200 is going towards creating and delivering <strong>YOUR rewards</strong>!</p>
<p>$100 is going towards <strong>Website Management</strong>.</p>
<p>$100 is going towards <strong>Promotional Fees</strong>.</p>
<p>$100 is going towards <strong>Indie GoGo Fees.</strong></p>
<p>Which leaves us with <strong>$300 dollars worth of Safety Net Funds</strong> just in case things go wrong.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545336898/wr8vudfpvqljzjaoax0r.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Even if we don't make it to our goal we will allocate the money where it needs to go so that we can make the best show possible. </p>
<h3>Now let's talk <strong>REWARDS</strong>
</h3>
<p>We know that you don't have to donate money to us, so that fact that you're even considering it means so much to us. We thought long and hard about what we could offer you to make it worth your while, and we think they're pretty good. A lot of the rewards are designed to be personal and interesting gifts that will hopefully make this process positive and memorable for you! </p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shout Out Videos</li>
<li>Character Portraits</li>
<li>Postcard Poems</li>
<li>DVDs</li>
<li>T-Shirts</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Shot Reverse Shot's primary focus is to give authentic and educational training for future filmmakers at the University of Missouri. It's an incredibly valuable and rewarding experience for all those involved and we hope to continue this tradition in the future. It's our goal to bring together a creative community that can work together to make something that they can truly be proud of. <i><strong>YOUR</strong></i> donation helps us make this possible, and for that we truly thank you. </p>

<p>This project started almost a year ago when we launched a screenwriting contest at DePaul University with the aim of connecting writers with production students by asking them to write an original series . The prize? Getting their series produced. This is the execution of that promise.</p>
<p>This opportunity is unique in that it gives us as students the opportunity to produce something very close to that of a TV show at least in style, structure and story if not in length. This is the best way for a lot of students to experience something simply not available to them if not for this opportunity since most TV shows would only allow them to intern or be an assistant, this allows us to gain experience in real roles doing the work film professionals really do.</p>

<p>The show is about Amy Laurel, a small town florist who was mistreated by her ex husband, Jasper Teller who she used to run the her flower shop with. This begins her quest to rid the world of cheaters and abusers. To do it she uses her unique knowledge of plants and their many poisons in an attempt to hide her trail. As tension mounts and the police close in, Amy's criteria for killing become broader and broader.  What will happen if the police find out who the killer really is?</p>

<p>$8000 may seem like a lot of money, but for a production this size thats a very boot strap budget. We are getting our equipment for free from DePaul which saves us a significant portion of money. However, producing a  five episode series that totals around 35 minutes costs quite a bit of money across food/transportation for our 20+ person crew,  the cast, location fees, costumes,  dressing our amazing sets and props.  Point is, all money donated goes directly to support production of the show and to do such a great script justice requires a lot of resources.

</div></div>","This project started almost a year ago when we launched a screenwriting contest at DePaul University with the aim of connecting writers with production students by asking them to write an original series . The prize? Getting their series produced. This is the execution of that promise.
This opportunity is unique in that it gives us as students the opportunity to produce something very close to that of a TV show at least in style, structure and story if not in length. This is the best way for a lot of students to experience something simply not available to them if not for this opportunity since most TV shows would only allow them to intern or be an assistant, this allows us to gain experience in real roles doing the work film professionals really do.

The show is about Amy Laurel, a small town florist who was mistreated by her ex husband, Jasper Teller who she used to run the her flower shop with. This begins her quest to rid the world of cheaters and abusers. To do it she uses her unique knowledge of plants and their many poisons in an attempt to hide her trail. As tension mounts and the police close in, Amy's criteria for killing become broader and broader.  What will happen if the police find out who the killer really is?

<p>Where small-town gym meets big personalities. This is a comedy short about the quirks and qualities of gym life. Taking place at the locally owned (and sort of gay) U Ran Us (Pronounced Uranus) Fitness, we discover a world where Chad, the well-meaning but clueless ""bro"" trainer meets Kevin, a new member trudging his way through his mid-life crisis. (think ""Odd Couple"" but in a gym) Along the way we meet Gina, Logan, Cheryl, Wesley and Sam. We learn that their desires and unchecked personality quirks have lead this colorful blend of characters to bond together through a deep and meaningful life of pure superficiality, and relatable comedy!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>DragonGem Productions has been producing short and feature films for years, and we're excited to finally have an opportunity to produce a show for Bell Media.  Lyndon Horsfall and Duncan Finnigan have been working on the initial concept of ""Kitchener Sync"" since 2015, and we think we have a hilarious, poignant and entertaining show to bring to your TV via FibeTV1 in 2018!</p>
<p>Your support means that - when all is said and done - we'll be putting forward a great, broadcast quality show; with the amazingly talented original cast, incredibly talented film professionals on our crew, shot on the best production equipment, and in great locations across Kitchener.  This kind of quality is expensive, and your contributions will help us support the production of the show - and you'll get to share in the journey along the way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're hoping with your help, we can hit our $30,000 goal. There are a tonne of expenses on a production, but we're keeping it pretty lean. But here's where you come in as a supporter of our campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major expenses are the industry standard cameras, gear, and lighting equipment needed to shoot a television show, and the incidentals that go with using said equipment. We've been lucky enough to get a lot of help from William F. Whites International Inc. to offset the costs, and we're continuing to work on partnerships to help keep the production costs manageable.</li>
<li>Many of these funds will go to paying our cast and crew fair, industry standard rates for their long, hard days.  Camera operators, sound techs, gaffers, grips, production managers and designers, and a whole group of professional people will be putting in 10+ hour days to make the best show possible for your enjoyment!</li>
<li>Some of these funds will go to cover the cost of food to keep that cast and crew fueled and happy during the shooting days!</li>
<li>You'll see some pretty cool perks in the various perk packages. We're very much about the experience. It's great to share the final product with you, but as a supporter, we want you to be able to experience the journey with us! And of course, get some awesome stuff along the way!</li>
<li>Every bit helps! As such, even if we don't hit our goal of $30,000, the show will go on with the funds that have been raised. (We're hoping we reach the $30,000 though!)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone knows about the main Silicon Valley over in California. But do they know about Canada's Tech Capital - Kitchener?</p>
<p>We, Duncan and I, got together in 2015 after our successful “12 Angry Filmmakers” project, which produced 14 highly acclaimed short films from around the Waterloo Region, to decide what our next project would be.</p>
<p>It was during a roundtable meeting at the centre of Kitchener's tech capital, Communitech, we discussed how Kitchener was then starting to be called the “Silicon Valley of the North” and the “Tech Capital of Canada.”  Realizing there was great potential in telling a fictional story in those surroundings, “Kitchener Sync” was born.</p>
<p>We quickly produced three spec episodes of the show, with an incredibly talented cast and highly skilled and professional film crew, and were supported by William F. Whites International Inc., AJA Video Systems, The Commons Studio &amp; Lighthouse Equipment Ltd., and Guelph’s Ed Video Media Arts Centre, among others. It was highly encouraging that these leaders in the industry saw the potential in our show. Even more encouraging knowing that Bell Media's FibeTV1  also saw it, believed in it, and will now be making the completed first season available for streaming!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've put together a team that has years of experience in the entertainment production field.  This means we have people on our team who have experience staying on budget with a production. We have people on our team who have experience keeping a production on schedule. And we have people on our team who have the experience to take great things from script to screen.</p>
<p>Some obstacles we could face are additional shooting days, or having to shoot on a much leaner budget. We are hoping with your help, we can get a little breathing room. To also help off set costs, we have a team that is actively working on in-kind sponsorship. Every little bit helps. And the dedication of this team to all aspects of this production is what will get the job done!</p>

<p>Hi everybody!</p>
<p>We are taking it as a good sign from the universe that you have chosen to visit our Indiegogo page. So let’s make it worth your while!</p>
<p>So, who are we? We are a team of three: Robin Cleland, Zoe Cleland and Carly Sztern. We are all actors who have been living and working in Toronto for the past decade. Robin and Zoe are a father-daughter team and Carly is an honorary member of the family. All three of us have always been interested in all things spooky, and for many years Robin has also been a well-known tarot reader. A few months ago, the idea for <i>Ace of Rods</i> popped into our heads, and ever since then we have been striving to turn it into a reality that everyone can enjoy.</p>
<p><i>Ace of Rods</i> is a story about James Castleton, an eccentric psychic, who one day is visited by a woman named Sally who claims to be his long-lost daughter. He lets her into his home, having no idea that she brings with her a storm of chaos and danger. </p>
<p>We are writing ten ten-minute episodes that will lead you through this twisted tale of mischief and magic. It will be a unique experience for the viewer—think <i>Breaking Bad</i> meets<i> Ghost</i>—mixing comedy, suspense and the supernatural. With your help, we want to raise the money to shoot our pilot episode. We want our first episode to be a kick-ass introduction to our show, with a high production value that will maximize the entertainment for the viewer. There is no limit to what we can achieve with this, and the better our first episode is, the more chance we have of drawing the support that will help us bring the rest of our season to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $22,000. We have carefully compiled our budget so that we can pay everyone involved with <i>Ace of Rods</i>. This includes expenses for cast, crew, equipment, location, set design, costumes, catering, stunt coordination and editing.  </p>
<p>We want to set a high bar for our pilot in order to give <i>Ace of Rods</i> the best shot at becoming a full season of magic. We feel it’s important to pay a fair wage to everyone involved for their skills and talent. We have been economical where possible, but have given ourselves a higher budget in some areas (such as camera equipment) so that we aren’t making any artistic sacrifices.</p>
<p>You won’t regret helping us out! As well as getting to see our exciting final product, donors will be treated to a selection of very special perks. These include everything from a personalized message from the universe to our team hosting you and your friends to a delicious dinner followed by individual readings from our very own Robin Cleland.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>As we said, we need $22,000 to shoot our pilot. However, with even more funding, the sky is the limit as to what we can achieve! Here’s a sneak peek at what we could do if your support takes us to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>$30,000</strong></p>
<p>For $30,000, we could not only shoot our pilot, but also hire someone to help us publicize it to the fullest, and launch a marketing campaign to reach the widest possible audience. Not only this, but we would have extra money to increase our spending on things like set dressing, costumes and special effects. Help us make the experience of <i>Ace of Rods</i> even more magical!</p>
<p><strong>$60,000 </strong></p>
<p>For $60,000, we could shoot our first three episodes. This would help us launch our show with a much bigger impact, and of course it would also provide even more entertainment for you, the viewer!</p>
<p><strong>$200,000</strong></p>
<p>For $200,000, we could shoot our entire first season. We would be able to give you ten episodes of <i>Ace of Rods</i> to binge on. Then you could follow James, Sally and Annie through all the twists and turns of their thrilling and hilarious adventures without having to press the pause button. Hang on for a wild ride!</p>
<h3>Where will your money go if we don’t reach our goal?</h3>
<p>We are going to make <i>Ace of Rods</i> happen no matter what! Even if we don’t reach our goal here on Indiegogo, we will continue crowdfunding until we raise the necessary funds. </p>
<p>There are two worst-case scenarios.​ O​ne would be that we would have to delay production by a few months. The other would come into play if we are ​only able to raise $18,000.​ In this second case, we could still shoot our pilot,​ but it​ would mean using much lower-quality cameras and paying some of our team members a lot less than their time is worth. We want to avoid this​ at all costs! (N​o pun intended!​) </p>
<p>Either way, we will keep all our backers informed of our shooting schedule and progress. Rest assured that any money you donate will go to the production of our spooky,​ funny and completely original web series—<i>Ace of Rods</i>.</p>
<h3>What’s Our Track Record?</h3>
<p>It comes down to this, why should you trust us with your money? As psychic as we are, not all aspects of the future can be divined completely! However, we can tell you what we have accomplished in the past, and you can decide for yourself. All of our core team members have extensive experience in the industry, with many different specialties between us.</p>
<p>Although much of his life has been devoted to his psychic work, Robin Cleland has made his mark in the acting world in a very short period of time. Most notably, he has appeared in acclaimed shows <i>Taken </i>and <i>Alias Grace</i>. Robin also single–handedly wrote, produced and starred in his original one-man show <i>Don’t Look Down</i> at the Berkeley Street Theatre in 2011.</p>
<p>Our co-director and director of photography, Trish Young, is an award-winning DP. After receiving the CSC Award For Best Cinematography in a student film category, she has been sponsored by numerous companies and has had the opportunity of working on a vast array of projects. She has boundless energy that she brings with her everywhere she goes!</p>
<p>Zoe Cleland is a classically trained actress who has been working in the industry for most of her life. She has been featured in many well-known shows, including <i>Murdoch Mysteries, Reign, </i>and <i>Saving Hope,</i> as well as the award-winning indie comedy <i>How to Plan an Orgy in a Small Town</i>. Zoe also produced and starred in her own adaptation of Chekhov’s <i>Uncle Vanya </i>in a site-specific production in 2013.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Carly Sztern has had a particularly unique view of the industry. She recently appeared in <i>Karla, </i>a romantic comedy that premiered earlier this year. She has also entered the world of casting, where she has worked for Forrest &amp; Forrest Casting as well as Larissa Mair Casting &amp; Associates. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i>Ace of Rods</i> is a passion project, so of course it comes with a unique set of challenges. We have a very clear artistic vision that has a lot of momentum behind it, but we need the financial backing to go hand-in-hand with the energy of our ideas.  We believe our show deserves the highest production quality we can possibly give it, and that means hiring the best team. In order to do that we need your support so that we can make the experience of working on <i>Ace of Rods</i> worth their while.</p>
<p>We believe in the strength of our story. We have landed on a very special idea and we are determined to make it a reality no matter what. Every single person involved in our project feels just as strongly as we do, and we feel confident that that kind of artistic passion will carry us through to our final goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Ace of Rods </i>will be a show that will surprise and delight the viewer. It will be unique in its combination of wildly imaginative and magical storylines right alongside topical themes of crime and corruption. Our bottom line is entertainment: we want to make a show that you can’t wait to binge on: a distraction from your day-to-day life that will give you a shot of adrenaline and make you laugh at the same time.</p>
<p>Please give today and help us bring the SPIRIT of our eerie show into the light!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please contribute to our campaign! We are grateful for all donations, big or small.</p>
<p>We do understand that not everyone is in a position to give money. If that’s the case for you, that’s ok! Anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated. Please consider sharing our campaign, following us on social media, and of course watching <i>Ace of Rods </i>when it’s released. </p>

On the private lands in the park live about 100,000 year-round residents, all of them hardy and a great many quirky and ferociously independent. To live in the midst of the most extensive temperate deciduous forest on the planet, they endure long cold winters, swarms of biting insects, and a rugged, rocky, frost-haunted landscape that defies inhabitants of all species to eke out their livings.</p><p>It's a hard place to prosper. Yet for all the rocky patches, the people who dare to live inside the park are well rewarded by grand scenery, abundant wildlife, and no end of free entertainment in the form of skiing, skating, snowshoeing, hiking, boating, swimming, berry picking, fishing, hunting, and gardening (although it's not always easy to produce a ripe tomato here.)</p><p>The aim of our project is high.

<p>For many in the Adirondacks, the bullhead was the original fish, the one that gave the first sweet taste of fishing and its gastronomic and spiritual rewards. The bullhead is a fish to be admired, not only for its tender flesh, but also for its industrious nest-building and the devotion of both parents to the young.

<p>If Thornton Wilder had looked a little further west, he might have set his Pulitzer Prize-winning play ""Our Town"" not in Grover's Corners, New Hampshire but in the Adirondack Mountain village of Bloomingdale. In the 1840s, the banks of Sumner Brook, a humble tributary of the Saranac, gave rise to a settlement that flourishes---quietly and soulfully, in the vein of ""Our Town""---to this day. Bloomingdale has had its ups and downs. Yet from the playground and ballfield behind the fire house to its once-grand Main Street and two placid cemeteries, this is a place where people live, love, raise families, grow old, and return to the Earth with dignity, sustained through it all by a devotion to home and neighbors.</p>

On the private lands in the park live about 100,000 year-round residents, all of them hardy and a great many quirky and ferociously independent. To live in the midst of the most extensive temperate deciduous forest on the planet, they endure long cold winters, swarms of biting insects, and a rugged, rocky, frost-haunted landscape that defies inhabitants of all species to eke out their livings.It's a hard place to prosper. Yet for all the rocky patches, the people who dare to live inside the park are well rewarded by grand scenery, abundant wildlife, and no end of free entertainment in the form of skiing, skating, snowshoeing, hiking, boating, swimming, berry picking, fishing, hunting, and gardening (although it's not always easy to produce a ripe tomato here.)The aim of our project is high. That is, to do this place and its singular people justice.

It all flows smoothly, largely thanks to the hard work of lock tender Margaret Hawthorn. The Upper Locks operate the old-fashioned way, with muscle and finesse. Margaret loves the job and does it with a skill and passion that make a passage through the Upper Locks an experience long remembered.

They Prowl By Night: Seeking The Wild Adirondack Bullhead

For many in the Adirondacks, the bullhead was the original fish, the one that gave the first sweet taste of fishing and its gastronomic and spiritual rewards. The bullhead is a fish to be admired, not only for its tender flesh, but also for its industrious nest-building and the devotion of both parents to the young. Hook one, and you may be hooked for life.
Ampersand Mountain, Queen Of The Saranac Lake Six

Ampersand Mountain in the Adirondacks is hardly a bump on the landscape compared to the great mountains of the West. Even by Adirondack standards, it's barely more than humble. Yet its rewards are as good as they get: diverse old woods rich in birds and wildflowers, and after a steep climb, one that will give you a week's cardiovascular exercise in an hour or two, a view that ranks among the finest in the East.

You Can Get Anything You Want: On Schroon Lake, A Classic American General Store Still Thrives

Building on a history stretching back more than 150 years, the Adirondack General Store flourishes in the twenty-first century by offering the best of the old and the new. Proprietors Maureen and Robert Diaz made a bold move from Queens to the remote hamlet of Adirondack to buy and run the place. They sell everything from fishing poles to corn flakes and microbrew for grown-ups to retro candy for the kids. If you're hungry, they'll even serve you a home-cooked meal. This is the kind of place you pop in to grab a jar of pickles, and you wind up spending half a day browsing the aisles, chewing the fat with neighbors by the woodstove, meeting travelers, and reveling in the fine food and the old-time hardwood interior. Learn more at www.adkgeneralstore.com.
Canvas, Pain, And Wood: How Artist Paul Masson Brings Nature Alive In His Art

At the end of World War II, Paul Casson was given advice by friends: to soothe frazzled nerves he should take up painting. More than seventy years later, he's still at it, finding joy and serenity in capturing the beauty of nature with brush and oil. He carves and paints, birds, too, his work combining the delicate aesthetic sensibilities of an artist with the sturdy know-how of a naturalist and hunter.
Going ""Ollywood"": How A Modern Adirondack Sawmill Produces Old-Time Forest Products

A scientist turned sawyer named Ollie Burgess turns trees into rustic building materials in the northern Adirondack township of St. Armand. It's a bustling business. On one hand the yard and buildings at Specialty Wood Products appear straight out of the nineteenth century. On the other, Ollie and his team incorporate modern technology at every turn. Whether it's rough-sawn native lumber or a mortise-and-tenon-jointed cedar railing, if it's on a delivery truck bound for a building site in the United States, there's a good chance it's ""Ollywood."" Learn more at www.specialtywoodproductsadk.com.

Golly, Wally: Giant Beavers Still Surviving In The Adirondacks

For years, skeptics laughed and groaned while sightings and signs of an enormous aquatic rodent in the Adirondacks multiplied. Those who believe in the creature have come to agree that it's a giant beaver, Castoroides ohioensis, believed extinct for 11,000 years or more. If evidence pointing toward its presence can stand up to scrutiny, the black-bear-sized giant beaver may be making a comeback. Or not. It's your call!
For Whom The ""Bel"" Tolls: Saranac Lake's Belvedere Restaurant Keep Patrons Coming Back

Satisfying appetites and quenching thirsts since 1933, the Belvedere Restaurant throbs with activity in the heart of the Adirondack village of Saranac Lake. The Cavallo family founded the business. Eighty-five years later, they still run it proudly. With offerings ranging from Italian dishes made from old family recipes to the latest high-hopped microbrews, the ""Bel,"" as loyal patrons call it, offers a delicious escape from the mad, mad world. Here the raging river of time slows to a sane pace, and the chicken parmigiana is always as warm as the welcome. Give The Belvedere a ""LIKE"" on Facebook.

Upstairs in a room devoted to their art and craft, the quilters enjoy the pleasures of friendship while piecing and stitching to raise funds for charity.
Woods, Rocks, And A View To Live For: Saint Regis Mountain In The Adirondacks

Tucked here and there among the celebrated Adirondack forty-six high peaks, lesser mountains offer hikers bigger bangs for the energy required to climb them. The best of the least may well be St. Regis Mountain.

All Roads Lead To Bloomingdale: 19th Century Crossroads Village Blooms Anew In The 21st Century

If Thornton Wilder had looked a little further west, he might have set his Pulitzer Prize-winning play ""Our Town"" not in Grover's Corners, New Hampshire but in the Adirondack Mountain village of Bloomingdale. In the 1840s, the banks of Sumner Brook, a humble tributary of the Saranac, gave rise to a settlement that flourishes---quietly and soulfully, in the vein of ""Our Town""---to this day. Bloomingdale has had its ups and downs. Yet from the playground and ballfield behind the fire house to its once-grand Main Street and two placid cemeteries, this is a place where people live, love, raise families, grow old, and return to the Earth with dignity, sustained through it all by a devotion to home and neighbors.
A Whole Lotta Flutterin' Goin' On: Butterflies Fly At The Paul Smith's VIC Butterfly House

It's in Paul Smith's, at the Visitor Interpretive Center run by Paul Smith's College, right next door. Prepare to be amazed!  
A Taste Of Oak: Adirondack Coopers Bring Flavor To Regional Whiskey

Along a country road and down a long gravel driveway, Adirondack coopers Bob Hockert and Justin Bidelspach make world-class barrels fit for aging fine whiskies. They begin with select white oak boards cut by sawyers to their specifications. In the end, after much shaving, joining, charring, assembling, and the pressing on of hoops, a barrel is born---handsome, shapely, supremely practical, and prized by a rapidly expanding array of regional distillers.

Kids As Pets: Why Your Next 'Dog' Might Be A Goat

In the Adirondacks, people love their pets. Some of them---the pets, that is---weigh two hundred pounds or more and thrive on pine needles, poison-ivy, and other delicacies you can't buy at the supermarket. Ask these animals to sit up like trained dogs, and they'll say Naaaaaaaaaaaa. Yes, goats! For many of us, they are the pet of choice, and some earn livings or parts of livings raising and milking them, too. Learn more about Asgaard Farm & Dairy by visiting www.asgaardfarm.com.
The Adirondack Mountain Village Of Saranac Lake Remembers Its Curative Past

Most of us have heard William Faulkner's famous line about the past not being dead. His wisdom is nowhere more apparent than in the Adirondack Mountain village of Saranac Lake. Here, from the 1880s to the 1950s and a little bit beyond, tuberculosis patients arrived from near and far to rest on porches, breathe crisp pine-scented mountain air, and get well or die trying. Antibiotic therapy eventually put the village's sanitariums and cure cottages out of business. Still, in architecture, memory, story, and a heart-breaking poem penned by a brilliant young woman who didn't live to see it published, the village's rich past remains alive. Learn more about the work of Historic Saranac Lake by visiting www.historicsaranaclake.org.
Catch Our Drift: Why Adirondackers Love Winter, Sort OfDo we in the Adirondacks love snow and cold? Do we hate them? Hear dyed-in-the-wool locals speak their minds about our long, cold, crystalline season.Fifty Beds, Two Lakes, And An Otter: Bartlett's Hotel In Its Heyday, 1854-1884The late nineteenth century might be called the Golden Age of Adirondack Hotels. Among the humble and the grand, one establishment stands out above all the others for its character and for its characters: Virgil and Caroline Bartlett's Sportsmen's Home, which had its heyday from 1854 to 1884. ""Bartlett's,"" as the place was often called, stood at the downstream end of the Bartlett Carry between the Upper and Middle Saranac Lakes. Fran Yardley, a professional storyteller and author, has lived near the remote site of the hotel for more than forty years. She's our guide as Curiously Adirondack takes a look at a place renowned for its warm welcomes, delicious meals, cozy rooms, and pet otter.

It's all about firewood: felling it, sawing it to length, hauling it out of the woods, splitting it, moving it, stacking it, moving it again a time or two, and finally feeding it to hungry woodstoves. Yes, an unlucky few of us twirl thermostats, summon central heat, and hand over hard-earned cash to the oil and gas industry, but the rest of us maintain our trim figures, keep strong, and get free cardiovascular exercise as we work out at the most popular exercise club in the region.Intervale Lowlands: Biologist Larry Master Re-Wilds 135 Acres Near Lake PlacidIn 2009, biologist Larry Master and his then-wife, Nancy, bought 135 acres of woods, fields, flowing water, and floodplain near Lake Placid in the Adirondack Mountains. Their mission: to make the property sing with songbirds, to convert its mowed fields to meadows full of native plants and animals, and to identify and monitor its wildlife in an era of rapid climate change. They decided to call the place, tucked in an exquisite river valley between ranges of mountains, Intervale Lowlands.What Does The Moose Say?There are spelling bees. There are trivia contests.

Every year, the farmers celebrate their harvest and the community of life that made it possible by throwing a giant party, a sort of mini-Woodstock in the fields. It's called CrowFest. Join Curiously Adirondack as we mix and mingle with a curious cast of characters who tell the story of Fledging Crow Farm and who and what make it work.Asleep Beneath The Sod: Saranac Lake's Historic Pine Ridge Cemetery
Saranac Lake's Pine Ridge Cemetery sprawls over a sandy hillside in the heart of the village.

Join Curiously Adirondack in a ramble through the cemetery with the best of all possible guides: Natalie Leduc, one of the village's grand dames, a former Winter Carnival queen who looks after the cemetery and, when her rich and adventurous life is done, aims to be buried there.
Slimed! Adirondack Kids Love Amphibians

Adirondack kids can't resist slimy things that hop and crawl. Join three warm-blooded young naturalists as they hunt for frogs, toads, and salamanders. Don't think amphibians are cool? Maybe we can change your mind.

If you made it this far, perhaps you're interested. Great! And thank you.
Fundraising is tricky business. Let's be honest. Who enjoys asking for money? Still, ask we must--- because we believe in the value of Curiously Adirondack. Judging by the positive feedback we've received over the years, we know our storytelling resonates. So we hope you'll join us and find that supporting Curiously Adirondack is a little less painful than paying your monthly cable bill. Hundreds of channel choices are great. Yet not one of those channels highlights the Adirondacks like we do.
We're proud that our supporters always know where their money is going. We're just a couple of family guys trying to make a living, doing what we do best. Support of any sort means the world to us. Thank you!
When my wife Holly and I launched Josh Clement Productions two and a half years ago we did so with two goals in mind: to tell human-interest stories that focus on those who live, work, and play in the Adirondacks and to use the business and production skills we've gathered over the years to earn a dollar. Although not without its challenges, we've managed to thrive.
We've helped numerous institutions, organizations, and businesses reach video and web marketing goals. For that we are proud. Yet for us, all roads lead back to Curiously Adirondack. The series has generated excitement. The numbers are there to prove it. People ask, ""When can we see the next episode of Curiously Adirondack?"" Or they’ll say, ""I've got the perfect story idea for you guys. It would make a great Curiously Adirondack!"" I love that! The enthusiasm leaves me smiling . I know we're onto something special.
Which leads to the main point I wanted to make. Why does Curiously Adirondack work? Why is it essential to the success of Josh Clement Productions? The answer leads to my collaborator, my friend and neighbor, Ed Kanze. Putting together Curiously Adirondack is hard work. I could not do it alone. One needs only to look at the credits of any quality video production to realize what makes them shine. Ed Kanze is a seasoned storyteller, author, photographer, editor, and more. He is quick to praise what I bring to the table. For that I am most appreciative. Well, it goes both ways. I’m thrilled to be in his corner.
Ed and I will remain forever Curiously Adirondack! How about you?",11.0,25,"1 Campaign

His former home of Oakford, Georgia, was the hunting ground of a serial killer in his preteen years and his mother, Emily, was that killer’s final victim. His father, Victor, has been in prison for over a decade, supposedly having been the killer. When Tyler returns home to prove his father’s innocence after being sent away to survive the foster care system, he must deal with some old faces, both friendly and not so much. His theory is also bolstered by the emergence of a new, copycat serial killer. Nick Bradshaw will be directing the episode based on a teleplay by Andy Epsilantis, Joseph A. Reinhard, and Nick Pataky and a story by Andy Epsilantis and Benjamin Murray.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Breakdown</strong></h2><p>We have a talented cast, a thrilling script, some cool locations, and an imaginative director and crew on board.

</ol></div>","The ConceptIf you watched our pitch video, you already know this information verbatim, but in case you skipped that:Who Are You’s first season focuses on Tyler West, an investigative journalist whose life has been marred by unspeakable tragedy. His former home of Oakford, Georgia, was the hunting ground of a serial killer in his preteen years and his mother, Emily, was that killer’s final victim. His father, Victor, has been in prison for over a decade, supposedly having been the killer. When Tyler returns home to prove his father’s innocence after being sent away to survive the foster care system, he must deal with some old faces, both friendly and not so much. His theory is also bolstered by the emergence of a new, copycat serial killer. Nick Bradshaw will be directing the episode based on a teleplay by Andy Epsilantis, Joseph A. Reinhard, and Nick Pataky and a story by Andy Epsilantis and Benjamin Murray. BreakdownWe have a talented cast, a thrilling script, some cool locations, and an imaginative director and crew on board. What we need is to secure this final piece of the puzzle – our funding – so we can begin shooting in earnest. The amount we estimate we need in order to do that is $25,000 (USD), broken down as follows:

Cast and Crew: We need to pay everybody who's taking off work during our 13 days of production. We also have to cover their travel to Baltimore and their lodging expenses while they're here.

Production Costs: This means the rental cost of lighting equipment and camera equipment; purchasing hard drives, wardrobe, and whatever's needed for set design; covering craft food services; and any other incidentals that may come up.

Post-Production Costs: Editing, sound mixing, etc.

Indiegogo and Perks: We have to buy all the swag that you guys earned by donating to our cause. Indiegogo also takes a sliver of whatever we raise off the top.

<u>Synopsis de la série</u>     (english version below)</h3>
<p><i>«Monty Python rencontre Le Dôme»</i></p>
<p>Des extra-terrestres dans le village de Ste-Cravache ? Les relations amicales entre les villageois et les extra-terrestres font craindre au gouvernement la possibilité d’une invasion. Pour cette raison, la région est mise en quarantaine et les habitants sont surveillés de près par des scientifiques et des militaires depuis les années 80. Aucune communication extérieure n’est autorisée. Pour prévenir une insurrection, l’état créa une chaîne de propagande gouvernementale pour divertir et hypnotiser la population: Télévision Ste-Cravache (TVSC). </p>
<p><u>La campagne de  financement</u></p>
<p>En 2005, le réalisateur Nicolas Proulx invente Ste-Cravache. Le village est un terrain de jeu fertile pour les idées absurdes du cinéaste. De 2005 et 2014, ces lieux fictifs ont été élaborés à travers une quinzaine de courts métrages. En 2018, Nicolas se lance avec une équipe croyant à fond au scénario de la première saison. Parmi ces gens talentueux, les acteurs Dino Tavarone (Omerta, Le Piège américain, Minuit le soir) et Daniel Grenier (Les beaux malaises, Chick’n Swell, Un Gars, une fille) se sont joints à l’équipe pour jouer les rôles principaux de la série.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556671146/m522rz2wwfuizsxcia3v.jpg"" src=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556671206/gychwehzala0haa0oikp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>En tournant le pilote de l'émission, une vingtaine de professionnels ont mis tous les efforts afin de produire un pilote de qualité pour le public. L'épisode No.1 de TVSC sera disponible en projection privée pour certains contributeurs du projet (voir Perks). Ce sera VOUS les premiers à choisir si TVSC continue ou s'arrête au premier épisode (ouf !). Est-ce que la quarantaine va se poursuivre ? Est-ce que Jean-Jules (Dino Tavarone) découvrira la vérité sur les extra terrestres ? Que dire de Joe (Daniel Grenier) et son band «Les Salauds Aquatiks» ? Vont-ils retrouver la gloire de leur premier album ? </p>

<p><u>Son contenu </u></p>
<p>La série « TVSC » raconte l'histoire d'un peuple inconnu du monde entier en raison d'une quarantaine interminable. Le lien entre la réalité du village et ses habitants se fait par le contenu de la chaîne de télévision de Ste-Cravache. De prime abord, la structure des épisodes ressemble à celle d'un canal standard. En revanche, elle s'inscrit dans un contexte marginal. Du point de vue des habitants, l'enchaînement des émissions participe à leur identité propre. En adoptant la perspective des téléspectateurs, ceux-ci jugent les péripéties hilarantes, sans queue ni tête et tout à fait excentriques. D'un autre côté, certaines facettes, dans les coutumes du village, évoquent la réalité québécoise. Ainsi, par les moyens d'une satire sociétale ; la Télé-Cravanaise propose une grille horaire représentative des comportements aberrants et imprévisibles des villageois.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556671559/zranzla8kh982nhti2tt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>En présence d’une programmation aux circonstances inhabituelles, la formule de TVSC est un croisement entre «Key and Peele» et «Le Dôme». La série se démarque du fait que les sketches à la télévision de Ste-Cravache font le lien entre la réalité du village et les enjeux profonds des personnages principaux.</p>

<u>Synopsis</u>   </h3>
<p><i>«Monty Python meet The Dôme»</i></p>
<p>Aliens in the village of Ste-Cravache? The friendly relations between the villagers and the aliens make the government fear the possibility of an invasion. For this reason, the area is quarantined and residents have been closely monitored by scientists and military personnel since the 1980s. No outside communication is permitted. To prevent an uprising, the state created a chain of government propaganda to entertain and hypnotize the population: Television Ste-Cravache (TVSC).</p>

<p><u>The campaign</u></p>
<p>In 2005, director Nicolas Proulx invents Ste-Cravache. The village is a fertile playground for the absurd ideas of the filmmaker. From 2005 and 2014, these fictional places were developed through fifteen short films. In 2018, Nicolas took his own money for the production of the pilot. Actors Dino Tavarone (Omerta) and Daniel Grenier (Chick'n Swell) joined the team to play the main roles of the serie.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556672851/xpfjs9d4gg3dui1ylrhb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>About twenty professionals have made the sacrifice to work for free to produce the first episode. The first episode will be available in private projection for contributors (see Perks).

«Monty Python rencontre Le Dôme»
Des extra-terrestres dans le village de Ste-Cravache ? Les relations amicales entre les villageois et les extra-terrestres font craindre au gouvernement la possibilité d’une invasion. Pour cette raison, la région est mise en quarantaine et les habitants sont surveillés de près par des scientifiques et des militaires depuis les années 80. Aucune communication extérieure n’est autorisée. Pour prévenir une insurrection, l’état créa une chaîne de propagande gouvernementale pour divertir et hypnotiser la population: Télévision Ste-Cravache (TVSC). 
La campagne de  financement
En 2005, le réalisateur Nicolas Proulx invente Ste-Cravache. Le village est un terrain de jeu fertile pour les idées absurdes du cinéaste. De 2005 et 2014, ces lieux fictifs ont été élaborés à travers une quinzaine de courts métrages. En 2018, Nicolas se lance avec une équipe croyant à fond au scénario de la première saison. Parmi ces gens talentueux, les acteurs Dino Tavarone (Omerta, Le Piège américain, Minuit le soir) et Daniel Grenier (Les beaux malaises, Chick’n Swell, Un Gars, une fille) se sont joints à l’équipe pour jouer les rôles principaux de la série.  
En tournant le pilote de l'émission, une vingtaine de professionnels ont mis tous les efforts afin de produire un pilote de qualité pour le public. L'épisode No.1 de TVSC sera disponible en projection privée pour certains contributeurs du projet (voir Perks). Ce sera VOUS les premiers à choisir si TVSC continue ou s'arrête au premier épisode (ouf !). Est-ce que la quarantaine va se poursuivre ? Est-ce que Jean-Jules (Dino Tavarone) découvrira la vérité sur les extra terrestres ? Que dire de Joe (Daniel Grenier) et son band «Les Salauds Aquatiks» ? Vont-ils retrouver la gloire de leur premier album ? 

Son contenu 
La série « TVSC » raconte l'histoire d'un peuple inconnu du monde entier en raison d'une quarantaine interminable. Le lien entre la réalité du village et ses habitants se fait par le contenu de la chaîne de télévision de Ste-Cravache. De prime abord, la structure des épisodes ressemble à celle d'un canal standard. En revanche, elle s'inscrit dans un contexte marginal. Du point de vue des habitants, l'enchaînement des émissions participe à leur identité propre. En adoptant la perspective des téléspectateurs, ceux-ci jugent les péripéties hilarantes, sans queue ni tête et tout à fait excentriques. D'un autre côté, certaines facettes, dans les coutumes du village, évoquent la réalité québécoise. Ainsi, par les moyens d'une satire sociétale ; la Télé-Cravanaise propose une grille horaire représentative des comportements aberrants et imprévisibles des villageois.

En présence d’une programmation aux circonstances inhabituelles, la formule de TVSC est un croisement entre «Key and Peele» et «Le Dôme». La série se démarque du fait que les sketches à la télévision de Ste-Cravache font le lien entre la réalité du village et les enjeux profonds des personnages principaux.

C'est ici que votre contribution prend toute son importance. Vous avez regardé notre présentation et vous aimeriez voir la saison au complet ? Eh bien, c'est vous qui êtes les maîtres de la situation ! Vous avez le pouvoir de donner vie à Ste-Cravache. Les contributions ne sont pas des dons, au contraire, ce sont des récompenses vraiment tripantes ! Venez faire partie de Ste-Cravache et devenir un Cravanais et une Cravanaise !!

 
 

Synopsis   
«Monty Python meet The Dôme»
Aliens in the village of Ste-Cravache? The friendly relations between the villagers and the aliens make the government fear the possibility of an invasion. For this reason, the area is quarantined and residents have been closely monitored by scientists and military personnel since the 1980s. No outside communication is permitted. To prevent an uprising, the state created a chain of government propaganda to entertain and hypnotize the population: Television Ste-Cravache (TVSC).
  
The campaign
In 2005, director Nicolas Proulx invents Ste-Cravache. The village is a fertile playground for the absurd ideas of the filmmaker. From 2005 and 2014, these fictional places were developed through fifteen short films. In 2018, Nicolas took his own money for the production of the pilot. Actors Dino Tavarone (Omerta) and Daniel Grenier (Chick'n Swell) joined the team to play the main roles of the serie.

About twenty professionals have made the sacrifice to work for free to produce the first episode. The first episode will be available in private projection for contributors (see Perks). It will be YOU the first to choose if TVSC continues or stops at the first episode (please no!). Will quarantine continue in Ste-Cravache ? Will Jean-Jules (Dino Tavarone) discover the truth about aliens? What about Joe (Daniel Grenier) and his band "" The Aquatiks S.O.B.'s ""? Will they regain the glory of their first album ?

This is where your contribution becomes important. Have you watched our presentation ? Would you like to see the entire season ? Well, you are the masters of the situation! You have the power to give life to Ste-Cravache. Come and be part of Ste-Cravache and become a Cravanese and a Cravanaise !!",11.0,0,"2 Campaigns

I grew up between East Dulwich, Brixton and Peckham where my family still live and have watched its transformation from being predominately urban working class areas into thriving cultural hotspots. But this sudden change has resulted in soaring house prices, unaffordable rent, the closing of local businesses, and the displacement of communities.<br/>Even though I make a decent living as a writer I struggle to keep up with the rising costs of living in London. Like many people of my generation I’ve spent most of my young adult life renting, not because I wanted to but because it was the only option.</p><p>I felt inspired to write the series after seeing the hashtag #VentYourRent, which involved mostly young working professionals expressing their frustrations of having to pay huge fees in return for terrible living conditions.</p><p>In Flatshare, I explore this growing issue through the four leading characters, Omar, Kemi, Tom, and Seb.</p><p>The diversity of the characters in relation to ethnicity, sexuality, class, and political beliefs is very important to me because it reflects my intention of creating an intersectional web series that gives a voice to groups in society who have been underrepresented by mainstream media.</p><h3><strong>Why support us?</strong></h3><p>Creating Flatshare will not be the end of the road for us, it will be the beginning of a campaign to involve the voices of young people most affected by London’s housing crisis and to call for more diversity in front and behind the camera through screenings and panel discussions.</p><p>In addition to highlighting London’s housing crisis, further episodes of Flatshare boldly takes on taboo themes such as Chemsex and social issues such as gentrification and racism, which we believe will resonate and have a big impact on audiences.</p><p>We don’t just want your money, we want you to join our growing community of supporters and help us in whatever way you can.</p><h3><strong>Budget</strong></h3><p>We think that creating a web series about London’s housing crisis is a worthwhile cause, but we need your help raising the money to make it. Just like living in London, shooting in the capital is extremely expensive. Unfortunately there are currently no funding schemes specifically for web series being made in the UK, which is why we need your support.</p><p>As a team we are determined to make the best web series possible, so the more you pledge, the more likely it is that we can achieve this aim.

</ul></div>","The PlotOmar, an artist from Dalston, moves into a rented flatshare in Peckham, South East London bringing along his best friend Kemi, and old flame Tom. But when they meet the estate agent to move into the new flat they are hastily informed that a fourth housemate called Seb will be moving into the loft which has been unexpectedly converted into an extra room. However this is the least of their worries – the flat is falling apart, it’s unfurnished, there’s mould on the wall, mice droppings, and a leaking roof, inevitably creating chaos and conflict between the flatmates.   James BarberWriter and Creator of FlatshareAs someone who was born and bred in London, I have witnessed much of it change to the point of it being completely unrecognisable to me. I grew up between East Dulwich, Brixton and Peckham where my family still live and have watched its transformation from being predominately urban working class areas into thriving cultural hotspots. But this sudden change has resulted in soaring house prices, unaffordable rent, the closing of local businesses, and the displacement of communities.Even though I make a decent living as a writer I struggle to keep up with the rising costs of living in London. Like many people of my generation I’ve spent most of my young adult life renting, not because I wanted to but because it was the only option.I felt inspired to write the series after seeing the hashtag #VentYourRent, which involved mostly young working professionals expressing their frustrations of having to pay huge fees in return for terrible living conditions.In Flatshare, I explore this growing issue through the four leading characters, Omar, Kemi, Tom, and Seb.The diversity of the characters in relation to ethnicity, sexuality, class, and political beliefs is very important to me because it reflects my intention of creating an intersectional web series that gives a voice to groups in society who have been underrepresented by mainstream media.Why support us?Creating Flatshare will not be the end of the road for us, it will be the beginning of a campaign to involve the voices of young people most affected by London’s housing crisis and to call for more diversity in front and behind the camera through screenings and panel discussions.In addition to highlighting London’s housing crisis, further episodes of Flatshare boldly takes on taboo themes such as Chemsex and social issues such as gentrification and racism, which we believe will resonate and have a big impact on audiences.We don’t just want your money, we want you to join our growing community of supporters and help us in whatever way you can.BudgetWe think that creating a web series about London’s housing crisis is a worthwhile cause, but we need your help raising the money to make it. Just like living in London, shooting in the capital is extremely expensive. Unfortunately there are currently no funding schemes specifically for web series being made in the UK, which is why we need your support.As a team we are determined to make the best web series possible, so the more you pledge, the more likely it is that we can achieve this aim. The funds that we raise will go towards:
Hiring locations
Equipment hire
Catering
Transportation
Expenses for cast and crew
Post-production
We are all independent filmmakers so we are reliant on small-scale donations from backers who believe in our vision and what we’re trying to achieve.In total there are six episodes of Flatshare, so if we exceed our funding goal of £2,000 to make two pilot episodes we will attempt to make all six episodes which will enable us to give you a full body of work.To say thank you for your support we have put together some fantastic gifts. If you help us to fund our campaign you can look forward to receiving exclusive perks such as being accredited as one of the executive producers of Flatshare, you can join us on set, or get an exclusive first look at the pilot before it's released as a reward for your contribution. Risks and Challenges Every production has its challenges but we aim to overcome them all!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Jalysa Harris and me and my partner Amber Guidry are the creators and stars of the series ""7 minutes in Heaven"". This story is about 4 sisters(Gia,Lexi,Vanity, &amp; Bambi) dealing with a broken home, maneuvering through everyday life as their secrets and betrayals from an innocent game of 7 minutes in Heaven slowly began to uncover, their sisterhood begins to unravel.</p>
<p>WE all know that we did not choose our family and unlike friends ""cutting them off"" is easier said than done. We all have somebody in our family that makes you look at them in a different light, be it bad or good. That path is something me and Amber knew we needed to talk about. There is a new wave of young talented writers who are creating their own content while telling a story that is not unlike many others. The way you can relate and when you have a script that is so honest is what makes shows like we see today(Insecure, Curious, #Adulting, Atlanta) so fresh and addictive. With your help we would not only be able bring our words and ideas to life but also create the environment needed to make this show a success! Giving this show the aesthetic it needs and the quality in which the audience deserves it. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are only asking for 3000 dollars to make sure 7 minutes in heaven becomes the show that everybody talks about this money will be applied to not just a camera but a better camera, lights, stand, assistance, and the hardest part of any production securing key important locations, permits needed etc.</p>

<p>*Locations will preferably be used through Airbnb. The goal is to allow the viewers to fully invest in the characters and their surroundings so that we keep the authenticity of it.</p>
<p>*We would apply the fund to our appreciation to any vendors, sponsors, producers, editors, crew and cast</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This show is important because right now there is nothing like it, this story is lived a million times in a million lives but never really told. It is something so powerful to know you are not alone, in the world, per experience, thought or what have you. I too have been working as background and a production assistant on so many different projects, films, and movies that I can confidently say I know what it takes to give great quality TV. I've seen how you-tube has changed so many lives and opened up a platform for us all. I think the world loves when a show comes and can be ""game-changer"" and I'm confident that is what 7 minutes in Heaven will be.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I'm aware that this story (which is almost an autobiography of the many difference facets of myself and my partner) can and will receive backlash.

Some may not like the light the characters are put in particularly because they are African-American. I say to that, it doesn't make their life lived any less TRUE and what better way to tell somebody else's story because it is authentic and raw. Every stranger is a person, and they too are living lives separate from our own. I hope it allows the people who may be to scared to say they feel like a walking cliche or statistic(me and my partner struggle with coming to terms with this ourselves) to recognize they too have a voice and they are seen. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506817340/tvrg3d4ixo6e3fnjq2fo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>","""When Fact Met Fiction"" is a present day, sitcom style, web-series that takes place in the fictional southern Appalachian town of Walterville, NC. The setting is the office of Celeste Frank's up-and-coming foodie, lifestyle and feel-good magazine Southern Sunset. In true rom-com fashion, it's about the guy getting the girl, the antics of Walterville natives, plus a few newcomers. All in all, it always comes around to family and friends being there for each other.However, ""When Fact Met Fiction"" is more than a web-series. It's more than great scripts. It's more than great talent delivering their lines. It's a whole world of production where independent filmmakers, cast and crew from Western North Carolina can build their body of work and get paid to do it! Partner with us today in developing both of these amazing stories! Olivia Smith is played by the always happy Rebekah Babelay (sometimes we call her ""the Babe,"" but only when she's not around). ""When Fact Met Fiction"" was Rebekah's first time in front of the camera although she had been doing stage since she was a child. In Season 1 of WFMF, Olivia Smith has just started as Southern Sunset's new editor. This is Olivia's first real job since graduating college and she's determined to help take Southern Sunset's articles to the next level, but then Jon shows up...  Jon Frank is played by the exuberant Jeff Ryan Alexander, always a character on and off the set. Stefan Liner (Director of WFMF) and Jeff met back in 2014 when Stefan cast him in a music video. Stefan has been a fan of Jeff's ever since, and when casting time came for Season 1 of WFMF, Stefan was delighted to be able to give the role of Jon to Jeff. In Season 1, we learn that Jon Frank is secretly the successful romance writer, Nathaniel Embers. He is just back from meeting with his publicist when his sister in-law, Celeste Frank, calls in a favor. Upon dropping by Southern Sunset to meet with Celeste, he notices Olivia. Considering Celeste's predicament, he decides that writing for his sister-in-law's lifestyle magazine might be a good change of pace, especially if he gets the vacant desk across from the new editor. Celeste Frank is played by the award-winning Carol Anderson who is both a joy and an absolute professional on set. Carol, and her husband Jim Shores, are the founders and directors of Acts of Renewal, a live act that performs all over the world. When she's not performing with her husband, she's teaching at Asbury University in Wilmore, Kentucky. Carol is originally from Boston, MA, but in WFMF she puts on a high-society, Georgia-style southern accent.  Celeste is Jon's sister-in-law, a single mother to Sunny Frank, and the owner of Southern Sunset magazine. She juggles all that and is also the encourager-in-chief to those around her along the way. Mel Tenant is played by the master of improv, Mondy Carter. Mondy always has a quip ready to go. Many times during the filming of Season 1, Stefan would have Mondy freestyle a scene just to see what he would come up with. Mel Tenant is a longtime friend of the Franks, and is in charge of layout design and photography for Southern Sunset magazine. Many think Celeste just hired him out of pity, because his photos really aren't that great.  Sunny Frank is played by the multi-talented Madison Garris. Not only is Madison an awesome actor, singer and cos player, she's also one of the sweetest, most enthusiastic people you'll ever meet! Sunny Frank is Celeste's 16-year-old daughter who often helps out around the office at Southern Sunset. In Season 1, she unwittingly spills the beans to Olivia about Jon's troubled love life and starts a romance of her own with the neighborhood pizza delivery guy Owen Phelps, but more on that in Season 2. =) Vic Freeman is played by the very smooth king of attitude Drez Ryan. Drez is actually one of the nicest, most agreeable guys you'll meet, but he sure can play an awesome jerk. That's why whe're bringing him back for Season 2 to be part of the core cast... and because we just like having him on set. In Season 1, Vic left Southern Sunset in Episode 1 for greener pastures. Things didn't quite work out, so he's come back to Southern Sunset and Celeste has decided to give him a second chance. This year our goal is to raise $120,000 to produce Season 2 of ""When Fact Met Fiction."" The main thing that amount does for us is gives us more time in production. Last year, we shot Season 1 (105 pages) in just over 54 hours. It truly was amazing that we were able to pull that off, but it wasn't ideal. $120,000 will allow us to shoot for 16 days, and give us 4 days of rehearsals. Also, last year Stefan Liner (the Director) edited the show and he's not even an editor. $120,000 will allow us a line-item to hire an editor  that can really take the show to the next level! Below, is a simple chart showing how the $120,000 will be used.CLICK HERE to view the Budget Top SheetThe creators of ""When Fact Met Fiction"" are mother and son team, Stefan Liner and Robin Liner.

<p>My name is Darryl Vickers and I am one of the creators of Private Investigations.</p>
<p>Private Investigations was a world I created based on my experiences growing up in my diverse neighborhood in San Diego during the 60's and 70's. Things were much different back then. People knew each other and families weren't limited to blood relatives. There was a sense of community and good will towards everyone no matter what their gender, race, skin color or ability.</p>
<p>Hollywood these days shows only a glimpse of what the real world is like; favoring the over-dramatic and super violent over the thought provoking and heart warming stories. Some of the characters are too far from reality and not anything we can relate to.</p>
<p>Private investigations is a show of a different breed. It concentrates on those human connections. It celebrates all our differences yet shows how including all of these different traits makes us a very powerful community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sam is an old detective who is very good at solving mysteries but sometimes requires a little help from his granddaughter Megan and her friends. He also enlists the help of the local police from Detective Holly Chambers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489762349/tefhbzsiicu4u3vwytar.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hollywood sometimes... or perhaps often... spits out high budget, generic stories. Often they are remakes and fresh ideas get shunned every day. We often leave the theater or watch television these days wanting something more satisfying... We want  more human experience that we can relate to... For more characters like us.</p>
<p>Also the audience has changed to global. Diverse audiences including different cultures, races, economic backgrounds and abilities are waiting. Private Investigations was written as a global series; taking into account all these factors to put out a great story that truly expresses the world we live in.<br/><br/>Independent film and television doesn't answer to the lowest common denominator, or the highest funding dangled in front of us. It supports diversity in style and story; innovation in filmmaking and storytelling; and unique visions and voices in cinema. In a word something NEW! With Independents there is a place for any filmmaker willing to look at ourselves, ask the hard questions, fan the flames of curiosity, and still consider humanity with empathy and compassion. We can relate to the stories of those who never had a chance to tell them and breathe life back into our film and television shows.</p>

<p>THE DILEMMA</p>
<p>Repercussions are the unforeseen effects of our actions. The series begins with Millicent and Reina, long-time besties, who are confronted by people from their past. These ladies quickly realize that they are about to suffer the repercussions of their past actions. Is it possible to stand strong when our decisions are being held over our heads? How do we break free?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE VISION</p>
<p>Creating female characters that are powerful in their own right is what this show is about. These ladies make their own decisions, are complex and unapologetically flawed. Their choices will infuriate you, make you laugh and even make you think.  Although their selections may not be your own, they are true to whom they are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE TEAM</p>
<p>Repercussions the Show is committed to inclusion of gender and ethnicity as it focuses on destroying stereotypes in front of and behind the camera. With a majority female cast as well as a female writer, executive producer, director, cinematographer, producers and editor, the feminine influence will be apparent in this show. In addition to strong storytelling, we are providing an opportunity to showcase local talent and businesses in this niche area. We aim to prove that great stories don't have to come from Hollywood--an interesting, raw and homegrown episodic series can be developed right here in Charlotte, NC.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE LEADER</p>
<p>Executive Producer/Writer/Director Keema Mingo, is an African-American woman who is using her 20 years of TV and video production experience as a springboard to bring to life her first original series.  Coming from a multiracial, multicultural background, Keema has developed a series which reflects that inclusive mindset and heritage she possess. Her goal is to create imperfect yet relatable characters in a series that is both entertaining and addictive. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE FUTURE</p>
<p>Our hope is to exceed our financial goals so we can produce a top-notch, high-quality pilot episode. To continue the excitement around the show, we will do several private viewings of the pilot before its mid-March online release. Once the pilot is complete, we will use it to promote fundraising efforts for the rest of season one (episodes 2-8).  Our goal is to create such a frenzy around this series that VOD companies (video on demand), network and/or cable outlets seek to partner with us for seasons two and beyond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE VIEWER</p>
<p>We thank you in advance for supporting our homegrown campaign. We offer rewards to bring you closer to the heart of this journey when you donate! Feel free to share our message in your social media outlets to let them know you support our goal in providing a stereotype-breaking, inclusive, captivating, locally-made series.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is PJ Leonard and I am the creator of ""DPW"". ""DPW"" came to me after admiring certain characters that crossed my path in life. We sometimes forget that life isn't all about materialistic needs but just the ability to get to the next day. Coming from a blue collar upbringing then crossing over to the white collar world I was always amazed how we forget that it is the blue collar work force that allows others to live there lives on a regular basis. Sometimes we need to acknowledge the people that truly make the world go around. That would be our friends at the  ""DPW"" in our Township of Rasberry.</p>
<p>       We are asking to help us cross the finish line. We need to raise $7000 for post-production. Post production is where the magic truly happens. We know with our talented cast and our team behind the camera and the individuals working on the post production we will deliver an award winning project. You will become part of an experience many never thought could be possible.</p>
<p>       Producing isn't easy but it truly is rewarding when your vision projects on the screen. </p>
<p>       Sharing and making others aware of our project will be a great help also.</p>
<p>      So if you can help in any way possible please do,</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<h3>What Will the Old School Coach TV Show be About?</h3>
<p>The Old School Coach unscripted TV show is an extension of what Coach does in his one-on-one training sessions. We follow the lives of several families, couples, or individuals, over the course of a season, as Coach uses every tool and trick in his book to bring these broken bodies and lives into restoration. We watch Coach: Train, Inspire, Cajole, Provoke, Tease, Taunt, whatever it takes to change their lives and health for the better.</p>
<p>The first show begins by introducing us to our season participants. We hear them tell their stories of severe health issues or how they got into shape they are currently in. We see pictures of “better days gone by”, or of a whole life of bad health choices. Each one tells us how they want to change, but why they can’t.</p>
<p>As the season progresses we follow the successes and failures of each participant. We watch Coach brings his special sense of humor and tough love to reshape their lives, health, and bodies. He trains each one differently to match their personality, but from his core philosophy: ""Train Your Mind, Change Your Body!""</p>
<p>Of course, the segments of Coach working with his clients will be interspersed with his fun, entertaining, and off-kilter life.</p>

<h3>How Can Old School Coach Help the World?</h3>
<p>The health of America is undergoing an alarming decline. For the first time: since the 1960s the average American lifespan has decreased 2 years in a row. Type 2 diabetes is at epidemic proportion and costs America $671 million <i>per</i> <i>day</i>. The fraction of the disease death rate from preventable diseases is estimated to be close to 40%. 70% of Americans are overweight and 1 in 3 are classified as obese.</p>
<p>In this era with an enormous amount of easily accessible health and fitness information and knowledge, why is the health of America in such a horrible state? It’s because the current health and fitness industry is shortsighted and focused on selling “get fit quick” products and ideas; it does not focus on permanently changing people’s behavior. This neglected concept is <i>exactly</i> the focus of Old School Coach. He strives to guide people to recognize their own faulty belief systems and replace them with healthy ones, thus changing their behavior now and for the future.</p>
<p>He has lived a lifetime of health and fitness and is proof that YOU can do it too! NO EXCUSES!</p> <h3><strong>The extraordinarily talented and experienced team who have faulty belief systems and think Old School Coach should be on TV.</strong></h3>

<h3>About the Project:</h3>
<p><i>Play The Fool</i> is a comedic web series about a young actor, Manuel, who buries a stupid grudge with his ex-best friend and low-key social media celebrity, Raul, to get access to his followers and get on the fast track to fame himself. In the process, Manuel is unknowingly thrust into a love triangle with the two people he thought he could trust most. *wipes away tears* We've all been there, right? </p>
<p>The clip above is a concept trailer to hopefully give you an idea of our vibe, an intro to the characters, and their stories for the show. With your contributions, you'll help bring the real deal to life when we shoot the two-part pilot of this web series in December 2017. </p>
<p>This has been an absolute passion project for the last year, and I feel like it's finally ready to share with all of you lovely people. It's an absolute dream come true to have so many amazing people involved to help me bring this story to life.</p>

<p><strong>Daniel Martinez - Creator, Writer, Executive Producer, STAH! (Manuel)</strong></p>
<p>Daniel started in the industry as an actor living in San Francisco. With a BA from the University of San Francisco, he appeared in commercials for Hipchat, Skyy Vodka, and Yik Yak. As Daniel tried to break into short films and bigger roles, it became clear that he would be categorized and placed into stereotypes based on his brown skin and chubbier build. And as a 5th generation American, Daniel always felt like he was ""too Mexican"" to be American, and ""too American"" to be Mexican. This inspired him to take his career into his own hands and learn how to write and produce his own stories so that he could help diversify the representation of minorities in TV and Film. He firmly believes that we're more than our cultures, and it's okay to be a multi-faceted, multi-layered character who happens to have brown skin, and have no connection to your ethnicity if that's not your experience. Daniel also bases a lot of his stories off his own life, and really loves finding the comedy in everything, no matter how tragic. Now in his third year as a Writing and Producing for Television grad student at LMU, Daniel is ready to tackle the ""real world"" while bringing his unique shade of brown, and voice to the party. <u>Daniel's a fool for hot men, cookies and cream milkshakes, and charcuterie plates. </u></p>

As a director, Brenna prides herself on her attention to subtle storytelling detail, her focus on performance and passion for bringing female characters with depth to the big screen. She endeavors to tell stories close to the heart, while at the same time aiming to reach a wide audience with each film. Her thesis film, <i>Rocket</i>, has won a Student Academy Award, an Individual Merit Award for Best Director at the Richmond International Film Festival, awards in China, the UK, and has screened in over forty festivals in eight countries. <u>Brenna's a fool for gin martinis...with a twist! </u></p>

The clip above is a concept trailer to hopefully give you an idea of our vibe, an intro to the characters, and their stories for the show. With your contributions, you'll help bring the real deal to life when we shoot the two-part pilot of this web series in December 2017. 
This has been an absolute passion project for the last year, and I feel like it's finally ready to share with all of you lovely people. It's an absolute dream come true to have so many amazing people involved to help me bring this story to life.
A little more info about us:
 
Daniel Martinez - Creator, Writer, Executive Producer, STAH! (Manuel)
Daniel started in the industry as an actor living in San Francisco. With a BA from the University of San Francisco, he appeared in commercials for Hipchat, Skyy Vodka, and Yik Yak. As Daniel tried to break into short films and bigger roles, it became clear that he would be categorized and placed into stereotypes based on his brown skin and chubbier build. And as a 5th generation American, Daniel always felt like he was ""too Mexican"" to be American, and ""too American"" to be Mexican. This inspired him to take his career into his own hands and learn how to write and produce his own stories so that he could help diversify the representation of minorities in TV and Film. He firmly believes that we're more than our cultures, and it's okay to be a multi-faceted, multi-layered character who happens to have brown skin, and have no connection to your ethnicity if that's not your experience. Daniel also bases a lot of his stories off his own life, and really loves finding the comedy in everything, no matter how tragic. Now in his third year as a Writing and Producing for Television grad student at LMU, Daniel is ready to tackle the ""real world"" while bringing his unique shade of brown, and voice to the party. Daniel's a fool for hot men, cookies and cream milkshakes, and charcuterie plates. 
 
 
Brenna Malloy - Director
Brenna Malloy graduated from the University of San Francisco after earning a BA in Media Studies with a minor in theater. She cultivated her passion of storytelling through performance for two terms at The Drama Centre London. In London she trained under acclaimed Scottish theater director Lorne Campbell. At Chapman University, Brenna continued her education by earning an MFA in Film Production with an emphasis in Directing. She was closely mentored by directors David Ward, Martha Coolidge, and Nick Meyer. Brenna continued to work as an independent filmmaker, directing shorts, both before and during her time in her master's film program. As a director, Brenna prides herself on her attention to subtle storytelling detail, her focus on performance and passion for bringing female characters with depth to the big screen. She endeavors to tell stories close to the heart, while at the same time aiming to reach a wide audience with each film. Her thesis film, Rocket, has won a Student Academy Award, an Individual Merit Award for Best Director at the Richmond International Film Festival, awards in China, the UK, and has screened in over forty festivals in eight countries. Brenna's a fool for gin martinis...with a twist! 
 

Justin Alpern - Cinematographer and Producer
Justin Alpern was born in California and has lived and worked all over the west coast. He has been capturing the world on film ever since his Dad loaned him his first camera - a Contax RTS with Zeiss lenses - when he was 12 years old. He graduated from Linfield College with a degree in studio art and art history. After graduation, he created a fine art gallery in Portland and continued to work as a photographer and videographer. In Portland, he found his way onto a film set and hasn't looked back since. His passion for the craft and the desire to teach brought him to Chapman University where he earned an MFA in Cinematography. After graduation Justin started MEE LLC, a production company focused on corporate and commercial work. Currently, Justin lives in Culver City and works wherever the project takes him. Justin's a fool for gluten free baked goods! 

Eric Tate - Producer
Eric Tate is a fantasy-comedy writer and a third year Writing and Producing for Television graduate student at LMU. He lives to write, and works to live. He often finds himself in absurd situations that no one ever believes. But they happened, dammit! Eric's a fool for traveling, dogs, and Happy Hour deals.
 

Marion Arrou-Vignod - Script Supervisor
Marion hailed all the way from Antibes, France, almost six years ago. A second-year Writing and Producing for Television graduate student at LMU, she has worked as a script supervisor on several thesis films while working to build her own portfolio. An avid reader all her life, Marion first got into writing when she became hooked on shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Marion's a fool for television shows, cheeseburgers, and being swarmed by puppies. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
In total, we are asking for $5,000 to help make this project the best that it can be. The majority of our budget will go towards ensuring we have the best possible team in all phases of production to help make sure the project looks and sounds as professional as possible. The rest of the money we raise will go towards production design for our sets, food for our cast and crew, stipends for our actors, location permits, and other general expenses that occur when shooting a project. 
We know this is a lot to ask, but no donation is too small! Really. Whether it be $1, or $1,000,000, we are immensely thankful to each of you for taking the time to support our project. To help entice you, we are more than willing to give you more bang for your buck with our fabulous perks! Particularly, you can make Daniel Martinez make a fool of himself any way you see fit for just $10. Go on! Have fun with it! 
Other perks include a personalized video from the cast, behind the scenes videos and photos, a chance to be IN the project, and a chance to visit the actual set! Check them out! 

The Impact
Your contribution will be profoundly beneficial and appreciated. There's a myriad of independent web series and films out there in the world, and it's easy to be drowned out by them. I firmly believe that my perspective as a storyteller is a unique one, and one that deserves a chance in the spotlight. Your contribution can help us get there and establish ourselves to continue to bring you unique, funny, tragic, and messy stories with compelling characters of color. I thank you in advance for your generosity, and for believing in us. We may be fools, but we'll hopefully make you proud! 
-Daniel Martinez

<h3>THE SHOW</h3>
<p>Raise The Bar is a fresh and new show about the art of cocktail making.</p>
<p>There is nothing like this out there and we want to change that. Unlike other shows, we will not be baking cakes or cooking fancy dishes. Just making drinks, tasty ones at that. This show will have a cool and professional vibe as we focus on the skill and creativity needed to be the best behind the bar!</p>
<p>Renaissance Vodka are pleased to support and sponsor the project. Alongside providing our vodka, Renaissance mixologist Antonio Del Monte will proffer consultancy for the show.</p>
<p>We're a small group of Film Production students, hoping to get this show off it's feet and out there for you to see!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>SO WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE ASKING FOR?</h3>
<p>As you've seen in the video, we've secured a high quality Tv Studio to film in with 4K cameras and crew. We're also collaborating with interior designers to create a set for the show. We need your donation to help pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Materials for the set</li>
<li>Cast - some top notch bartenders </li>
<li>Presenter- someone who can keep the spirits up and conversation flowing from contestants</li>
<li>Travel- trains, planes,automobiles for cast and crew</li>
<li>Catering- food, glorious food</li>
<li>Props- Cocktail equipment isn't cheap. We need glasses, shakers, measures, everything needed to make a decent drink</li>
<li>Ingredients- mixers, spirits, garnishes. We have 2 contestants and 3 challenges, each one will need a table full of ingredients and don't forget rehearsals</li>
</ul>
<p>But it's not like you won't get anything in return. Have a browse through the rewards, from badges to shot glasses. As a thank you for the donation we want to give you something for your generosity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT YOUR HELP CAN DO</h3>
<p>Cocktail making is moving into the mainstream. People are becoming more interested in mixology than ever before and we want to be a part of the movement. There isn't anything like this out there and we want to be the first. By donating, you're helping us get that one step closer to making a high quality show that can possibly become something huge.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>CHALLENGES WE FACE</h3>
<p>As it's a Tv Studio, we will be editing live through a vision mixer. This means that on the day it has to be perfect without any hiccups. The show itself will be 30 minutes in the studio. In post we will trim it down to be 15 with VT inserts and transitions to keep it interesting. All the crew are highly trained in the studio. To make sure we'll be in best shape on the day, we'll be rehearsing regularly, filming practices and mini challenges. Each rehearsal will be posted on our social media so you can see how we're getting on with things.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY BUT STILL WANT TO HELP?</h3>
<p>We've got pages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. If you can't donate a simple share of the pages and post will help us reach more people and share our idea. Look out for regular videos and photography by our team to give an idea of what we're doing and the shows style.</p>

<h3>What The F*** Is This?</h3>
<p>It all started one day in 2012... </p>
<p>Lucy and Jeremy got in line for an audition...and a representative of the actor's union threatened to call the cops and have them arrested for loitering. A few hours later, at yet another audition, Lucy started to perform her monologue...and was interrupted by a small dog harassing her leg as Jeremy watched in horror. It was only noon.

<p><i>Way The F*** Off Broadway</i> is the brainchild of best friends Lucy Zukaitis and Jeremy Sonkin.

<p><strong>History of Resonando</strong></p>
<p>After the new sunrise of the 13 Baktun (the beginning of the new era according to the Mayan cosmology), we felt the necessity of sharing what we felt passionate about and share it with other people. So my luthier brother (Chelelongius) proposed me (Carolingius) to conduct investigations, into the most unique musical instruments in the world and share it for free with all the people we feel connected to and that have the same passion for musical instruments. . This, to further understand their origin, cultural importance and specifically the unique process of their creation. But, which instruments qualifies to be part of such investigational project? Stringed, percussion, wind…</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1 - The Udu Drum, sounds from the hearth of the earth</strong></p>
<p>In the Mayan Book, The Popol Vuh, the gods Kucumatz and Huracan, chose to create the first humans from mud… therefore we found it interesting to research such a basic instrument that can be made out of just mud - a pottery musical instrument, a ceramic drum, “The Udu”.</p>

• Develop all the pre production, and research.
• Travel to India for the production.
• Send all the Rewards.
• Create and record, The traveler Sitar.
• Editing, post production.
Therefore we are asking for your help to make this mission & vision happen.

This chapter will begin with a ceremony, in the heart of the ancient India - In the temple of the Goddess Saraswati during a sunrise, asking for her blessings, and feeling a special appreciation for giving the Sitar to humanity, the music, the art, the knowledge & the wisdom.
We intent to include blessings for the people that helped us accomplish this part of the research in the ceremony.
 
As part of our investigation, my luthier brother Chelelongius will be building a Traveler model of a Guitar Sitar, following the same resonance principles of the sympathetic strings

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Greg Wicker. Since 1999 I've been producing and hosting Hollywood-style game show entertainment for fandom conventions across North America. I launched a Youtube channel ten years ago, featuring footage from hundreds of game shows that I've produced over the years.<br/><br/>After the most recent issues with Patreon, I've decided to forego using them as a fundraising platform and have instead chosen Indiegogo to continue to keep the Youtube channel going and growing. Utilizing this campaign, I'll be able to continue giving regular editing jobs to the people who've upped the quality of my game show videos!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the level of two videos per month (which the last months of Patreon were able to maintain), I am asking for a minimum of $100 per video for six videos, two for September, October and November.  </p>
<p>As the campaign crosses each $100 threshold, I will send payment and raw footage to one of my three editors. As soon as the video is completed and quality-checked, it will be uploaded to my Youtube channel.</p>
<p>If the campaign exceeds the goal, for every $100 increment in excess of the $600 goal, I will send footage and payment to an editor for a bonus video.</p>
<p>If we fail to cross the $100 threshold for the first video, I will attempt this campaign again in November for video uploads in winter.</p>
<p>There are incentives to contributing beyond helping get more Greggo's Game Shows on Youtube! First, for any contribution you get your name in the credits of the video you're funding.</p>
<p>If you contribute at least $15 (and are in the United States), you can choose any one of the buttons I've created that I sell at conventions. Either I can mail one to you or I can bring one to a convention you happen to be attending where I'm performing:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534366689/jxr6sytah6ts0iavbry4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A contribution of $25 or more will get you a button (if you're in the US) and will get you guaranteed ""frontest-row"" seating at any game show at any convention where I'm performing. In other words, you can sit as far front as the convention will allow (some have reserved VIP seating) and can beat the lines so long as I know you're coming!</p>
<p>A contribution of $100 or more will give you the opportunity to choose any video you want, and provided we filmed it and its contents aren't duplicate of another convention's playing of that same show, I'll immediately send its footage and a payment to an editor, and it will get made and uploaded! You'll also get a button if you're in the US and ""frontest-row"" seating as before.</p>
<p>Finally, a contribution of $150 gets you all the aforementioned perks, all six buttons if you're in the US, and you can choose one of the pieces of software I use in my games, and I'll send it to you to host your own game shows at home! (If you'd like to use my software for other reasons you'll need to contact me outside this campaign.)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a pretty straightforward campaign. Each $100 pays for a video. My editors have done a great job at turning out their videos by the deadlines I've asked for. Should this campaign fail to attract enough interest, I will still be able to edit my own videos from time to time; they will just take a while and the schedule will be quite erratic in order to maintain the quality you're used to seeing from me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're unable to contribute via Indiegogo, you can still contribute in other ways! Share this campaign with folks who you think can help. If you see that I'm coming to a convention near you, make sure to hype your friends and get them excited to see my games! And if you staff for a convention that could use my brand of programming, make sure to let them know about me!</p>
<p>And to all of you, thank you so much for your support over these past twenty years.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>[L to R: Regina Renée Russell (Rebecca Jackson); Anna Stacy (Harper Young); Daniel Cabrera (Leo Solano); Joe Raik (Mac); Leslie Field (Eleanor Evans); Nicole Martinez (Maisie Perez); and Laurel Andersen (Jodie Bates)]</i></p>
<p><i><a href=""https://dead-enders.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dead-Enders</a> </i>is a comedy web series that follows a forum of doomsday preppers on their weekly video calls at the start of the zombie apocalypse. The show's pilot season was written and produced by longtime friends and collaborators Nicole Martinez and Anna Stacy in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the creative team has since grown in preparation for season 2.</p>
</div>
<p>When conceptualizing <i>Dead-Enders</i>, Nicole and Anna (hello!) sought to create a series that loosely paralleled the global pandemic and its accompanying isolation while still capturing the cozy feeling of an ensemble sitcom. The first episode takes place one week into the zombie apocalypse and over the course of season 1, the audience sees the preppers develop closer friendships as they adapt to a quickly-changing world.</p>
<p>Our small but mighty cast and crew sees so much promise in the series, which is why we’re asking for your support during our fundraising campaign. We are endeavoring to raise $20,000 in order to create a collaborative, fulfilling, and COVID-safe environment in which to film a high-quality eight-episode second season. With your donation, we can continue creating art and providing work for indie filmmakers in a time when the role of the arts is more important than ever. </p>

<p><br/>Season 1 was created with nothing more than a passionate, enthusiastic team of actors and a premium Zoom account — which is to say, with $0.  As the plot for season 2 is more ambitious and involved, our budget is expanding accordingly.</p>
<p>The majority of our raised funds will be allocated to the following areas: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Expanded team</i><ul><li>Paying our incredible (and considerably larger) team is our top priority. Each member of the cast and crew will be paid the same stipend, and any surplus funds raised will be allocated equally to the team itself</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>Equipment &amp; Props</i><ul>
<li>Equipment &amp; tech: renting video, lighting, and audio equipment will rack up some of our highest costs</li>
<li>Buying &amp; creating props: with zombie content comes the zombie aesthetic! Since it turns out we're unable to hire actual undead actors, we're gonna need to use all kinds of makeup and prosthetics to create the preppers' world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>Food &amp; Transportation</i><ul>
<li>Craft Services: we want to ensure our team is well-nourished and caffeinated throughout the entire process</li>
<li>Location scouting/transportation: We'll be using funds to scout for filming locations and book/reserve any spaces needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>COVID precautions</i><ul><li>
<i>​</i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">It is essential to us that our set adheres to the most current COVID regulations, and providing testing as well as additional PPE and disinfectant materials for members of our team adds to our overall expenses</span>

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We (Anna and Nicole) have been collaborating for six years, and our artistic relationship has only strengthened our friendship.

<p>During the release of its first season, <i>Dead-Enders</i> was praised by multiple media outlets: the series was reviewed by media site Geek Insider’s online publication and discussed on its podcast; The Nerdy Girl Express wrote, “What Martinez and Stacy have created is fun to watch and it will have you laughing and enjoying yourself…[the preppers] will feel like friends you have happened to come upon on the internet.” Across the domestic and international film festival field,<i> Dead-Enders </i>has taken home the gold in multiple Best Web Series/Television categories (Royal Wolf Film Awards, White Unicorn Int. Film Fest) and has been featured as an official selection in many others.<br/> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>[Dead-Enders director Dani Hanks (left) on the set of ""Pretty, Ugly, Complicated""]</i></p>
<p><i>Dead-Enders</i> was created in the wake of theaters canceling performances and filmmakers halting productions. A year since the virus first came to the US, more and more artists have taken to the digital world to create if they’ve not lost the drive to do so. We are deeply honored to be able to create a space for our fellow creators to practice their art. </p>
<p>Additionally, as artists of color ourselves, inclusion and diversity have always been at the heart of <i>Dead-Enders</i>, on both sides of the camera. Women of color and LGBTQ+ folks are rarely the leads in genre fiction if they're in them at all, and we aim to disrupt that paradigm in everything we create. <i>Dead-Enders</i> is an opportunity to create something rooted in genuine collaboration and community. With this in mind, we’re delighted to introduce our expanded production team of award-winning indie filmmakers and a not-insignificant number of NYU alums (bonus points if you can spot them all). All of us are so excited to bring our talents together to create the series. </p>

[L to R: Regina Renée Russell (Rebecca Jackson); Anna Stacy (Harper Young); Daniel Cabrera (Leo Solano); Joe Raik (Mac); Leslie Field (Eleanor Evans); Nicole Martinez (Maisie Perez); and Laurel Andersen (Jodie Bates)]
Dead-Enders is a comedy web series that follows a forum of doomsday preppers on their weekly video calls at the start of the zombie apocalypse. The show's pilot season was written and produced by longtime friends and collaborators Nicole Martinez and Anna Stacy in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the creative team has since grown in preparation for season 2.

When conceptualizing Dead-Enders, Nicole and Anna (hello!) sought to create a series that loosely paralleled the global pandemic and its accompanying isolation while still capturing the cozy feeling of an ensemble sitcom. The first episode takes place one week into the zombie apocalypse and over the course of season 1, the audience sees the preppers develop closer friendships as they adapt to a quickly-changing world.
Our small but mighty cast and crew sees so much promise in the series, which is why we’re asking for your support during our fundraising campaign. We are endeavoring to raise $20,000 in order to create a collaborative, fulfilling, and COVID-safe environment in which to film a high-quality eight-episode second season. With your donation, we can continue creating art and providing work for indie filmmakers in a time when the role of the arts is more important than ever. 
 
What We Need & What You'll Get

Season 1 was created with nothing more than a passionate, enthusiastic team of actors and a premium Zoom account — which is to say, with $0.  As the plot for season 2 is more ambitious and involved, our budget is expanding accordingly.
The majority of our raised funds will be allocated to the following areas: 


Expanded teamPaying our incredible (and considerably larger) team is our top priority. Each member of the cast and crew will be paid the same stipend, and any surplus funds raised will be allocated equally to the team itself


Equipment & Props
Equipment & tech: renting video, lighting, and audio equipment will rack up some of our highest costs
Buying & creating props: with zombie content comes the zombie aesthetic! Since it turns out we're unable to hire actual undead actors, we're gonna need to use all kinds of makeup and prosthetics to create the preppers' world



Food & Transportation
Craft Services: we want to ensure our team is well-nourished and caffeinated throughout the entire process
Location scouting/transportation: We'll be using funds to scout for filming locations and book/reserve any spaces needed



COVID precautions
​It is essential to us that our set adheres to the most current COVID regulations, and providing testing as well as additional PPE and disinfectant materials for members of our team adds to our overall expenses




 
About the Team

[Top to bottom, L to R: Mark DePasquale (Director); Avani Galande (Editor); Gracie Giffune (Director/Gaffer); Dani Hanks (Director); Nicole Martinez (Writer); Becca Musser (Fight Choreographer); Christina “Cha” Ramos (Intimacy Director); Kristin Sgarro (Production Manager); Anna Stacy (Writer); Charles Stacy (Composer & Audio Engineer); Reed Yurman (Director); Ellie Zarr (Editor)]
We (Anna and Nicole) have been collaborating for six years, and our artistic relationship has only strengthened our friendship. After graduating college, our first collaboration was a full-length play entitled And What Grew There, which opened in December 2019 with the help of a minimal budget. That was over a year and a whole virus outbreak ago—since then, the considerably more ambitious first season of Dead-Enders was brought to life with an even scarcer budget
During the release of its first season, Dead-Enders was praised by multiple media outlets: the series was reviewed by media site Geek Insider’s online publication and discussed on its podcast; The Nerdy Girl Express wrote, “What Martinez and Stacy have created is fun to watch and it will have you laughing and enjoying yourself…[the preppers] will feel like friends you have happened to come upon on the internet.” Across the domestic and international film festival field, Dead-Enders has taken home the gold in multiple Best Web Series/Television categories (Royal Wolf Film Awards, White Unicorn Int. Film Fest) and has been featured as an official selection in many others.

Dead-Enders was created in the wake of theaters canceling performances and filmmakers halting productions. A year since the virus first came to the US, more and more artists have taken to the digital world to create if they’ve not lost the drive to do so. We are deeply honored to be able to create a space for our fellow creators to practice their art. 
Additionally, as artists of color ourselves, inclusion and diversity have always been at the heart of Dead-Enders, on both sides of the camera. Women of color and LGBTQ+ folks are rarely the leads in genre fiction if they're in them at all, and we aim to disrupt that paradigm in everything we create. Dead-Enders is an opportunity to create something rooted in genuine collaboration and community. With this in mind, we’re delighted to introduce our expanded production team of award-winning indie filmmakers and a not-insignificant number of NYU alums (bonus points if you can spot them all). All of us are so excited to bring our talents together to create the series. 
 
Potential Challenges

[Dead-Enders director Mark DePasquale (right) with his digitally rendered ""Coronabot""]
With our shooting schedule tentatively planned for summer 2021, one of our main challenges will be dependent on the vaccine rollout. Along with allocating part of the budget to proper PPE and sanitation procedures for the set, production meetings and initial rehearsals will be held over Zoom. 
We also understand that it can be difficult or even impossible to put aside a day job or use vacation time to film an indie web series. We will be filming on weekends in an effort to not take anyone away from their work. 
Other challenges we definitely face include the possibility of scaling back certain aspects of the season if we can’t reach our goal. Everything else aside, we mainly care about these characters and the emotional journeys they’ve set out on. But we prefer to not have to skimp on the zombie guts.

<h2>Who we are &amp; What we're gonna do</h2>
<p>We're apartment G26-2, six hardworking and driven Ithaca College students who are ready to get back to working and being creative after nine long months away. We can't wait to finally be back on set, but we're not willing to sacrifice safety to get there.</p>
<p>So how do we make a show while in lockdown? By stretching the limits of what our six-person apartment can accomplish and transforming ourselves into an incredibly hard-working skeleton crew for a brand-new comedy series! Everyone's pulling double, triple, even quadruple duty! Not opening our set up to anyone from outside the apartment will certainly be a challenge, but it's one we're more than up to!</p>
<p>Designed around these restrictions, and created by Joel Liss and Joshua Stein, <i>Wormhole</i> is an irreverent, <i>Twilight-Zone-</i>inspired, take on the Covid lockdown experience.</p>
<p><i>Quarantined in an apartment that happens to be the center of the universe, best friends Joel and Josh (played, naturally, by Joel and Josh) find themselves in increasingly confounding scenarios that break the laws of the natural world and threaten their friendship.</i></p>
<p>Our goal is to produce six short-form episodes over the course of our spring semester to be distributed over various digital platforms including Youtube, Facebook, and Instagram TV. We have the cast, we have the crew, and we've got the scripts. Now all we need is a little support from you to get this show up and running!</p>
<p><i>To see some of our prior work, check out our page's video gallery!</i></p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We're looking to raise $2000 over Indiegogo for our six-episode first season. After taxes and fees, this will give us a budget of approximately $300 an episode.  How will we spend that money to ensure it all translates into quality onscreen?​​​</p>
<h3>What we will be spending money on:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The majority of each episode's budget will be spent on props and other production design considerations. The pilot, for example, sees Joel throw a sugar glass vase at Josh. </li>
<li>Some money will go to ensure the cast and crew (us) receive hot meals while shooting, and assistant editors get food covered during post-production. These 14-hour days aren't going to power themselves.</li>
<li>The rest will be set aside for incidentals, on a per-case basis at our discretion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What we will NOT be spending money on:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paying ourselves a salary of any kind.</li>
<li>Pricey licensing fees for content made by a third party, such as music or FX packages.</li>
<li>New Camera/Lighting/Sound gear.</li>
<li>A presidential pardon for Gilbert, the extraterrestrial sock puppet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What YOU get:</h3>
<p>We know we're no one special, just a couple of kids trying to make something cool, so we're not going to waste anyone's time offering ""meet and greets with the cast and crew"" or ""signed copies of such-and-such."" What we are offering as our perks are various ways that we can say ""thank you for supporting our student project"" in a way that we think will make everyone feel warm and cozy.  Your support really will mean the world to us, and we hope these various perks will provide a fun way for us to show you that.</p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h2>The Risks</h2>
<h3>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</h3>
<p>We're still student creators, and the honest truth is that we could do this show for less. But it'll look a heck of a lot better with a little bit of spending behind it. At $300 an episode, we're still firmly in the scrappy microbudget territory of filmmaking, but even that will give us a huge boost toward accomplishing this challenge we've set for ourselves. But rest assured, no matter how much money we raise, this show is getting made.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What happens if Ithaca transitions to online learning?</h3>
<p>Because the show will be shot in an on-campus apartment, its production is at least semi-contingent on the college maintaining its plan for on-campus living in the spring. Though we feel it's unlikely, were Ithaca College to announce a transition to a fully online spring semester, we have a couple of different contingency plans in place.</p>
<p>If the college announces the transitions before the return to campus:</p>
<ol>
<li>The members of apartment G26-2 will likely be searching for different living accommodations in Ithaca during the semester, and the show would be produced there instead.</li>
<li>We may also apply for an exception allowing us to move in to the apartment anyway.</li>
<li>Barring that, if we haven't started rolling, we'll likely be able to issue partial refunds to all of our donors.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the college transitions online during the semester:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our first step will be to apply for exceptions allowing us to remain on-campus.</li>
<li> We may attempt to secure alternate accommodations while remaining in Ithaca, producing the remaining episodes there.</li>
<li>Barring that, we will invest the remaining budget into a reworked, remotely-produced version of the concept or a similar concept.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why <i>Wormhole?</i>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Wormhole</i> is a unique solution to a very strange, new problem: how to create something collaborative during a global pandemic without sacrificing safety? Not only will the show provide a creative outlet for the six residents of apartment G26-2, we'll also be working with a wide variety of student writers, composers, voice actors, and post-production artists to make this dream a reality.</li>
<li>We also believe that the show taps into the oftentimes discomforting experience of lockdown, quarantine, and isolation in a fun, weird, and exciting way. With this next year still looking as murky as it does, this is the perfect time for this concept to come to fruition.</li>

Jerald heard William's life story about growing up with the ability to see beings unseen by his family and others. William also as an adult used his abilities as a Psychic Medium for law enforcement and also for others not quite in line with the authorities.  Jerald when right away with weaving an epic series and after meetings came up with the name, ""3rd Eye"".</p><p>Our cast includes stars such as: Alexandra Paul, Byron Cherry, Chris Yanke, Marty Klebaa, Jason Stuart, Jeremy Miller, Kelly Perine, Ken Davitian, Larry Thomas, Mel Novak, Marion Ramsey, Patrick Kilpatrick, Jose Perez</p><p>Supporting cast: Alexandra Keller, Anita Clay, Ashley Monroe, Brandon Duracher, Danny Arroyo, Jerald Garner, Joycelyn Lew, Monica Smith, Sandra Hinojosa, Spencer Conner</p><p> </p><p>Jerald Garner met William Constantine through William's manager. William's discussed his abilities with Jerald and a true case of a missing child that William was able to pin-point where the body was via his medium abilities. The case was a sad one but proved again that some mediums are actually able to help with cases. Jerald told William of his encounters with the paranormal in his life then wove a story that could be a series based loosely on William's life. The next day Jerald called a meeting with William and his manager and pitched a 4 season long TV Series. The team they began to add to the series and help weave an intricate, exciting, scary, provocative universe. We meet with Jeremy Miller whom everyone remembers as one of America's most lovable child/teen stars. Jeremy was now matured, buff, cut, solid specimen of a man yet still had that boyish charm and twinkle in his eye. We all knew HE was it! He would be our lead! The character will start off in a bad place, so there will be an arch and Jeremy's acting abilities will be tested but the team has the utmost confidence in Jeremy. The production quickly gained momentum and was able to acquire many seasoned, talented actors known to many around the world. The production soon was bombarded by fans to know when was the series to start. Feeling the  pressure the production team had to develop a plan to raise the funds for a proof concept trailer for <strong>$50K</strong>. We can shoot the pilot if we reach <strong>$100K</strong> or full season if we reach <strong>$500K</strong>. We know that the series subjects are universal from all over the globe.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497463029/kbkozc7srjajrzam0ij4.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The series will take you on a terrifying roller coaster ride through government cover-ups, secret societies, paranormal phenomenon and issues the world faces daily.

With all his abilities, he can’t get a spiritual reading on her nor can he see her killer. He must work with the NSA as a medium and remote viewer to track down and stop threats to the U.S. and its allies. In return, the NSA helps him track down the elusive killer of his heart and they will not shut down his orphanage. </p><p>After the NSA agents pick him up, an organized Persian crime syndicate grabs him. They begin torturing him to uncover how he knew about a money laundering operation that was shut down due to him tipping off a local cop. Knowing they had no intention of letting him live he thinks fast enough to tip the crime boss of the infidelity involving his wife and one of his best friend (his right-hand man). Seeing an opportunity and usefulness to such insight the boss lets him live in exchange for him to use his medium abilities to assist and further his crime business whenever he needs and to keep the government off his back. Of course, the government wants to stop organized crime as it affects national security. The Persian crime leader’s right hand man escapes death to fight back another day.</p><p>Feeling abandoned by his psychic ability he gambled away most of his fortune and used what remained attempting to locate his wife’s murderer. </p><p>One of the only things he has left is working to keep an orphanage he has founded running. </p><p>He still performs stage shows and readings to help people to do all he can to keep the orphanage running – it’s the only thing he has that meant anything to his wife. </p><p>Many of the kids at the orphanage are gifted in many areas and he helps them stay out of trouble and find their path.</p><p>The NSA Agent and the Persian crime lord know each other and have been at war in the past.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497269376/qoact5fpgmc5aboeeeyq.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497269788/dq05bhfzn7xgwjzqfjdc.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498248353/hukk303qikix1b9vzozb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Originally from Houston, TX, Jerald first got his feet wet in the limelight at 17 years old, when he was doing some modeling jobs for department store ads.

Jerald heard William's life story about growing up with the ability to see beings unseen by his family and others. William also as an adult used his abilities as a Psychic Medium for law enforcement and also for others not quite in line with the authorities.  Jerald when right away with weaving an epic series and after meetings came up with the name, ""3rd Eye"".Our cast includes stars such as: Alexandra Paul, Byron Cherry, Chris Yanke, Marty Klebaa, Jason Stuart, Jeremy Miller, Kelly Perine, Ken Davitian, Larry Thomas, Mel Novak, Marion Ramsey, Patrick Kilpatrick, Jose PerezSupporting cast: Alexandra Keller, Anita Clay, Ashley Monroe, Brandon Duracher, Danny Arroyo, Jerald Garner, Joycelyn Lew, Monica Smith, Sandra Hinojosa, Spencer Conner Jerald Garner met William Constantine through William's manager. William's discussed his abilities with Jerald and a true case of a missing child that William was able to pin-point where the body was via his medium abilities. The case was a sad one but proved again that some mediums are actually able to help with cases. Jerald told William of his encounters with the paranormal in his life then wove a story that could be a series based loosely on William's life. The next day Jerald called a meeting with William and his manager and pitched a 4 season long TV Series. The team they began to add to the series and help weave an intricate, exciting, scary, provocative universe. We meet with Jeremy Miller whom everyone remembers as one of America's most lovable child/teen stars. Jeremy was now matured, buff, cut, solid specimen of a man yet still had that boyish charm and twinkle in his eye. We all knew HE was it! He would be our lead! The character will start off in a bad place, so there will be an arch and Jeremy's acting abilities will be tested but the team has the utmost confidence in Jeremy. The production quickly gained momentum and was able to acquire many seasoned, talented actors known to many around the world. The production soon was bombarded by fans to know when was the series to start. Feeling the  pressure the production team had to develop a plan to raise the funds for a proof concept trailer for $50K. We can shoot the pilot if we reach $100K or full season if we reach $500K. We know that the series subjects are universal from all over the globe. The series will take you on a terrifying roller coaster ride through government cover-ups, secret societies, paranormal phenomenon and issues the world faces daily. Our protagonist, a psychic medium, William Kane, will be played by Jeremy Miller (Growing Pains) and will navigate the treacherous waters of the aforementioned issues and more as he exhausts all avenues on finding the serial killer who brutally murdered his wife.The character of William Kane is based on real-life psychic medium, William Constantine, who is a writer, producer and an adviser for the series offer insights on the struggle of life as a psychic medium may bring and his vast knowledge and experience with the paranormal.Unlike other shows that have featured psychic mediums as the main character “3rd Eye” will be as scary as it is riveting and will keep viewers on the edge of their seats and may even give rise to people thinking twice about turning off the lights at night. The series will chronicle the life of William Kane but will also introduce you to the macro plot of what has happened to human existence in the past present and future.We are inspired by sci-fi movies, books and magazine of the early 20th Century, as well as magazines in the 70s and 80s like Omni with concepts of the strange beings, disappearances, government conspiracies, human origin, MIBs, monsters, alternate realities, alien encounters, human super abilities and more.We will have the style of Person of Interest meets, Stranger Things, meets Millennium. We have amazing sci-fi and horror writers, graphic artist, SPFX people, stunt team and known actors to help us create this world of 3rd Eye and show you many of the stories you may have read in the newspapers, seen on TV or read in books on strange events and we will provide you with a climactic explanation of why the events are happening in the world and what is going to happen.This series is inspired from the life of a real medium, William Constantine. This series will not be the campy, comical series many are used to, rather this will be a very serious, plausible styled heavy drama. William Kane, a fall from grace psychic medium -- a man gifted with the ability to perceive and speak with Angels, Demons and “other” inter-dimensional beings -- has spent all his money searching for his wife’s killer. With all his abilities, he can’t get a spiritual reading on her nor can he see her killer. He must work with the NSA as a medium and remote viewer to track down and stop threats to the U.S. and its allies. In return, the NSA helps him track down the elusive killer of his heart and they will not shut down his orphanage. After the NSA agents pick him up, an organized Persian crime syndicate grabs him. They begin torturing him to uncover how he knew about a money laundering operation that was shut down due to him tipping off a local cop. Knowing they had no intention of letting him live he thinks fast enough to tip the crime boss of the infidelity involving his wife and one of his best friend (his right-hand man). Seeing an opportunity and usefulness to such insight the boss lets him live in exchange for him to use his medium abilities to assist and further his crime business whenever he needs and to keep the government off his back. Of course, the government wants to stop organized crime as it affects national security. The Persian crime leader’s right hand man escapes death to fight back another day.Feeling abandoned by his psychic ability he gambled away most of his fortune and used what remained attempting to locate his wife’s murderer. One of the only things he has left is working to keep an orphanage he has founded running. He still performs stage shows and readings to help people to do all he can to keep the orphanage running – it’s the only thing he has that meant anything to his wife. Many of the kids at the orphanage are gifted in many areas and he helps them stay out of trouble and find their path.The NSA Agent and the Persian crime lord know each other and have been at war in the past.    Originally from Houston, TX, Jerald first got his feet wet in the limelight at 17 years old, when he was doing some modeling jobs for department store ads. When he was 21 years old, he joined the United States Air Force. During his time in the military he received a college degree and went on to become a data communications engineer and consultant. While visiting Los Angeles one day he was invited by a producer to be a featured guest in a MTV-show. Acting and working for managers and producers in Hollywood, Jerald eventually became founder of Unseen Forces Productions. He has over 10 years of production and writing experience. He does not take no for an answer and if you believe it can be done then he will go the distance with you and make it happen! With nearly two decades of experience of being a professional psychic medium with international acclaim he has been called in on; Animal Behavioral Issues, Jury selection, Families of Murdered or Missing Persons, Consultation with Law Enforcement, etc. His work as a Psychic Detective caught Nancy Grace’s attention which led to her featuring Constantine as an expert on her show. Currently, Constantine is an independent consultant for a Baron Investigative Group which has offices in both Indiana and Florida. Robert has been shooting feature films and music videos for 15 years. Robert was singled out for his cinematography, with positive reviews from both Roger Ebert and Anthony Lane of the New Yorker: ""Photographed in glorious black and white by Robert Murphy."" --Roger Eber From a young age Avery Bailey’s love for Character Design, Animation, and Film sent him on a journey of discovery about the importance of speed, accuracy, and versatility.

Avery’s main concern in this life is being a consummate professional and a beneficial part to the team.  Our fans are truly the best in the world.

We’ll cut it together then post the scenes, one by one,  every week.</span></p>
<p>For every scene, our team is taking risks, attempting something bizarre, or breaking the “rules” of filmmaking. Whether it’s designing the set around an unorthodox colour scheme, or drilling a hole in a lens just to see what it looks like, we are open to trying everything. We’re willing to bet that some amazing modica of cinema will come out of it, even if some scenes are downright awful. It's all part of the process!</p>

<p><strong>Ok, yeah, I'll help you out.</strong></p>
<p>Amazing! Thank you so much for your interest and support for this project. You're the best. </p>
</div></div>","Uh, who are you?
We are Matthew Segal and Robin Blanchard. 

Two filmmakers and cinema lovers from Toronto. Oh, and also the creators of the Modica Project. We aim to answer all our questions and curiosities about the tools available, techniques, story structure, and the intricacies of visual storytelling. 
Think of us as the Mythbusters of cinema. 

Cool! But how does it work?
The Modica Project is inspired by the ""One Word Story"" game, where each person in a circle says a single word to continue the story. For our project,  a different writer is going to submit a single scene to us each week.  Then, over the next week, we are going to prep and shoot it. We’ll cut it together then post the scenes, one by one,  every week.
For every scene, our team is taking risks, attempting something bizarre, or breaking the “rules” of filmmaking. Whether it’s designing the set around an unorthodox colour scheme, or drilling a hole in a lens just to see what it looks like, we are open to trying everything. We’re willing to bet that some amazing modica of cinema will come out of it, even if some scenes are downright awful. It's all part of the process!
You can come along for the journey by watching our weekly Scene Study videos, similar to a ""roundtable"" segment,  where we discuss what worked, what didn’t, how we achieved (or flubbed) different aspects, and share everything that we’ve learned.

I dig it. But that sounds like it's gonna be tough...
We are up for the Challenge! In fact, we are beyond excited to explore filmmaking in a way that we've never been able to before. We're itching to see the story as it unfolds each week, and buzzing about the experiments that our awesome team will come up with. Putting restrictions on ourselves is going to help us grow, so it's worth it. 

If you say so. But what's the money for?

Making movies ain't cheap! We are looking for a budget of around $1100 - $1300 each week. This is going to feed our crew, get people in and out on time, and keep things going smoothly. We are aiming to for this season to go for around 8 weeks. We crunched them numbers and our micro budget came to $10,000. We'd love your help with that.
The budget breaks down like this:
30% Art Dept. (Props, Set Dec, Wardrobe)
10% Camera
20% Craft (Gotta Eat!)
17% Locations 
15% Contingency
8% Indiegogo Fees
And if you don't reach your goal?
We are making this project anyways! Each contribution gives us more freedom to explore and attempt more ambitious challenges/endeavours. So, every little bit you can give lets us share more valuable lessons. It's a win/win.

<h3><strong>What we are doing: </strong></h3>
<p>Hi, this is Gene. Today I want to tell you about Rasputin Project and why we need your support. Recently, Alexey Navalny, Kremlin's most fierce critic was sentenced to 2.5 years in jail. Just before his trial, his team of investigative journalists released, 'Putin’s Palace: The story of the biggest bribe in history.</p>
<p>In August 2020, Navalny was poisoned on a domestic flight. After falling into a coma, he was transferred to a hospital in Germany in order to save his life. Navalny was under surveillance by a group of operatives from the unit for 3 years and there may have been earlier attempts to poison Navalny. Upon his return to Russia in January 2021, Navalny was immediately imprisoned upon charges of “Violating Probation”, based on previous fraudulent charges of embezzlement for his brother’s involvement in Yves Rocher.</p>

<p>In 2016, I embarked on a wildly ambitious voyage: visit vintage stores in NYC and create a reality show about them. A vintage voyage, if you will.<br/>I remember the first cold calls I made to some of my favorite shops.<br/>‘Hi, my name is Allison, and I have this idea for a new show…’<br/>I had no body of work to present, no fancy press kit, not even a super well thought out pitch, but I had a lot of heart and passion to back up my idea (not to mention my extensive, if not obsessive, knowledge on vintage clothing). I knew that if I played my cards right, the show would be unique and entertaining. To my delight, my vision translated well over the phone and within a matter of weeks my videographer, Nikhil, and I were filming all across Manhattan.<br/><br/>Now, over two years later, it’s incredible to look back at the fantastic voyage this project has taken me on. In two seasons I’ve covered 17 stores, traveling out of New York to visit shops all over America. The show has been nominated for multiple awards, including Best Unscripted in the NYC Web Fest, featured on fashion blogs, and even given me the surreal opportunity to walk in NYFW’s first vintage fashion show. However, the greatest thing this project has brought into my life has been the store owners, entrepreneurs, and creatives that have provided wonderful lessons on and off camera, making the show what it is today. It's also inspired countless viewers to get out and shop their local vintage stores and find their own personal style through fashions of the past.<br/><br/>But now I'm ready to take it to the next level with SEASON 3! That's right! You guys have asked for it, and I am so ready to bring you new and exciting shopping adventures. This season, I want to cover more vintage stores in America (and some across the pond as well). I want to expand our knowledge of the vintage community to not just cover vintage clothing, but vintage furniture, cars and events. I want to continue to bring you guys the things you love like Vintage 101's and fashion history lessons, but bring in new aspects to the show, such as featuring other vintage enthusiasts so you can see how other people style their vintage. And finally, I want to show you how things are made and how to repair your beloved vintage items.<br/><br/>To bring these dreams to life I need more minds and more hands to help. Up to this point the show has been self-produced, with the majority of pre and post production being done on my own. With a growing following, it is time to refine and elevate the content of this show and I can’t do it alone. That's why I am asking for your help to raise $30,000! This is money that will go straight into production and help with equipment costs, permits, travel, lodging, advertisements, and will allow me to bring on industry professionals to help make the show the best it can be. </p>
<p>And of course the more you donate, the more fun prizes you'll receive, including discounts to stores, behind the scenes footage while we're on the road, one on one skype fashion consultations, and for very generous givers, you're own personal vintage voyage with me!</p>
<p>This is a project that is so near and dear to my heart. To this day, it is the ONLY series highlighting the incredible vintage selling community, which is predominantly woman run, and kicking ass as it's growing at a massive rate (projected to be worth $41 BILLION by 2022 according to ThredUp.com). It also brings to light the advantages of shopping small business and shopping sustainably in a time when fast fashion is having a drastic and negative impact on our environment.</p>
<p>If you're ready for more vintage voyages, press that 'Back It' button and give what you can!</p>
<p>Also, SHARE with a friend. If there's anything I've learned from the vintage community, it's all about collaboration. When we come together, amazing things happen!</p>
<p><br/>So what are we waiting for?Let’s get shopping, and go on an adventure!’</p>

</h2><p><b>*It's not incidental that we're launching this project during the national COVID-19 quarantine here in Italy. We had intended to self-finance this series but we recently had to cancel nine months of food and wine classes and refund all the tution. A school with no students is no longer a school, at least for the time being. Once the COVID- 19 quarantine is lifted we can begin production (the short video above is intended as something of a placeholder and was edited together from existing footage, as no one is allowed outside to film). </b></p><p><b>If you value what we do as a school please consider joining us in the project that follows.</b></p><p>I’m Silvestro Silvestori here in Italy. </p><p>For the last 17 years we've been teaching the food and wine of Puglia to students from 59 different countries. To stay stimulated as a teacher, I've taken a yearly sabbatical to travel southern Italy, almost always by bicycle. I study the wine. </p><p> Wine is like art. You could talk at length about a 16th century Dutch painting without ever mentioning that it's yellow. That's because you'd be using the painting as a starting point to discuss all the sociological, anthropological, historical elements of its era. Yes, wine is a beverage but it's also a litmus of a region's geography,  culture, history, cuisine, climate and the deeply-woven sense of cultural patrimony. </p><p> </p><p><strong>The Short Summary</strong></p><p> </p><p>*Told in 10, 22 minute episodes- a pilot and then 9, unique historical growing zones- Terronia is the story of southern Italian wine as taught by an interdisciplinary school teacher</p><p>*Rather than the blackboard of the classroom I use chalk on the side of abandoned farm houses to explain fermentation, the effects of the Ottoman invasions, why baroque could only follow the protestant reformation, why grapes need foxes, birds and wolves, how we almost lost all of wine to disease, etc. </p><p>*Told in a creative non-fiction format, each episode has a strong narrative arc, the 4-act structure reveals the inherent story conflicts in the world of wine, both internal and external. These human and nature-based conflicts climax at act breaks, pulling along the viewer to stay fully engaged in each story</p><p>*Ours is the first generation that ‘prosumer’ technology now allows for one person to write, direct, shoot, edit and promote an entire television series, with all the gear in pannier bags aboard a single bicycle. Cameras, lenses, drone, audio recorders, fast computer for editing, my loaded bicycle is an entire 4k film crew on two wheels</p><p>* While many may see this guerilla- filmmaking as only novelty, it does offer unparalleled Intimacy: a single human presence, small cameras, cell-phone sized audio recorders, intimate relationships that often go back 15 years. The one-man film crew’s small footprint can tease out intimate moments in ways large film crews cannot</p><p><strong>Background </strong></p><p> </p><p>Southern Italy is so different than the rest of Italy that it should probably be a different country. </p><p>Glance at a map, you'll see that Sicily, Calabria, Basilicata and Puglia are all islands and peninsulas, their individual histories cobbled together from thousands of years of countless invasions. </p><p>The four regions have always been seen as bases- the conceptual equivalent of today’s aircraft carriers and pontoon bridges.  Even the name ‘Mediterranean’- Med Terra- or 'Middle of the earth’,  spells out their agreed-upon historical importance. </p><p>Any culture that needed to feed, water and quarter troops, sailors, economic or theological invaders sooner or later came and took everything.</p><p>Over time this caused a resilience in the people and cultures, and a tendency to isolate and trust only those from the same village (literally, the origins of nepotism). </p><p>While these invasions were catastrophic for human beings they ended up being great for wine, individual varietals and growing zones  developed over hundreds and even thousands of years, with little or no communication between regions. </p><p>These are wines of.a place and that relationship is what this series is about. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Few inside or outside of Italy know that: </strong></p><p>*There are 75 isolated communities in the south that do not speak Italian as their first language. They arrived between 400 to 2,700 years, maintaining their language, culture, cuisine and even autochthonous strains of religion the entire time</p><p>*For the last 120 years, a forced and ongoing exodus out of Italy has largely depopulated large parts of the south. The people that you know of Italian descent in your country are paradoxically 1) of southern extraction and 2) Statistically unlikely to ever visit from where their ancestors actually departed</p><p>*That recently humanity has learned that grapes and wine making arrived up from Africa rather than over the Alps, making the south, Italy’s oldest wine culture</p><p>*That producers are reexamining old techniques, such as fermenting in concrete, of training grape vines into free standing trees, of refining with egg whites and to using the yeasts in the bark of the vine rather than the bloom of the fruit. These are not new experimental techniques but head-scratching and eventual acceptance that ancient wine makers knew much more than we often think</p><p> </p><p><strong>What we need and what you get</strong></p><p>This series is a partnership between you and me, and only you can decide if you want to wave from the shore or dive into the deep-end. All is appreciated. And I can’t do this all alone. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What you get</strong></p><p>To learn intimately about a profoundly-compelling part of the world largely unchanged by International tourism. </p><p>The ability to help craft the ten episodes, based on your level of desired participation. Help in research. Proof.a script for punctuation. Just watch the dailies with a glass of the same wine in your hand (yes, I'll tell you which to drink with which episodes). </p><p>Find your new favourite wine. Or nine of them. Likely, even more. </p><p>Use all the information as the foundation of Italian trips for years to come. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What we seek</strong></p><p> </p><p>1) Funding for the production</p><p>2) Beta-testers, on a variety of levels </p><p>3)That you email forward this campaign and updates to your friends that love Italy and Italian wine</p><p>4)That you share this campaign on your Social Media and to any mailing list you may have</p><p>5) That you help in the conservation of heritage wines of the South</p><p>6) That when you visit Italy, you continue to seek new, lesser known regions, where your money aids in preserving the culture</p><p>7) That you someday come take one of our classes here in Puglia. (Anyone interested can book any class now, including the word 'open-ended', in regards to the actual date you'd like to attend. This fixes the price of the course, even after this series debuts) </p><p>8) That you put us in contact with any industry people that you might know that would be interested in this project</p><p>9) That you order our extra virgin sent to your home. It's our only form of income at the moment . We made it. And it's excellent. </p><p> </p><p><strong>How the money will be spent. </strong></p><p>So while this year just freed up a lot of time for production, it also had the financial rug pulled out from under it. </p><p>For the last 20 years I’ve lived within an hour’s drive of 3 of the growing zones. And 2 hour’s drive from 2 more. Most of what we need is the non-glamourous expenses for picnic lunches, family-owned bed and breakfasts in the 4 regions that are out of the range of a day's drive. Plus, fuel, tolls, permits and miscellaneous expenses when I can’t return home at night. </p><p> </p><p>                                                                      13,000 USD</p><p> </p><p>Then some post production help. </p><p> </p><p>Colour grading of final drafts.            4.000 USD</p><p>Final sound mix.                                      7,000 USD</p><p>Final edit consultant                              5,000 USD</p><p>_________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>                                    <strong>                  Total    28,000 USD</strong></p><p> </p><p>*I've opened an American bank account just for this campaign, as Italian taxation is 28% higher than in the States.<strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>About me</strong></p><p> </p><p>I’m a nationally-trained sommelier here in Italy. The president of the republic of Italy actually signed my diploma. </p><p>Our classrooms here in Italy are small enough that I continually study eye contact so that most of the content has been already 'field' tested for years.</p><p>Since 2010, I’ve been a professional, English-language wine magazine journalist, covering only Southern Italian wine.  </p><p>Throughout my life I’ve made short films, both analog and digital.</p><p>I’m bilingual, earning multiple university degrees in humanities, both in Italy and in the US. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Distribution</strong></p><p>The goal is to sell this series while still in production to an international streaming service.

That's because you'd be using the painting as a starting point to discuss all the sociological, anthropological, historical elements of its era. Yes, wine is a beverage but it's also a litmus of a region's geography,  culture, history, cuisine, climate and the deeply-woven sense of cultural patrimony.  The Short Summary *Told in 10, 22 minute episodes- a pilot and then 9, unique historical growing zones- Terronia is the story of southern Italian wine as taught by an interdisciplinary school teacher*Rather than the blackboard of the classroom I use chalk on the side of abandoned farm houses to explain fermentation, the effects of the Ottoman invasions, why baroque could only follow the protestant reformation, why grapes need foxes, birds and wolves, how we almost lost all of wine to disease, etc. *Told in a creative non-fiction format, each episode has a strong narrative arc, the 4-act structure reveals the inherent story conflicts in the world of wine, both internal and external. These human and nature-based conflicts climax at act breaks, pulling along the viewer to stay fully engaged in each story*Ours is the first generation that ‘prosumer’ technology now allows for one person to write, direct, shoot, edit and promote an entire television series, with all the gear in pannier bags aboard a single bicycle. Cameras, lenses, drone, audio recorders, fast computer for editing, my loaded bicycle is an entire 4k film crew on two wheels* While many may see this guerilla- filmmaking as only novelty, it does offer unparalleled Intimacy: a single human presence, small cameras, cell-phone sized audio recorders, intimate relationships that often go back 15 years. The one-man film crew’s small footprint can tease out intimate moments in ways large film crews cannotBackground  Southern Italy is so different than the rest of Italy that it should probably be a different country. Glance at a map, you'll see that Sicily, Calabria, Basilicata and Puglia are all islands and peninsulas, their individual histories cobbled together from thousands of years of countless invasions. The four regions have always been seen as bases- the conceptual equivalent of today’s aircraft carriers and pontoon bridges.  Even the name ‘Mediterranean’- Med Terra- or 'Middle of the earth’,  spells out their agreed-upon historical importance. Any culture that needed to feed, water and quarter troops, sailors, economic or theological invaders sooner or later came and took everything.Over time this caused a resilience in the people and cultures, and a tendency to isolate and trust only those from the same village (literally, the origins of nepotism). While these invasions were catastrophic for human beings they ended up being great for wine, individual varietals and growing zones  developed over hundreds and even thousands of years, with little or no communication between regions. These are wines of.a place and that relationship is what this series is about.  Few inside or outside of Italy know that: *There are 75 isolated communities in the south that do not speak Italian as their first language. They arrived between 400 to 2,700 years, maintaining their language, culture, cuisine and even autochthonous strains of religion the entire time*For the last 120 years, a forced and ongoing exodus out of Italy has largely depopulated large parts of the south. The people that you know of Italian descent in your country are paradoxically 1) of southern extraction and 2) Statistically unlikely to ever visit from where their ancestors actually departed*That recently humanity has learned that grapes and wine making arrived up from Africa rather than over the Alps, making the south, Italy’s oldest wine culture*That producers are reexamining old techniques, such as fermenting in concrete, of training grape vines into free standing trees, of refining with egg whites and to using the yeasts in the bark of the vine rather than the bloom of the fruit. These are not new experimental techniques but head-scratching and eventual acceptance that ancient wine makers knew much more than we often think What we need and what you getThis series is a partnership between you and me, and only you can decide if you want to wave from the shore or dive into the deep-end. All is appreciated. And I can’t do this all alone.  What you getTo learn intimately about a profoundly-compelling part of the world largely unchanged by International tourism. The ability to help craft the ten episodes, based on your level of desired participation. Help in research. Proof.a script for punctuation. Just watch the dailies with a glass of the same wine in your hand (yes, I'll tell you which to drink with which episodes). Find your new favourite wine. Or nine of them. Likely, even more. Use all the information as the foundation of Italian trips for years to come.  What we seek 1) Funding for the production2) Beta-testers, on a variety of levels 3)That you email forward this campaign and updates to your friends that love Italy and Italian wine4)That you share this campaign on your Social Media and to any mailing list you may have5) That you help in the conservation of heritage wines of the South6) That when you visit Italy, you continue to seek new, lesser known regions, where your money aids in preserving the culture7) That you someday come take one of our classes here in Puglia. (Anyone interested can book any class now, including the word 'open-ended', in regards to the actual date you'd like to attend. This fixes the price of the course, even after this series debuts) 8) That you put us in contact with any industry people that you might know that would be interested in this project9) That you order our extra virgin sent to your home. It's our only form of income at the moment . We made it. And it's excellent.  How the money will be spent. So while this year just freed up a lot of time for production, it also had the financial rug pulled out from under it. For the last 20 years I’ve lived within an hour’s drive of 3 of the growing zones. And 2 hour’s drive from 2 more. Most of what we need is the non-glamourous expenses for picnic lunches, family-owned bed and breakfasts in the 4 regions that are out of the range of a day's drive. Plus, fuel, tolls, permits and miscellaneous expenses when I can’t return home at night.                                                                        13,000 USD Then some post production help.  Colour grading of final drafts.            4.000 USDFinal sound mix.                                      7,000 USDFinal edit consultant                              5,000 USD_________________________________________________________                                                       Total    28,000 USD *I've opened an American bank account just for this campaign, as Italian taxation is 28% higher than in the States.  About me I’m a nationally-trained sommelier here in Italy. The president of the republic of Italy actually signed my diploma. Our classrooms here in Italy are small enough that I continually study eye contact so that most of the content has been already 'field' tested for years.Since 2010, I’ve been a professional, English-language wine magazine journalist, covering only Southern Italian wine.  Throughout my life I’ve made short films, both analog and digital.I’m bilingual, earning multiple university degrees in humanities, both in Italy and in the US.  DistributionThe goal is to sell this series while still in production to an international streaming service. If successful sold, all perk fulfillment will be negotiated into the sales agreement.  NetflixAmazonBBCAppleTvTravel ChannelABC.AU If I fail to place this during production, we’ll stream it for individual downloads on Amazon as a series and as individual episodes. All perk fulfillment will be maintained, no matter what.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are raising funds so that we can get our comedic pilot episode, Tia Maria's Cafe, about a Portuguese Canadian family running a coffee shop to TV screens across Canada as a sitcom series! Audiences at our initial screening love Tia Maria's Cafe and want more episodes! We have completely funded this on our own but now we need your support! Your support will enable us to create an awesome pitch package to present to networks! Let's get funny, women driven stories onto screens everywhere!</p>
<p><i>Keep reading to learn more about us and this awesome project!</i></p>
<p>We, Maria and Sandra, became friends when we attended high school together at Sir Charles Tupper in East Vancouver, sharing a love for theatre, fashion and crazy schemes. Over the years, we have been big supporters of each other's theatrical pursuits and with decades of theatre, film and TV experience between us, we partnered in 2016 to create Portuguese Buns Productions. </p>
<p>Through this dynamic partnership, we created FESTA!, the hilarious immersive play where we played ALL the members of a typical Portuguese familia! FESTA! was such a hit at the 2016 Vancouver Fringe Festival that we remounted it as an even bigger FESTA! the following year!</p>
<p>We could see how our funny, endearing stories resonated with all people. Everyone could relate to the stories and characters that were brought to life and they wanted more. That is how Tia Maria's Cafe was born!</p>
<p>Tia Maria's Cafe is an inter-generational story of a Portuguese-Canadian family running a coffee shop. When Momma Maria hands over the family coffee shop to her daughter Claudia and daughter-in-law Maria, they try to put their own contemporary stamp on it. But they have to deal with Momma Maria who wants them to keep the cafe old school! Rounding out the quirky family is Manuel, Maria's hardworking (when he wants to be!) husband and their sassy tween daughter Meaghan. Of course, there are always some colourful characters who stop by for a coffee or pastry!</p>

<p>There are always challenges with any project. However, Portuguese Buns Productions are comprised of two determined Portuguese women who are not afraid of hard work! We have an excellent track record - we had a very successful, near sold-out run at the Vancouver International Fringe Festival with FESTA! and when we remounted the show the following year, we made it even bigger and had local groups eager to join us on FESTA! 2.0, such as  the Portuguese Filaharmonic Band of Vancouver, Rancho Folclorico Cruz de Cristo as well as BC authors and accordian players.  Also, when we filmed Tia Maria's Cafe, we were able to secure a local Bell Media TV celebrity!</p>
<p>We are determined that Tia Maria's Cafe is a real success. We have been working on it for the past two years and we are very excited about our proof of concept pilot - it's funny,  endearing and will appeal to a wide audience. We have a phenomenal team in place who have helped create this project and we have many wonderful allies in the community who we can lean on through this journey. Portuguese Buns are resourceful, creative and resilient and we are extremely committed to the success of Tia Maria's Cafe!</p>

<p><i><strong>Maria J. Cruz - Director/Producer/Writer/Actor</strong></i></p>
<p>Maria has worked in the performing arts since the late 90s (BA, Theatre, UBC). Maria’s experience includes acting, writing and producing for both film and theatre and most recently taking on first-time directing duties for TIA MARIA’S CAFÉ - our pilot pitch project for television. In recent years she has written a lot of her own work, much of it exploring her identity as a Portuguese-Canadian. Specifically, two one-woman shows – The Castro Project, part of Portuguese Heritage Month in 2008, and The Kilometres to 40, chosen for the Azores International Fringe Festival in Pico, Portugal in 2014. Other favourite theatre credits include anything where she can wear a corset and sass people: Toinette in Moliere’s The Imaginary Invalid, Sylvia in The Soldier’s Fortune and Lady Politic Would-Be in Volpone - all for United Players. In 2016 she partnered with fellow Portuguese-Canadian actor and old friend, Sandra Medeiros to form Portuguese Buns Productions. They had the near sold-out run of FESTA! An immersive intergenerational theatrical experience at the Vancouver Fringe Festival and a successful remount the following year. Maria’s first love is and always will be acting. Recent television credits include the collaborative female-led independent film project The Parties, along with cult favourites Riverdale, iZombie and DC Legends of Tomorrow. Watch her this month in a guest-starring role on Disney’s kids show Gabby Duran &amp; the Unsittables and voicing the wonderfully warm character of “Abuelita Howler” on Netflix’s SuperMonsters.</p>

<p><i><strong>Sandra Medeiros, Writer/Producer/Actor</strong></i></p>
<p>Sandra has been so thrilled to partner up with her fellow Portuguese-Canadian friend Maria in the creation of Portuguese Buns Productions and embarking on this fun adventure of telling stories about their families and culture.  FESTA! was a huge hit at the Vancouver Fringe Festival, as was its remount, and Sandra had the best time playing multiple characters, such as Pai (Dad) and Madrinha (godmother).  The pitch pilot project Tia Maria's Cafe has been just as great a journey and she's excited for the next step. Sandra is a theatre director and producer and is also co-artistic director of the award-winning theatre company Naked Goddess Productions.</p>

</div></div>","We are raising funds so that we can get our comedic pilot episode, Tia Maria's Cafe, about a Portuguese Canadian family running a coffee shop to TV screens across Canada as a sitcom series! Audiences at our initial screening love Tia Maria's Cafe and want more episodes! We have completely funded this on our own but now we need your support! Your support will enable us to create an awesome pitch package to present to networks! Let's get funny, women driven stories onto screens everywhere!
Keep reading to learn more about us and this awesome project!
We, Maria and Sandra, became friends when we attended high school together at Sir Charles Tupper in East Vancouver, sharing a love for theatre, fashion and crazy schemes. Over the years, we have been big supporters of each other's theatrical pursuits and with decades of theatre, film and TV experience between us, we partnered in 2016 to create Portuguese Buns Productions. 
Through this dynamic partnership, we created FESTA!, the hilarious immersive play where we played ALL the members of a typical Portuguese familia! FESTA! was such a hit at the 2016 Vancouver Fringe Festival that we remounted it as an even bigger FESTA! the following year!
We could see how our funny, endearing stories resonated with all people. Everyone could relate to the stories and characters that were brought to life and they wanted more. That is how Tia Maria's Cafe was born!
Tia Maria's Cafe is an inter-generational story of a Portuguese-Canadian family running a coffee shop. When Momma Maria hands over the family coffee shop to her daughter Claudia and daughter-in-law Maria, they try to put their own contemporary stamp on it. But they have to deal with Momma Maria who wants them to keep the cafe old school! Rounding out the quirky family is Manuel, Maria's hardworking (when he wants to be!) husband and their sassy tween daughter Meaghan. Of course, there are always some colourful characters who stop by for a coffee or pastry!
 

​
With your help, we can bring these heartwarming, hilarious stories to the screen, to be enjoyed by all people who appreciate an honest take on what it means to be a family. We know that people all around world will be able to relate to the stories we have to tell, about straddling a world of keeping old traditions and creating new ones.
Come be a member of our familia!


They say it takes a village to raise a family and it certainly will take a village to create Tia Maria's Cafe! We can't wait for you to be part of our village and we've got some great Portuguese perks for you!
We want to share Tia Maria's Cafe with all of Canada and our goal is to have our story told on TV in a sitcom style, like CBC's Kim's Convenience. This is going to take a lot of work, time and funds....this is why we need your help!
We have created our proof of concept pilot for Tia Maria's Cafe and to take it to the next level, we need to raise $7000. 
 



Create a professional pitch package so that we can confidently present our project to TV Producers and Executives
Produce a 3-5 minute pitch video
Set up meetings with producers/executives
Create more episode outlines and scripts

We have some great perks that you will love!

Signed posters and yummy Portuguese treats
Portuguese-style organization and tidying up for your place!!
Ever wanted to learn Portuguese before your big trip? We have you covered.



The world right now is eager for interesting, heartwarming, culture-specific stories told from a unique perspective and we are here to deliver! 

Tia Maria's Cafe is a comedy written from a female perspective, which is still rare in the comedy world and the world is ready for us!
We offer that unique viewpoint of Portuguese-Canadian culture and we know it's relatable to all cultures based on the feedback we received with our play FESTA!
We have a lot of confidence in our project based on the success of FESTA!

 


""If you are Portuguese, don't miss this show. If you're not Portuguese, this is a fun chance to peek inside someone else's culture and experience the amazing thing that happens when an audience has the rare opportunity to see themselves reflected.""
""Laugh out loud the entire time!! Really really funny! It's a must see!""
""Loved the Portuguese traditions bumping up against Canadian life, told from a female perspective.""


Portuguese Buns Productions recently had a private screening of Tia Maria's Cafe to show our pitch project to our cast, crew, volunteers and families.
""Looking forward to seeing ""Tia Maria´s Café"" in the small screen!""
""I still want to watch it again and again!!!""
""Loved it last night...very proud of all of you!!""
""It was funny and sure hits home as to how we were all brought up...I look forward to seeing more.""


There are always challenges with any project. However, Portuguese Buns Productions are comprised of two determined Portuguese women who are not afraid of hard work! We have an excellent track record - we had a very successful, near sold-out run at the Vancouver International Fringe Festival with FESTA! and when we remounted the show the following year, we made it even bigger and had local groups eager to join us on FESTA! 2.0, such as  the Portuguese Filaharmonic Band of Vancouver, Rancho Folclorico Cruz de Cristo as well as BC authors and accordian players.  Also, when we filmed Tia Maria's Cafe, we were able to secure a local Bell Media TV celebrity!
We are determined that Tia Maria's Cafe is a real success. We have been working on it for the past two years and we are very excited about our proof of concept pilot - it's funny,  endearing and will appeal to a wide audience. We have a phenomenal team in place who have helped create this project and we have many wonderful allies in the community who we can lean on through this journey. Portuguese Buns are resourceful, creative and resilient and we are extremely committed to the success of Tia Maria's Cafe!


We understand if you are not able to contribute right now! But you can still help us and we will be extremely grateful!!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm sure your dying to know what the series is about? Well, let me tell you.</p>
<p>Abby is a detective who is investigating the disappearance of her father. During her investigation, she runs into Luther and gains special abilities that help her slowly learn the truth as to why her father disappeared 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Filmmaking, to us, is the ultimate medium to tell a story of triumph, heartbreak, and so much more. With the Trace pilot, I want to utilize the series as a creative outlet for everyone involved to break off a piece of themselves and express it visually and acoustically. And that, in part, is how I want to utilize this campaign.<br/>Another way (quite frankly, most important, IMO) is you, the audience! Not only do we want to create something meaningful for us, but our main focus is to create something meaningful, epic, and engaging for YOU! Yes, you! Filmmaking is such a wonderful experience to be a part of and we want you to be absolutely proud to be a part of that wonderful experience! I mean, how cool would it be to say, ""Yea, I was a part of that!"" Pretty badass, right?<br/>I truly know I have a great story to tell and share when the characters in the story are in the driver's seat, writing and building their world that they live in and reacting to it.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I want this campaign and us as filmmakers, actors, and actresses to be the ship, the vessel, and you are the fuel! Trace has a dedicated and talented group of people who all strive and are ready to make this the very best series it can possibly be! We want this to be exclusive and an overall fun opportunity for everyone including you (teamwork makes the dreamwork)!<br/>We as a team, want you to join us on our epic journey and relish in the sweet contributions from us to you when you select a certain perk(s). All of them will allow you to dive into the pilot and be fully engaged with the process from start to finish (dang, that sounds good)!<br/>But how will the funds raised be used? Well, we have this colorful graph to explain just that!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Trace family values everyone's time so we want to respectfully compensate and recognize everyone involved for their hard work and talent. But most importantly being able to allow those involved to proudly have an important place among the project as a whole!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What project doesn't have its fair share of risks and challenges? We will undoubtedly run into some along the way but that what makes it worth fighting for! Here some we may face:</p>
<p><br/>1. Securing locations pertaining to the story<br/>2. Creating Abby's special abilities visually on screen<br/>3. Using practical effects vs. special FX / CGI<br/>4. Overall production scheduling including talent and crew<br/>5. Managing all the moving parts of the pilot from pre-production to post-production<br/>6. Not securing everything we need for the pilot (locations, props, talent)<br/>7. Not reaching the right audience/demographic for the pilot and series as a whole</p>
<p><br/>Despite those possible challenges and risks, I am very confident in the Trace team to tackle them head-on and find creative solutions to them so that we can share a story worth telling.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Everyone can help and support Trace in the biggest and smallest ways! We need love and support not only through contributions but through joining our mailing list! We want to keep you updated on our campaign and overall progress (because, after all, this a collaborative team effort)! You can also help by tracking and sharing our journey through our website (<a href=""http://www.tracewebseries.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tracewebseries.com</a>) and social media Platforms like Instagram: @tracewebseries Twitter: @tracewebseries Facebook: Trace Web Series and spreading the word with your family, friends and whoever else you can think of!

<p>We are asking for a lot, animation is expensive. Most 22 min series shows cost roughly $500,000 per episode, some a lot more and some for less. We will be producing 65 mins of animation for a fraction of what a full season budget would be for other animated shows. This will be thanks to carefully designing each episode to be cost effective allowing us to pull off this feat while paying our artists fair wages with fair quota's! Mimsy and Dusty will be easily accessible online through our YouTube channel and other online platforms. Anyone with access to the internet will be able to follow along with Mimsy and Dusty's adventures!</p>
<p>My experience involves creating or directing animation content for film, games, TV and mobile entertainment. I was fortunate to work for Disney Interactive on their marketing team from 2011 to 2014. My role was as an animator, story artist and I even got to direct TVC spots! It was here where I learned that the impossible dream can become a very rich and fulfilling reality, you just have to go for it!</p>
<p>The ""Mimsy and Dusty"" property is about combining learning, laughing and fun! Using song and dance, these short animated episodes will help deliver fundamental lessons to the pre-school demographic. Lessons like the ABC's and 123""s, the importance of sharing, exploring the wonders of the world around you in a safe way!! My wife and I have a large family and very curious kids. I use their curiosity and amazing questions as my inspiration. </p>

<h3>Our Dream</h3>
<p>Watching our children soaking up the content provided on YouTube is like watching ourselves glued to the television for Saturday morning cartoons when we were little. These same Saturday morning cartoons were what inspired my career in animation. My children over the years have often asked me ""Daddy, why don't you make your own cartoon?"". Today's methods of distribution such as YouTube has opened the door to be able to pursue that for my children and myself much more easily than in years past.</p>
<p>My career world is changing into a very family oriented business. Our whole family acts as sounding boards, contributors and artists. Taking time to work for clients is great and certainly pays the bills but being able to create and produce a property that our whole family has helped dream up is uniquely fulfilling and creates a better impact and legacy for our family.</p>

These same Saturday morning cartoons were what inspired my career in animation. My children over the years have often asked me ""Daddy, why don't you make your own cartoon?"". Today's methods of distribution such as YouTube has opened the door to be able to pursue that for my children and myself much more easily than in years past.
My career world is changing into a very family oriented business. Our whole family acts as sounding boards, contributors and artists. Taking time to work for clients is great and certainly pays the bills but being able to create and produce a property that our whole family has helped dream up is uniquely fulfilling and creates a better impact and legacy for our family.

<p>Detox is a dark comedy digital series about a group of friends whose lives are spinning out of control. Harmony has a million followers online, but her life is a straight up mess. Becca thinks motherhood is her calling, but her uterus just doesn't agree. Delia's positive she's has the formula for the perfect relationship, but the dude isn't calling her back. What's a girl to do when she's not the one in control? Go on a cleanse, of course!</p>

<p>We've noticed that <a href=""http://goop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GOOPY</a> ideas about health and beauty make the answer to all your problems sound simple.</p>
<p><strong>Not happy with your life? Purge some toxins with a cleanse!</strong></p>
<p>From blogs to billboards, we're being told that quick, easy fixes to our environment or behavior can yield dramatic life-changing results.</p>
<p><strong>Feeling depressed &amp; heavy ? Time to cut out gluten!</strong></p>
<p>Body detoxes and juice cleanses, backed by the glamour of celebrity endorsements, grant us the <i>illusion</i> of control over our lives. </p>
<p><strong>I drank only juice for 3 days straight and I’VE NEVER FELT BETTER. </strong></p>
<p>But real life doesn’t work that way...</p>
<p>Real life is messy. And complicated. And sometimes even toxic. (<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/health/juice-cleanse-toxin-misconception.html?_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What's a toxin?</a> We don't know for sure. But we know it's bad.) Real life includes eating solid food and making mistakes and apologizing when we've been an asshole (sorry, Mom!)</p>
<p>We've noticed that our idea of detoxing in various forms from juice cleanses to cleaning out our closets is serving a larger purpose than losing weight or having less junk--we've been using it as <a href=""https://thinkprogress.org/is-gwyneth-paltrow-wrong-about-everything-this-researcher-thinks-so-d949c7341f63#.soskohvz5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">spiritual purification</a>. Simplify. Cleanse. Start Over. </p>
<p>Like most people, Harmony, Becca, and Delia are the hardest on themselves. Living up to these unattainable ideas of health, beauty, and an instagram-worthy life is an immense amount of pressure. They're bound to crack at some point...</p>
<p><i><strong>This is the story of DETOX.</strong></i></p>

<p>When we first set out to create this project, our prompt was for each of us to write and develop a character that we'd never had the opportunity to play.</p>
<p>We realized that most of the female characters we've played have had to be ""likeable.""</p>
<p>That got us thinking: some of our favorite male characters (Tony Soprano, Jesse Pinkman, Don Draper) are grotesque and unlikeable, yet given a lot of leeway to be the flawed complicated characters we love to see.</p>
<p>Why can't female characters be the same way? So we created three women who are a bit offensive and gross, but dynamic, fascinating, bold, and heart-breakingly human. We're telling stories that speak deeply to us as individuals, and hopefully our audience will feel the same.</p>

<p><strong>Harmony</strong> is on day three of her juice cleanse, sharing the positive results she’s experienced thus far on her YouTube channel. In a flash of Instagram photography, we see what Harmony’s hard-partying reckless life has really involved: dancing on bars, snorting coke in bathrooms, brunching with friends, and passing out at strangers’ houses. Despite not being a writer, she’s landed a book deal based on her growing YouTube subscriber base. She clearly has no idea how to begin writing a book, much less complete one. On a bad day, Harmony is a low-functioning, wanna-be celebrity with a serious drinking problem. On a good day, she’s a fucking riot. Harmony, while being a complete and total mess, brightens up any room she enters with her energy and amazing sense of humor.</p>

<p>Harmony’s perfectionist sister-in-law, <strong>Becca</strong>, has always done everything right. Everything she’s wanted, she’s gotten on her timeline: acceptance to a top law school, a great job, a loving marriage. Next up on her timeline is a baby, but she can’t seem to bring a pregnancy to term. Becca avoids expressing her pain to her sister Delia, husband Wes, and even to herself. She opts to distract herself with the master cleanse - a subconscious revenge on her body for its failure to perform. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>With her sarcastic, dry wit, Becca is often the voice of reason for others, but rarely for herself.</span></p>

<p>After completing forty days and nights of celibacy, <strong>Delia</strong> has manipulated a master plan to get a man to commit to her. She finds solace in positive affirmations, determined to change her mind in order to change her life. But she still can’t get the men she desires to commit to her, to escape men she knows are no good for her, or get the support she wants from her sister, Becca. While Delia is never satisfied with her own life, she's the number one champion of the people she loves.</p>

</div></div>","Detox is a dark comedy digital series about a group of friends whose lives are spinning out of control. Harmony has a million followers online, but her life is a straight up mess. Becca thinks motherhood is her calling, but her uterus just doesn't agree. Delia's positive she's has the formula for the perfect relationship, but the dude isn't calling her back. What's a girl to do when she's not the one in control? Go on a cleanse, of course!
 



We've noticed that GOOPY ideas about health and beauty make the answer to all your problems sound simple.
Not happy with your life? Purge some toxins with a cleanse!
From blogs to billboards, we're being told that quick, easy fixes to our environment or behavior can yield dramatic life-changing results.
Feeling depressed & heavy ? Time to cut out gluten!
Body detoxes and juice cleanses, backed by the glamour of celebrity endorsements, grant us the illusion of control over our lives. 
I drank only juice for 3 days straight and I’VE NEVER FELT BETTER. 
But real life doesn’t work that way...
Real life is messy. And complicated. And sometimes even toxic. (What's a toxin? We don't know for sure. But we know it's bad.) Real life includes eating solid food and making mistakes and apologizing when we've been an asshole (sorry, Mom!)
We've noticed that our idea of detoxing in various forms from juice cleanses to cleaning out our closets is serving a larger purpose than losing weight or having less junk--we've been using it as spiritual purification. Simplify. Cleanse. Start Over. 
Like most people, Harmony, Becca, and Delia are the hardest on themselves. Living up to these unattainable ideas of health, beauty, and an instagram-worthy life is an immense amount of pressure. They're bound to crack at some point...
This is the story of DETOX.
 


When we first set out to create this project, our prompt was for each of us to write and develop a character that we'd never had the opportunity to play.
We realized that most of the female characters we've played have had to be ""likeable.""
That got us thinking: some of our favorite male characters (Tony Soprano, Jesse Pinkman, Don Draper) are grotesque and unlikeable, yet given a lot of leeway to be the flawed complicated characters we love to see.
Why can't female characters be the same way? So we created three women who are a bit offensive and gross, but dynamic, fascinating, bold, and heart-breakingly human. We're telling stories that speak deeply to us as individuals, and hopefully our audience will feel the same.
Harmony

Harmony is on day three of her juice cleanse, sharing the positive results she’s experienced thus far on her YouTube channel. In a flash of Instagram photography, we see what Harmony’s hard-partying reckless life has really involved: dancing on bars, snorting coke in bathrooms, brunching with friends, and passing out at strangers’ houses. Despite not being a writer, she’s landed a book deal based on her growing YouTube subscriber base. She clearly has no idea how to begin writing a book, much less complete one. On a bad day, Harmony is a low-functioning, wanna-be celebrity with a serious drinking problem. On a good day, she’s a fucking riot. Harmony, while being a complete and total mess, brightens up any room she enters with her energy and amazing sense of humor.
 
Becca: Betsy Lippitt


Harmony’s perfectionist sister-in-law, Becca, has always done everything right. Everything she’s wanted, she’s gotten on her timeline: acceptance to a top law school, a great job, a loving marriage. Next up on her timeline is a baby, but she can’t seem to bring a pregnancy to term. Becca avoids expressing her pain to her sister Delia, husband Wes, and even to herself. She opts to distract herself with the master cleanse - a subconscious revenge on her body for its failure to perform. With her sarcastic, dry wit, Becca is often the voice of reason for others, but rarely for herself.


 
Delia: Annie Howard

After completing forty days and nights of celibacy, Delia has manipulated a master plan to get a man to commit to her. She finds solace in positive affirmations, determined to change her mind in order to change her life. But she still can’t get the men she desires to commit to her, to escape men she knows are no good for her, or get the support she wants from her sister, Becca. While Delia is never satisfied with her own life, she's the number one champion of the people she loves.

 

Hi!! We're ​Annie & Betsy - childhood friends, writing partners, and twin souls (according to a local psychic!)
​From the time we were small, we've been fascinated by creating stories together. Our most notable childhood oeuvre was created using the Windows 1995 program 3D Movie Maker. We also loved making DIY spa treatments that grossed everyone out:

We've been kicking around Hollywood the last couple of years, writing projects, acting on tv and workin' day jobs for the man.
We bring the same creative liberation to our collaboration together as filmmakers, writers and actors, as only people who created together as children can.
DETOX is a female-driven narrative that is raw, vulnerable, funny, touching and most importantly, completely relatable. It's vital for us as women writers to continue creating content that is not singularly for women, but for everyone.
By contributing to our campaign you'll be casting your vote for us and for the kind of content that you want to see. With all the WTF?! going on in the world right now, we're pumped with the democracy of crowdfunding. We're looking to you as our collaborators, cheerleaders, and peers. 
 


GOAL: 25K for 3 TEN-MINUTE EPISODES
We have a team of talented, dedicated producers who have helped us to craft a budget that is practical and feasible. We're raising $25,000 to be able to pay for all the equipment rentals, locations, cast & crew members, and production costs. Our snazzy pie chart breaks it all down for you:

Your contribution, regardless of the amount, will be stretched down to the dime. We've got our eagle-eyed producers slashing the budget left and right. Like the hardy New Englanders we are, we'll ""Waste Not, Want Not"" while riding backwards in our banana yellow 1986 Volvo station wagon. 
Once we reach our goal of $25,000, we'll start production!
 


We decided when we began this project that we would create DETOX by any means necessary, so we're gonna scrimp and save and push to make DETOX a reality. To make that happen, we just need the funds hahahahah blah blah blah blha
Whoa. We just had a moment there. It's vulnerable to be sharing this with you.
The real challenge that we're facing is making this happen! That doesn't mean we don't know what we're doing. Annie has professionally produced dozens of digital videos and Betsy has loads of on-set experience. We're confident in our ability to just ""shoot the damn thing.""

<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Kimberly Smith and I am the creator of Heaven’s Adventures. I love the ability to craft a story that inspires my audience to: see, hear, touch, taste and feel God’s love.  </p>
<p>Heaven’s Adventures is a ‘God idea’ that came to me back in 2007, while attending a church service in Arizona. The purpose of the show is to teach young people to be bold about their faith that inspires them to be leaders.</p>
<p>Cartoons are an effective way to grab the attention of children. Our story lines are carefully crafted that engage and inspire action. My team of animators, voice-over talent and others are confident that we will inspire the next generation of young people to reach their God given destinies.</p>
<p>Our mission is to create tomorrow’s leaders. Your contribution will help us accomplish this mission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>Plot: Heaven finds herself in the depths of despair as she is forced to make a decision with life altering consequences. It’s <i>swashbuckling</i> fun for all!</p>
<p>To create this episode and to move the project along in its entirety – We are hoping to raise no less than $30,180</p>
<p>For animation, there is a standard estimation rate of $1000 per minute. This includes: Director, writer(s), voice-over talent, sound designer, character designer(s), rigging artist and the other key people for the animation piece to come together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Therefore, the following budget is listed:</p>
<p>Pilot episode -                                   $11,000</p>
<p>Outstanding balance -                    $2550 (animators, composer, editors, &amp; miscellaneous expenses)</p>
<p>Marketing campaign -                    $8000</p>
<p>Business &amp; Legal fees –                 $2000 - (<i>Business Start-up expenses, Website and other) </i></p>

<p><i>Product creation-                             $2500 (T-shirts; CD’s; posters, adventure pack, DVD's)</i></p>
<p>Administrative/Studio fees -       $1630</p>
<p>Miscellaneous expenses -            $1000</p>
<p>Total expenses:                                $30,180</p>

<p><strong>The Impact – A global message</strong></p>
<p>There is an overwhelming response and anticipation for this project! Especially when shared among parents with school age children. “When, when, when, when”….they all ask.</p>
<p>As a project leader, my formal training includes orchestrating regional conferences, as well as orchestrating my own theatrical productions just to name a few. To further my creative insight and filmmaking skill sets – I have attended several courses held at the Austin School of Film – including Screenwriting and Pre-production management. In addition, I forge relationships with talented people with skill sets beyond my ability that can help me bring about the best product. I operate in fairness and honestly which is why my people trust me as a leader.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>People who know me know that:  a) I’m a risk taken and b) I don’t give up easily. In fact, when I encounter obstacles, I work tirelessly to find ways around those obstacles until I am able to complete the task at hand.</p>
<p> Experience has taught me to seek out people who are passionate about they do and then allow them the space and means to do what they do best. Yet at the same time – set a precedence for high quality work and watch them deliver.</p>
<p>The project was finally birthed in July 2016, as I started meeting various animators. By September, I had various composites done, along with Heaven, her best friend Carlos and several of the other characters for episode one. I also had the theme song completed, but the project has been stalled since October of 2016 until February 2017. Without these characters moving and talking – I have been unable to successfully raise the needed capital to move the project along.</p>
<p>Early February, my team and I held a Table Read and conducted a Video Shoot to capture the sound needed for the animators to draw out the sketches, as well as the video shoot so people can associate a name with a face. These events were needed to help forge the project ahead. We are close to having an animatic trailer of episode one.</p>

<p>We’re a husband and wife team grateful for the opportunity to work with an extremely talented and devoted cast and crew drawn exclusively from the DC/MD/VA market.    With two episodes already ""in the can"" as they say, we plan to begin shooting the rest of the season by late August or early September.   Each episode will explore Adam’s hilarious struggles as he returns to the Baltimore acting scene after twenty-five years away.   But it's not just his story.  As the season progresses you'll meet other characters whose complex, damaged and, in some cases, desperate lives intertwine  with Adam's in a fully realized story arc that, hopefully, will have you anxiously anticipating the release of season two.  In the nearly three decades since Adam left for New York, Baltimore theater has evolved from a handful of small theaters producing revivals of popular works to a vibrant, eclectic community filled with acting companies producing original work written and performed by extremely gifted artists.  One of our goals is to showcase our much- maligned city as a place where dynamic theater thrives.</p>

<p>We hope that after you watch the trailer you'll see that the work we've done so far- even given the limitations of low budget, guerilla filmmaking- is of high quality.  We're operating under a SAG new media agreement so we have access to some really talented actors and the crew is made up of incredibly passionate and hard working people who have been working mostly for pizza.  We'd like to do a full 8 to 10 episode season and could really use your help to get there.  Our hope is to sell the series to an online platform like Netflix or Amazon Prime but if what we end up with is a really cool series that people like you enjoy, share and get excited for the next episode then we know we've done our job. </p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL  YOUR MONEY GO?</strong></p>
<p>The $16,000 figure we've come up with is based on what we've learned from the first two episodes as well as other projects we've worked on over the years.  Yes, filmmaking (or technically, digital filmmaking) has gotten much less expensive in the last few years but still there are costs that can't be avoided and each episode costs a minimum of $2000 to make but the more we can raise, the better!   As creators, we'll take ZERO money and every penny we raise will go directly into making THESPIAN season one the best it can possibly be.   We didn't want to bore you with some arbitrary pie chart thing but here's EXACTLY where your contribution will go:</p>
<p><strong>EQUIPMENT RENTAL</strong>.... Luckily, we have great friends who have contributed not only their time but the really expensive equipment they own. However, sometimes we need to rent things like a shot gun mic, or the right camera for night shoots or an extra lavalier.  The more we raise, the better quality gear we can use to make the series really look and sound great!</p>
<p><strong>LOCATIONS</strong>... Again, we've been fortunate to have the support of friends and family who own a bar or the bookstore we used to shoot the acting class scene in the second episode (thanks Normals Bookstore!) but as we move through the season we're sure someone's gonna want a few bucks to let us use their space.</p>

<p><strong>FOOD</strong>... Probably should've put this one first as it's SO FREAKIN' IMPORTANT!  Our amazing cast and crew work for little or no money but they definitely don't want to starve on set. We've been eating mostly pizzas thus far and that's okay but it would be nice to be able to reward everyone after a tough day of shooting with something besides Dominos or Papa Johns. We don't need lobsters but we just want to make sure everyone has enough snacks and at least one meal for every shoot day.  A happy crew is a productive crew!</p>
<p><strong>POST PRODUCTION SOUND WORK</strong>... While Maria and I do all the editing, titles and color grading, neither one of us can do post sound mix work.  That requires someone who really has the expertise and the ear to make everything sound great.   We know some incredible sound people but it takes many hours to get it right and we want to be able to throw a few bucks their way for the effort.</p>
<p><strong>CREW and CAST PAYROLL</strong>... All the actors have agreed to work for deferred pay, meaning they make money if the project does.  And they're cool with that because as actors we really just want to work and if we believe in the project and the potential rewards, we're happy to climb aboard.  Still, some of the actors come from pretty far away and we'd like to be able to offer some travel money under certain situations.  As for crew, they do the HARD WORK. Actors wait, then someone calls ""action"" and they talk (okay, it's tougher than that but you get the point) while the crew arrives on set way before the actors, work non stop and then break down and load out afterwards.  It's grueling.  They do it because they love it but they definitely deserve something for the back breaking hours they put in.  Your contribution will help us attract the best camera operators, sound recordists, makeup artists, gaffers, etc that Baltimore and the surrounding areas have to offer.</p>
<p><strong>MARKETING</strong>- Hey, if we sell it to Netflix or Amazon Prime or Hulu or even Bob's COOL NEW STREAMING SITE, we may not need to worry about this but odds are, we're going to have spend money getting the word out that we exist.  The cost of a website, marketing materials, festival submission fees, traveling to meetings all fall under this category and we're gonna need it.</p>

In the end, they may be forced to question their own identities.<br/><br/>Each character has made a life choice that put them at odds with their family or community. They have to confront bias against sexual orientation, race, gender identification, or social backgrounds. When a providential inventor presents a time altering opportunity, will they choose to take it… and will it come at a price?</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMX80tLdmE8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>New York is a competitive city where people come from all over the world to find out what they’re made of and fulfill their dreams. By attracting the most diverse people, New York continues to be at the forefront in accepting those who are perceived to be different from society's norm - showing them that they can be accepted, even when their home communities have rejected them.  We want to film this diversity and the bias these characters face as openly as possible and without compromise. A network would require us to stay within their ""family friendly"" guidelines. This is why we want to distribute Psychosis directly online via <strong>Amazon Prime Video</strong> and other platforms in Europe, Latin America and Asia.</p><p>We are asking your help to finance this production.</p><p>To produce a full 12 episode season, in New York City, and under the SAG New Media Agreement, we have figured our total budget to be $260,000.

In the end, they may be forced to question their own identities.Each character has made a life choice that put them at odds with their family or community. They have to confront bias against sexual orientation, race, gender identification, or social backgrounds. When a providential inventor presents a time altering opportunity, will they choose to take it… and will it come at a price?New York is a competitive city where people come from all over the world to find out what they’re made of and fulfill their dreams. By attracting the most diverse people, New York continues to be at the forefront in accepting those who are perceived to be different from society's norm - showing them that they can be accepted, even when their home communities have rejected them.  We want to film this diversity and the bias these characters face as openly as possible and without compromise. A network would require us to stay within their ""family friendly"" guidelines. This is why we want to distribute Psychosis directly online via Amazon Prime Video and other platforms in Europe, Latin America and Asia.We are asking your help to finance this production.To produce a full 12 episode season, in New York City, and under the SAG New Media Agreement, we have figured our total budget to be $260,000. It may look like a lot, but it's actually a lot cheaper than the production of a network TV series.We have gathered an amazing cast of experienced actors who share our enthusiasm for the story and a talented crew to get the polished image and sound we need. They have appeared in many television series, films and Broadway shows that you’re probably already familiar with: Rock of Ages, Motown, The Blacklist, Too Close to Home, The Knick, Divorce, Mozart in the Jungle, The Young and the Restless, Days of Our Lives, Broken at Love, This Just In & DTLA, ...Meet our Cast

Robert believes that America can never have diversity without including the lore of all the different ethnicities, races, orientations, and origins living and represented here. In order to achieve greater inclusion, Robert was inspired to start with the basics - ghost stories, fables, the campfire tale, parables, and riddles - that teach people critical thinking and how to live peaceably with one another in mutual respect and acceptance. These lessons inform children's actions before formal education begins, and continue to influence adults long after test scores have been forgotten.</p><p>Robert created ""The Three Brothers"" with the thought that America’s television audience and those of other continents will embrace a character-driven animated story of universal significance though the setting and specifics may be unfamiliar.</p><p><strong>LIGHTNING YUMEKU</strong></p><p>Lightning Yumeku founded 3 Degrees Films ""3 Degrees,"" an animation production company in New York that creates children’s animation, music videos, and shorts.

Robert’s writing has recently appeared in the anthologies Black Gay Genius, 2014, For Colored Boys Who’ve Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Still Not Enough, 2012 and Voices Rising, 2007.Since 1970, Robert has traveled extensively in Africa. He has visited small villages in North, East, Central and West Africa. He loves the way storytellers weave family histories with major national events to instruct their audiences and how much they respect their listeners. Robert believes that America can never have diversity without including the lore of all the different ethnicities, races, orientations, and origins living and represented here. In order to achieve greater inclusion, Robert was inspired to start with the basics - ghost stories, fables, the campfire tale, parables, and riddles - that teach people critical thinking and how to live peaceably with one another in mutual respect and acceptance. These lessons inform children's actions before formal education begins, and continue to influence adults long after test scores have been forgotten.Robert created ""The Three Brothers"" with the thought that America’s television audience and those of other continents will embrace a character-driven animated story of universal significance though the setting and specifics may be unfamiliar.LIGHTNING YUMEKULightning Yumeku founded 3 Degrees Films ""3 Degrees,"" an animation production company in New York that creates children’s animation, music videos, and shorts. He is a graduate of the School of Visual Arts. Lightning’s vision and spirit aim to bring nothing less than a revolution to the American and New York animation communities and to revitalize and galvanize the immensely talented animation community in NYC. 3 Degrees aims to make animation production, once a staple of the New York film community, a force that bringing jobs, money, and prestige to the city. Lightning Yumeku encourages ways for New Yorkers to co-operate, share ideas and raise awareness of the vibrant cultures around the world through animation. 3 DEGREES FILMS3 Degrees Films is a New York production company using animation techniques to create animated shorts, music videos and children's books.

<h3>The Story:  About REPRESENT</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501829188/t9sxwywka1acfr2aaol1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Ellie and Tess are young, struggling actresses and feminists who regularly face challenges as women in the film industry.  From the pay gap, to nudity in film, to body shaming, to a string of female characters who are defined by their relationship to the male protagonists, they regularly have to choose between accepting roles that misrepresent women, or not working at all.  After a day of particularly trying auditions, Ellie and Tess decide to write and produce their own film:  a multi-genre movie that takes the stereotypes that face each gender in the industry, and flips them around.  <br/><br/>There is a horror scene in which a scantily-clad guy runs through the woods screaming from a masked female killer; a sci-fi romance scene in which a vampire girl tells her human boyfriend that she shouldn't be with him because he's too fragile and breakable; a rom-com bit that includes a ""manic pixie dream dude"".  Tess and Ellie have a lifetime of archetypes to draw from, but there is a problem:  they have never made a movie themselves and have no idea how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>REPRESENT</strong> follows Ellie and Tess as they recruit a cast and crew on a shoestring budget, juggle their day jobs, face resistance, overcome limitations, try to get the male actors to understand the finer points of the feminist content, and do their best to make a difference, no matter how small.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To produce the entire series of <strong>REPRESENT</strong>, we are asking for $5,000.  This money will go to:<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499059081/aepnfhjja2vhmbwjlqcr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Equipment Rental - $1,500</strong><br/>Many of our crew have their own equipment, but there are a few things we are looking to rent, like a boom mic and some additional lighting.</li>
<li>
<strong>Craft Services - $1,300</strong><br/>Food!  Our amazing cast and crew are working on deferred pay, meaning that they only get paid if the series itself makes money.  This is such a <i>major </i>help and we want to repay them with the finest muffins and bagels in all the land.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sound - $1,000</strong><br/>Sound recording and editing are two of the most underrated parts of a film's production.  They take a high level of skill, and we want to be able to hire the best.</li>
<li>
<strong>Location Fees - $200</strong><br/>There are a few locations, like coffee shops and stores, that we will need to ask to film scenes at.  Sometimes the owners allow us free of charge, and sometimes they charge a fee.  We're putting aside some money to allow for that possibility.</li>
<li>
<strong>Props - $200</strong><br/>Most of the costumes will come from the cast's own closets!  But we have a few specialty props we need to purchase, like fake blood (for the fake movie) and some skimpy superhero costumes (for the men, obviously).</li>
<li>
<strong>Music - $300</strong><br/>Some money will go to hiring a composer to create some background music (and possibly a theme song)!</li>
<li>
<strong>Incidentals - $500</strong><br/>In the event that things cost more than we expect - and let's be honest, they usually do - we want to have something set aside for emergencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any excess funds we may receive will be funneled into the ""Incidentals"" section, which means we will be using them for whatever is needed.  And if you <i>really</i> blow us away and give us more than we need to produce the series, everything else will go towards marketing, festival entry fees, and actually paying the amazing people who are working on this project!</p>
<p>But we'd never let you walk away empty-handed!  Everyone who donates at least $5 will get some kind of perk!  Our perks include things like exclusive video content (blooper reels, virtual set tours), signed thank-you notes, <strong>REPRESENT </strong>stickers and T-shirts, invites to the premiere party, Skype sessions with the creator, and even a chance to be IN the webseries!</p>

<h3>The Impact:  Why You Should Support Us</h3>
<p>The struggle is so real for women in film and television, both onscreen and off.  <a href=""http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/geena-davis-study-press-release"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Geena Davis Institute study</a> of film in 11 countries reports that only about 31% of all speaking characters in films are female, and only 23% of films have a female protagonist.  Women are twice as likely to be sexualized as men and five times as likely to be referenced as attractive.  Only about 23% of women are portrayed as having a job of any kind.  Not only that, but off-screen, across the world, women make up only about 20% of filmmaking roles, including directing, writing, and producing.</p>
<p><strong>That.  Is.  Bananas.</strong></p>
<p>Supporting <strong>REPRESENT</strong> is supporting a change in the status quo.  This series follows a diverse group of filmmakers led by diverse, empowered, and complex women.  Each episode faces women's representation in the film industry head on - many based on the real experiences of the cast and crew.</p>
<p>The way women are shown in the media contributes to the way women are treated in real life.  If TV and movies constantly treat women as objects, how can we be surprised when boys do the same?  If girls grow up never seeing the full potential of women onscreen, how can they ever reach theirs?  The goal of <strong>REPRESENT</strong> is to turn all of that on its head.  In this series, women will be at the forefront, questioning everything they've been taught - both in front of and behind the camera.</p>
<p>At the same time, supporting <strong>REPRESENT</strong> means supporting women filmmakers.  Women make up the entire creative team and every major crew position on this series.  In an industry where female hires make up <a href=""https://stephenfollows.com/gender-of-film-crews/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">about 23% of the crew</a>, our majority female crew is both an anomaly and necessary.  Your financial support for <strong>REPRESENT</strong> will allow us more time to work on the project and more opportunities to make it amazing, both of which will elevate our work and allow us the ability to create more.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks and challenges involved in filmmaking.  We've all been on sets where things have gone awry - an actor doesn't show up, a crew member oversleeps, the shots take longer than expected, the location you wanted to use won't let you film there.  And, of course, running out of money is the biggest challenge.  While our cast and crew is phenomenal and we don't anticipate many issues, there's always the chance.</p>
<p>But the truth is, we'll make the series regardless.  The commitment of everyone on the team to make this project on deferred pay proves how much this project means to everyone involved.  If we are fully funded, we will be able to make an incredible, high-quality, funny, empowering, women-led series.  And if we don't get fully funded, we'll take what we <i>do </i>have and make the best series we can.  We hope you'll contribute so that we can make it as great as it can be.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alex Haynes is a Manhattan-born, Midwest-raised actor based in New York City.  He's also… black. Jordy Altman is a Kansan turned Los Angelino. They met in the sixth grade and have spent years on the coasts honing their acting, writing, and producing skills on stage on screen and beyond. They've come together to bring you ""Alex is Black.""</li>
<li> ""Alex Is Black"" is important in the world right now because representation in film and TV matters more than ever. When the world wants to sort us into categories, how do we cope if we don't fit nicely into one specific box? ""Alex is Black"" takes aim at the inherent comedy of being more than one thing; being more than meets the eye in the world as it is today.</li>
<li>Your contribution will help tell these important stories that have not been told before and demonstrate how universally relatable they actually are. Our goal is to reach a wide audience and every contribution, no matter the size, helps nudge us closer to that goal.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our production company, PitLab Production, is looking to raise enough support to cover the production costs for the first season of our web series, ""Alex Is Black."" Your support will help PitLab raise funds toward Pre-Production, Production, Post-Production, and Beyond Production costs, which we have broken down below. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pre: Writing, Revising, Location Scouting, Insurance<br/>Prod: Lighting, Audio, Set Dressing, Wardrobe, Location Services, Craft Services, Equipment Rentals, <br/>Post: Editing, Color Correction, Sound Mixing<br/>Beyond: Festival Submissions</p></li>
<li><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We have exciting perks to share, ranging from social shoutouts to inclusion in front and/or behind the camera! Take a look at our milestones and find the best fit. </span></p></li>
<li><p>If we reach 50% of our goal ($5,000), we will release the 2nd episode of ""Alex Is Black"" for your viewing pleasure! We hope that encourages more of your support as we look to crowdsource the funds for our four remaining episodes. </p></li>
<li><p>If we don't reach our goal, we will use whatever we have raised to bring to life as many episodes as we can. We are determined to bring season 1 of ""Alex is Black"" to life, and we will do as much as possible with what we've got. </p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Everyone has defining characteristics that aren't visible. Traits that make us who we are that are only apparent to the world when we make them so. It's important to come together over stories about our differences because those differences are what make us the same.</li>
<li>Jordy Altman, co-founder of PitLab Productions, is an Emmy-Award winning Producer on CBS' ""The Talk."" He is taking his talents from the live studio to the small studio with PitLab Productions. Before taking on ""Alex Is Black,"" PitLab recently wrapped the first season of ""Pillow Talk,"" a web series written and starring Aubree Bowen. </li>
<li>Alex Haynes is an accomplished actor, performing in the record-breaking ""Puffs…"" Off-Broadway. Alex has also performed multiple roles at The Flea Theater including being directed by noted filmmaker Joel Schumacher. His voice can be heard as Talonflame (and many others) in <i>Pokemon X, Y &amp; Z</i> currently streaming on Netflix. All this and more can be found at alex-haynes.com.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Production can be daunting, but with your support we can overcome the fiscal and physical hurdles that await us.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Combined, PitLab Production has been producing short-form content for over 10 years in the industry, from broadcast segments, commercials, online sketches, webseries, and much more… </li>
<li>PitLab recently helped fundraise $2,000 for ""Pillow Talk."" </li>
<li>Our budget has already been devised, and each episode will cost roughly $2,500 split between Pre-production, Production, and Post costs.</li>
<li>Each aspect of production is an item on a checklist. We work on each item until the list is complete. As challenges arise we pivot and problem-solve until the issue is resolved. Relying on each other and our extended network of talented artists for advice and guidance. We funded the first two episodes ourselves because we believed in our ability to rise above inevitable obstacles enough to risk our own resources.</li>

Short Summary

Alex Haynes is a Manhattan-born, Midwest-raised actor based in New York City.  He's also… black. Jordy Altman is a Kansan turned Los Angelino. They met in the sixth grade and have spent years on the coasts honing their acting, writing, and producing skills on stage on screen and beyond. They've come together to bring you ""Alex is Black.""
 ""Alex Is Black"" is important in the world right now because representation in film and TV matters more than ever. When the world wants to sort us into categories, how do we cope if we don't fit nicely into one specific box? ""Alex is Black"" takes aim at the inherent comedy of being more than one thing; being more than meets the eye in the world as it is today.
Your contribution will help tell these important stories that have not been told before and demonstrate how universally relatable they actually are. Our goal is to reach a wide audience and every contribution, no matter the size, helps nudge us closer to that goal.


What We Need & What You Get
Our production company, PitLab Production, is looking to raise enough support to cover the production costs for the first season of our web series, ""Alex Is Black."" Your support will help PitLab raise funds toward Pre-Production, Production, Post-Production, and Beyond Production costs, which we have broken down below. 

Pre: Writing, Revising, Location Scouting, InsuranceProd: Lighting, Audio, Set Dressing, Wardrobe, Location Services, Craft Services, Equipment Rentals, Post: Editing, Color Correction, Sound MixingBeyond: Festival Submissions
We have exciting perks to share, ranging from social shoutouts to inclusion in front and/or behind the camera! Take a look at our milestones and find the best fit. 
If we reach 50% of our goal ($5,000), we will release the 2nd episode of ""Alex Is Black"" for your viewing pleasure! We hope that encourages more of your support as we look to crowdsource the funds for our four remaining episodes. 
If we don't reach our goal, we will use whatever we have raised to bring to life as many episodes as we can. We are determined to bring season 1 of ""Alex is Black"" to life, and we will do as much as possible with what we've got. 


The Impact

Everyone has defining characteristics that aren't visible. Traits that make us who we are that are only apparent to the world when we make them so. It's important to come together over stories about our differences because those differences are what make us the same.
Jordy Altman, co-founder of PitLab Productions, is an Emmy-Award winning Producer on CBS' ""The Talk."" He is taking his talents from the live studio to the small studio with PitLab Productions. Before taking on ""Alex Is Black,"" PitLab recently wrapped the first season of ""Pillow Talk,"" a web series written and starring Aubree Bowen. 
Alex Haynes is an accomplished actor, performing in the record-breaking ""Puffs…"" Off-Broadway. Alex has also performed multiple roles at The Flea Theater including being directed by noted filmmaker Joel Schumacher. His voice can be heard as Talonflame (and many others) in Pokemon X, Y & Z currently streaming on Netflix. All this and more can be found at alex-haynes.com.


Risks & Challenges
Production can be daunting, but with your support we can overcome the fiscal and physical hurdles that await us.  

Combined, PitLab Production has been producing short-form content for over 10 years in the industry, from broadcast segments, commercials, online sketches, webseries, and much more… 
PitLab recently helped fundraise $2,000 for ""Pillow Talk."" 
Our budget has already been devised, and each episode will cost roughly $2,500 split between Pre-production, Production, and Post costs.
Each aspect of production is an item on a checklist. We work on each item until the list is complete. As challenges arise we pivot and problem-solve until the issue is resolved. Relying on each other and our extended network of talented artists for advice and guidance. We funded the first two episodes ourselves because we believed in our ability to rise above inevitable obstacles enough to risk our own resources.

This is the story of a woman who finds herself in the throws of the underworld...Our cast and crew have won at Sundance (Jack Mulcahy: Brother’s McMullen), acted in Oscar nominated films (Emma Sara: Incendie), graced the Broadway Stage (Matty Oaks: ""Angles in America"", David Sitler Frost/Nixon), worked directly with ARNOLD (Brett Azar: Terminator Genysis) and appeared in blockbuster network shows such as Blue Bloods, Sex and the City, Law and Order, Black List, Girls, Gone, Veep, Evil Lives Here, and Homicide:Life on the Street. ​With this kind of experience and talent, there is no fight we will lose! Given the talent and dedication to this project, everyone is getting paid for the work they put in.  As a struggling actor, I have participated in MANY projects where I was simply given a slice of pizza and a credit and spent my own money on any other expenses. I do not want to be that kind of project! Our actors are professional and will be PAID for their commitment and the work they put into every passing moment in front of the camera. We want the end product to be QUALITY. With that, gear rental and top notch editing is a necessity. We are making something big and we are not looking back.",30.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>We are Chioma NKachukwu (Nigerian)... and Ramata Doray (Angolan).</p>
<p>Coincidentally we both moved to the United States at the same year and at the same age of 15 years old.... However we did not meet until 4 years later in college.</p>
<p>What we are not: Avid travelers with all the answers, History buffs (Although chioma has a serious soft spot for history) and Know it all (We are just a little bit less clueless than the rest and a lot more passionate). </p>
<p>Growing up, our history individually was marred by domination and hardly ever covered, touched or explored as if we had none. A brief recourse of the scramble and conquering of Africa, and we are always quickly ushered into our colonizers history. Hence, how most educated people know European history more than their own history (Ourselves included) and the none educated are generally clueless. So in away, we are all African Illiterates.... Educated or not.</p>
<p><strong>CHIOMA'S PERSPECTIVE: </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550365021/uqpsrl9xb04yvtxkne9g.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>I picked up a love for History from my father... We all did, and the little I know of Africa (more than most people) I learn't from my father who rather than read you a story book for bed, read us books like (Nkurumah the man).  </p>
<p>However, I still had no idea, that the information I had was just a word from pages of histories that no one has explored. You would think, that history in African Elite schools would cover even a chapter of the African history...</p>
<p>Moving here as a teenager did not make things better. On the contrary, I further got immersed into western and European history, where the History of Blackness was only describe in chapters dedicated to Slavery, as if that was where we began. </p>
<p>Still... I did not realize something was missing. </p>
<p>It is odd, that fellow native Africans like myself here in Diaspora and those back at home do not still realize we are missing large in the pages of prominent existence and history, or we do not care... May be I hadn't realized it was missing because everyone (majority) looked like me, and while I was inhaling European history I didn't realize that was the only one to indulge in. It was relocating to a difference country, that brought my awareness, that my representation is missing.</p>
<p>I was new in college when as classmate, burst through the doors, ecstatic and proudly announced (Egypt has a black Pharaoh) and an argument ensuing, on if Egypt was even a part of Africa, that one bolt loosened.  I was in High School when I got questions regarding living in huts and riding lions to school ( That was when the first awareness bolt got loose). I was in high school when my counselor a man of nearly 70 deemed it fit to ask me how we communicated and emigrated. (My answer... When we want to migrate, some of us, grown wings and fly, Some since we are archaic human being retained some use of Gills, so they swim and yes I had a pet lion named Simba).</p>
<p>Sarcasm... I know, but that was how I dealt with questions I felt deep down inside that people with information at the tip of their fingers should have.</p>
<p>We haven't made much progress, cause African History is only covered in phases of Egyptian history (And even at that, the representation is sometimes wrong). African existence is often covered in the genocidal striping of human resources (Slavery). And when ever something remotely authentic seems to be rearing its head The poverty state of the continent becomes a topic that covers our very existence and the lives of our ancestors as if they were never once here and prosperous. </p>
<p>We haven't made much progress, because while people realize Africa has potential, or know that we don't all live in huts or own lions or are all poor and need a dollar to survive. [ Side Note: I do need your dollar this time around :) but I digress. ] They mostly know a prosperous Africa from the Safari end of it. There is absolutely no tangible knowledge about the continent. </p>
<p>There is no exploration of our culture rather, there is exploitation. </p>
<p>AND .... Africans ourselves are as oblivious of our own resources, history, diversity, similarities hence we keep allowing our destabilization. </p>
<p>There is an old proverb (He who does not know where and when it started raining on him, will not know where and when it stops) . (If you are clueless of your own existence, then you are clueless you are being stolen from). </p>
<p>If we do not know our own history how can we, right our future?  How can we know the value and Heritage we have? </p>
<p>Our Goal, Is not to bore you, with boring history lessons</p>
<p>Our goal is to educate people, Africans and the world about Africa as it was, has been, is and will possibly be. To show Africa in its authentic voice, without bureaucracy, and assumptions.</p>
<p>This will be done through creating a Network for travelers to experience the people and its culture and learn History without even intending to.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself, sitting in a family compound with an old matriarch or patriarch, with children and grand children and yourself, surrounding a crackling fire, Traditional food served, as everyone eats and listen to folklores tied into history of each region being told by the old one. </p>
<p>We are trying to create a circuit, where people experience authentic experiences, learn new things and meet the people as people. Rather than just the people as your nice tour guide. </p>
<p>Could you imagine having a Night off season harvest, with burning palm fronds walking in farms at midnight with the villagers, can you imagine, being invited to a traditional wedding, to witness the traditional rites as its done to see the difference between that and the west and learn why it is done that way? </p>
<p>Can you imagine your self, frolicking in the dance festivals just like a local or experiencing Christmas like you have never experienced before...?</p>

<p>Just as mentioned above. I had childhood where my history was non existent. And the focus was mostly on the colonization of Angola by the Portuguese. </p>
<p>Chioma likes to accuse that Angola took a little too much to its colonization. and while I partially disagree, It is not too far reaching and argument, considering we lost our hold on our native language. Myself included.</p>
<p>Another point of contention i had with chioma (As you will see, through our travel vlogs.. we tend to have a lot of point of contentions) was her absolute unwavering love for European History; while i curtailed my intake, on the revolting point that often I am not represented in those. I am not included in those pages or screens. </p>
<p>We are hardly ever represented culturally on world stages, we have interesting, intriguing heroes and stories to tell  Example: Queen Nzinga Mbande  african queen who fought fearlessly and cleverly for the freedom and stature of her kingdom against the Portuguese, who were colonizing the remaining of Angola at the time.By her own determination and refusal to give in to the Portuguese without a flight she transformed her kingdom into a formidable commercial state on equal footing with the Portuguese colonies. I want to bring more of those stories to light. We are not just a history of being conquereed, of being exploited and we are not all a culture of one trick ponies.... there is much more to us, from the past to the present and that is why we want to show you African through rose colored glasses.</p>
<h3>We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our general intention is not only to educate people about African history, but to promote exploration and enjoyment of African culture through travel and interaction. It is a lot of hard work and a serious labor of love, contacting village chiefs and stewards to discuss permissions and what is possible. He have barely scratched the surface as you can see from the Map below, that Africa is an incredibly complicated and Large landmark and diversity. But the little response we have received has been amazingly overwhelmingly exciting and we cant wait to fully get going . And you can definitely help us reach that goal.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone, it's the New Year, and we are back! Kenny From the Jump has returned!  We are here because we need to complete the 1st season by completing the last two episodes.  We would like to say thank you to everyone who contributed last time!  The last round help us cover the majority of the production costs; (shoutout to Safari restaurant and Faded Needles for allowing us to use their establishments as locations), Kenny from the Jump has received a lot of attention and is attracting an audience that is asking for more. We are so glad to have received that feedback, and we would like to ask for more contributions to continue the series onward and upwards. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get   </h3>
<p>We'll need to raise $6,000 with your help!</p>
<p>Here are how the contributions will be used: </p>
<p>-Hire professional editors and color graders to make the episodes look as clean as possible.  </p>
<p>-Locations for 2 scenes left in the series.  We rely on local businesses for our locations,  therefore we are required to pay them because they will have to cease operations while we film.    </p>
<p>-Sound recorder/ sound engineer: Most good productions can be undone with bad sound.   </p>
<p>-Transportation:  Since we are using different locations, we'll need adequate transportation for talent, crew, and equipment.    </p>
<p>-Craft services: We have to feed people! 2</p>
<p>-Opening credits sequence for the show: Every good show needs an opening credits sequence. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The series is a great opportunity to showcase my writing and directing skills.  As we have been shooting and making this web series, we have had the opportunity to bring up and collaborate with newer actors and talent in the industry.  We have also had the great opportunity to work with local businesses and local communities, which give them opportunities to promote what they do and how they do it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Many things can go wrong in the course of shooting a TV series: </p>
<p>- Weather:  Sometimes, as much as one may plan for certain conditions, mother nature may have different plans in store for you, which can in turn slow down production, and have financial consequences.    </p>
<p>- Coordinating everyone's schedules: Many of the people we work with usually have other projects that they have lined up, which is part of the nature of freelance work.  This can also impact production costs, as sometimes due to schedule conflict, we'll have to pay more to substitute a crew member out last minute.    </p>
<p>-Understaffing: It is hard to find the right amount of people to help out with production and on-set duties.  I want to make sure I have enough funds in order to ensure that I have enough people on set to where I can focus on working with the talent.      </p>
<p>-Broken Equipment:  As much as we want things on set to go smoothly, sometimes it cannot be helped and equipment may malfunction or break, which is something that the funds raised will help cover production insurance. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that everyone we reach out to may not be able to contribute money, however there are other ways you can help:   </p>
<p>-Spread the word to your friends, family, and strangers even if you are an exceptionally social personality!  </p>
<p>-If you live in the New York City area, you can volunteer to help out on the set as a Production Assistant! You'll even have your name in the credits.    </p>
<p>-If you know someone else that would be interested in donating to this campaign, send the campaign link their way, and they will receive producer credits for the show. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Steve Becker and I am the lead creator of the web series <strong>Brazzy Jazzy. </strong>I won't bore you with the details of my life (that's what the video is for), but I will bare my soul as to why I created this show. I have been involved with stand-up comedy &amp; filmmaking for more than 20 years. I have also been travelling to Brazil for more than 20 years (watch the video for why). What better way to combine all of my talents and experiences gained over the last 20 years than to create a show about a Brazilian Girl coming to NYC to become a fashion designer. Granted, I know almost nothing about fashion, but my Brazilian wife does (I have the credit card receipts to prove it). Plus, she knows what it's like to come to NYC and survive our cold winters, strange language, and even stranger culture.  Much as I had to survive Brazil's hot weather (ok not such a hardship), strange language, and super strange culture (you have to see to believe it).</p>
<p>There have been many twists and turns on this multicultural journey to elusive television success. We have shot 2 teaser reels, a full TV Pilot, a 2nd TV Pilot, and finally, the first 60 minutes of the series. What's worth doing is worth doing right (Shakespeare??). But, finally, we have a nearly finished product we are happy with and believe you will be happy with as well. The goal is to show how ambition, intellect, &amp; talent are often not enough to overcome culture differences, language barriers, and extreme weather (I was not bred to be an Amazonian). However, the overriding hope of ours was to show these cultural and geographical challenges in a non-stereotypical but hopefully funny way.You will be the final judge on that one.</p>
<p>As part of this Indiegogo campaign, we are launching the first episode of Brazzy Jazzy. The link  is right here. <strong>It's officially BRAZZY JAZZY TIME!!</strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGmV1dc8zbQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The rest of the 13 episodes will be released in July. But to keep you all tingly with excitement, we have attached the Teaser reel for the entire first season. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBO4wKQRONU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>And if that wasn;t enough, we have the full breakdown of all the characters and plot lines as well as bios on all the actors and creative team on our website: <a href=""http://www.BrazzyJazzy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.BrazzyJazzy.com</a></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I created this show to demonstrate to the American Audience the passion Brazilians bring to life in NYC as well as the challenges faced by all, especially immigrants, striving for the American dream. I like to believe that I have a unique understanding and connection with Brazil - My mother was a professor of Brazilian Studies at Brown, I lived in Brazil off &amp; on the last 20 years, my wife is Brazilian, I am an acai addict (who isn't?).</p>
<p>After running my own business successfully for years, I have had the opportunity to travel the world extensively. As much as I have tried to instantly acclimate to foreign cultures, I have often felt like the classic fish out of water. Given my comedy background and life experiences,  I feel I can depict the cultural outsider in comic situations with hopefully witty insight.</p>
<p>Shockingly, there are no shows about Brazilian-America life on TV or how their culture differs greatly from the more media saturated Hispanic experience. <strong>That is until now!</strong></p>
<p>So please watch the show and don't be shy about offering your opinion. All points of view are welcome and I hope the show provokes a healthy, civil debate about Brazilians in the USA.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In making this show, we the creators have already invested $50,000 of our own money. That's how passionately we believe in this project. We are looking to raise $25,000 to finish the editing of Season 1 while investing heavily in the marketing of the series.  All funds raised will go directly to production and post production expenses.  Any monies raised above our goal will go towards the production of season 2 which has already been written.</p>
<p>To help you feel like you are getting something substantial for your contribution (besides your enjoyment of watching the show) we have created some unique and exciting perks.</p>
<p>My wife Zuzu's NYC skin care spa is one of the sponsors of the series. She is offering various treatments for free (sorry, ladies only) with your $200 or $300 donation. These include a revitalizing lymphatic massage or the ever popular Velashape cellulite reduction treatment. Check out <a href=""http://www.SpaZuzu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.SpaZuzu.com</a> for more details. Plus we have our other Spa  (Bellastetica) in Rio for those Brazilians needing some skin rejuvenation.</p>
<p>For your $75 donation, you get to choose one snazzy Brazzy Jazzy T-shirt that depicts an iconic scene or saying from the show. They come in 3 colors and 3 styles. For $100, you get a coffee mug set with the same iconic scenes and sayings from the show.</p>
<p>For our business community, we offer 3 types of branded sponsorship similar to SpaZuzu's motion graphic in front of episode 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>A 5 second motion graphic before an episode with the ""Sponsored by"" designation</li>
<li>A 5 second motion graphic after an episode with the ""Sponsored by"" designation</li>
<li>Displaying your logo at the end of the episode with a ""Additional sponsored by"" designation.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have some other unique perks (dinner with the cast, signed poster, designer outfits from the show, a speaking part in Season 2) for other contribution levels which you can check out to our right. All in all, we want you to feel part of the team and for the experience to be memorable. T-Shirts, mugs, and magnets are forever, right?</p>

<h3>Introdução</h3>
<p>Meu nome é Steve Becker e eu sou o principal criador da série da web Brazzy Jazzy. Eu não vou te entediar com os detalhes da minha vida (é para isso que serve o vídeo), mas vou mostrar minha alma a respeito de porque eu criei esse show. Eu estive envolvido com comédia stand-up e cinema há mais de 20 anos. Também viajo para o Brasil há mais de 20 anos (assista ao vídeo). Que melhor maneira de combinar todos os meus talentos e experiências adquiridos ao longo dos últimos 20 anos do que criar um show sobre uma menina brasileira que vem para a NYC para se tornar uma designer de moda. Concedido, eu não sei quase nada sobre moda, mas minha esposa brasileira faz (eu tenho os recibos de cartão de crédito para provar isso). Além disso, ela sabe o que é vir a NYC e sobreviver os invernos frios, a uma língua estranha e a uma cultura ainda mais estranha. Tanto quanto eu tive que sobreviver ao tempo quente do Brasil (ok, não é uma dificuldade), uma língua estranha e uma cultura super estranha (você tem que ver para acreditar).</p>
<p>Houve muitas reviravoltas nesta jornada multicultural para o evasivo sucesso televisivo. Nós filmamos dois teaser reels, um piloto de TV completo, um segundo piloto de TV e, finalmente, os primeiros 60 minutos da série. Vale a pena fazer o que vale a pena fazer certo (Shakespeare ??). Mas, finalmente, temos um produto quase acabado que estamos felizes e acreditamos que você também ficará feliz. O objetivo é mostrar como ambição, intelecto e talento muitas vezes não são suficientes para superar diferenças culturais, barreiras linguísticas e condições climáticas extremas (eu não fui criado para ser um amazonense). No entanto, a nossa maior esperança era mostrar esses desafios culturais e geográficos de uma maneira não estereotipada, mas esperançosamente engraçada. Você será o juiz final sobre isso. Como parte dessa campanha do Indiegogo, estamos lançando o primeiro episódio de Brazzy Jazzy. O link está acima. É oficialmente BRAZZY JAZZY TIME !!</p>
<div>O restante dos 13 episódios será lançado em julho. Mas para mantê-lo todo contagiante de emoção, nós anexamos o Teaser Reel durante toda a primeira temporada. E se isso não bastasse, temos o colapso completo de todos os personagens e enredos, bem como bios em todos os atores e equipe criativa em nosso site: <a href=""http://www.BrazzyJazzy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.BrazzyJazzy.com</a>

<h3>O IMPACTO</h3>
<p>Eu criei este show para demonstrar à American Audience a paixão que os brasileiros trazem à vida em Nova York, bem como os desafios enfrentados por todos, especialmente os imigrantes, lutando pelo sonho americano. Eu gosto de acreditar que tenho uma compreensão e uma conexão únicas com o Brasil - Minha mãe foi professora de estudos brasileiros na Brown, morei no Brasil e nos últimos 20 anos, minha esposa é brasileira, sou viciada em açaí, etc . Tive a sorte de ter viajado pelo mundo depois de administrar meu próprio negócio com sucesso por anos. Por mais que eu tenha tentado me aclimatar instantaneamente a culturas estrangeiras, muitas vezes me senti como o peixe clássico fora d'água. Dada a minha experiência de comédia e experiências de vida, sinto que posso descrever o outsider cultural em situações cômicas com uma visão esperançosa e espirituosa. De maneira chocante, não há programas sobre a vida da América Latina na TV ou como sua cultura difere muito da experiência hispânica mais saturada pela mídia. Isso é até agora! Então, por favor, assista o show e não tenha vergonha de oferecer sua opinião. Todos os pontos de vista são bem-vindos e espero que o programa provoque um saudável debate civil sobre brasileiros nos EUA.</p>
<h3>O que precisamos e o que você recebe</h3>
<p>Ao fazer esse show, nós, os criadores, já investimos US $ 50.000 do nosso próprio dinheiro. É assim que apaixonadamente acreditamos neste projeto. Queremos arrecadar US $ 25.000 para terminar a edição da 1ª temporada enquanto investimos pesado no marketing da série. Todos os fundos levantados irão diretamente para as despesas de produção e pós-produção. Qualquer quantia levantada acima do nosso objetivo irá para a produção da segunda temporada que já foi escrita. Para ajudá-lo a sentir que está recebendo algo substancial por sua contribuição (além do prazer de assistir ao programa), criamos algumas vantagens únicas e empolgantes.</p>
<p>O spa da minha esposa Zuzu em NYC é um dos patrocinadores da série. Ela está oferecendo vários tratamentos gratuitamente (desculpem, somente mulheres) com sua doação de US $200 ou US $300.

Além disso, temos o nosso outro Spa (Bella Estetica) no Rio para aqueles brasileiros que precisam de algum rejuvenescimento da pele.</p>
<p>Para sua doação de US $ 75, temos as elegantes camisetas Jazzy Brazzy que retratam cenas icônicas do show. Eles vêm em 3 cores e 3 estilos.</p>
<p>Por US $ 100, você ganha um conjunto de 4 canecas de café com as mesmas cenas icônicas e dizendo a partir do show.</p>
<p>Para nossa comunidade de negócios, oferecemos três tipos de patrocínio de marca semelhantes ao gráfico animado do SpaZuzu na frente do episódio 1.</p>
<ul>

<p>Também temos algumas outras vantagens exclusivas (jantar com o elenco, pôster assinado, roupas de designer do show, falando na segunda temporada) para outros níveis de contribuição que você pode conferir à nossa direita.</p>
<p>Em suma, queremos que você se sinta parte da equipe e que a experiência seja memorável. T-shirts, canecas e ímãs são para sempre, certo?</p>

It provides the framework for dramatizing the public human enhancement debate. In 2016 the Transhumanist Party fielded a candidate for President of the United States, generating little more than novelty attraction from counterculture internet surfers. In 2055, the issues surrounding Automation and Artificial Intelligence, Genetic and human-computer augmentation and their impact on the economy of existence for the vast working class is in full relief. Louise Zalazar, is a leading candidate for governor and a firm believer in transhumanism as a social responsibility.</p><p><strong>Race for Enhancements</strong> (The Resourceful Answer)<br/>This story is about the hope of regular people and their efforts to get beyond the struggles of everyday life; people smart enough to know something better is available, but not connected to the upper echelons of privilege that provides access; these are the resourceful people. The aspirations of Jasmine Wilson, former soldier,  and her star high school athlete son, Trey, will carry this story. Jasmine knows that “exceptional” is the new normal and is determined to see her son succeed. Where there are possibilities there is hope.</p><p><strong>Race for the Next Iteration</strong> (The 1% Reality)<br/>This is the geopolitical story that frames the Clark's quest to ""Manufacturer Competitiveness"" that will usher in a world-wide balance of power. Their efforts are focused on People, Places and Productivity: they are constantly on the look-out for ""their kind of people"" to enhance; their Smart City endeavor is the Place, the Shangri-la of innovation; and the innovations from their company, Bio-patch, that provide the Productivity driving their dreams, with only Maggie’s humanitarian instincts and whip smart technological insight providing a contentious check on David’s maniacal competitiveness.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561053505/vlwsuhnhwjkabojtiptz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>Principle Characters</strong></h3><p><strong>Dr. Rachel Margaret “Maggie” Clark</strong> is a Neurobiologist. She started her career at the Defense Agency Research Project Agency (DARPA) specializing in the interface between the brain and computers, mind-uploading, and genetic cognitive augmentation. Maggie was among the first generation of people receiving genetic cognitive enhancements. Her scientist father died in a suspicious accident when she was 14 years old and she and her mother fell out of the rarefied world his career afforded them. This exposed Maggie to a different way of life, and she saw first-hand how the advances in technology and genetics were being coveted by the wealthy and elite, and were not trickling down to regular people.</p><p><strong>Dr. David Clark</strong>, a Cognitive Neuroscientist and Geneticist, and former star researcher at the United States government’s top secret research agency, the Defense Agency Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is driven by a desire to rebuild society. He spent time in an exchange program with the Chinese equivalent of DARPA, the National Basic Research  Program, and came away impressed with how far along China was in “engineering genius”, and quietly committed himself to a similar pursuit among “his kind” of people to close a gap that was widening at an accelerated pace due to selective distribution of enhancement technologies. He is madly in love with Maggie, the only thing that seems to temper his competitiveness.</p><p><strong>Jasmine Wilson</strong>. 38. Religious, clever, strong, former U.S. Army soldier who fought in the ISIS War in 2025, where she lost her husband to a classified mission, and she will stop at nothing to protect her child (Trey). Served under William Russell.</p><p><strong>Terrance James “Trey” Wilson III</strong> 16, a very serious student and extraordinary athlete. Not fully aware of the level of human enhancement necessary to go to the next level. Hot headed, wants it all now, has hero syndrome compensating for not knowing his father.</p><p><strong>Sven Galesman</strong>, 62 (103), former MIT Molecular Biologist, preeminent genetic researcher, Professor of Biology and Bioengineering at the Karolinska Institute, Sweden, a leading member of an international community of bio-hackers committed to keeping the pathways to evolutionary enlightenment open to the commons. Sven is a member of the Polar Bear club and a former freestyle mountain climber.</p><p><strong>Dr. Robert “Bob” Sinclair,</strong> 75 one of the first to experiment with the telomere chromosome, he earned his Ph.D. in Molecular and Population Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1960s. Formerly, Director of Technology Development at the Department of Health and Human Services, keeps company with a cabal of right-wing fanatics that shuffle in and out of government and industry. Sinclair is convinced that without the strong, forceful guidance from the government private partnerships he represents through his current employer, Globalgene, the transformative nature of the emerging technologies could be used by any number of groups and governments to challenge Western dominance. Loves old Robert Deniro movies.</p><p><strong>Dr. Chu Ng</strong>, 34 (76) billionaire real estate developer and Chinese national, educated at the prestigious Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China, which implies ties to the upper levels of the Chinese government and possibly its intelligence services. While Prof. Chu's complete history is a bit of a fog, there is evidence linking him to the work of Teuvo Kohonen, a pioneer of neural networks over 100 years ago that was at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning and robotics. While his work with David Clark is driven also by a strong belief in the human spirit of competition and right to pursue a good life, Prof. Chu is a realist and a loyal Chinese National.</p><p><strong>Betty Roy</strong> -- 38, former hacker-for-hire, turned federal informant, turned federal agent. Liz was the fall-girl for a much larger conspiracy, knowledge of which she managed to leverage into a job rather than the orange jumpsuits her hacker friends were donning on an unmarked ship to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Duplicitous, could be working both sides.</p><p><strong>Ikemba Okafor</strong>, 49 (97), The governor’s state of Bayelsa is perfectly positioned for access to land, sea and air, has a stable and prosperous middle-class and a first rate research university. The governor has distinguished himself amongst his colleagues because of his accomplishments in attracting money and talent with his plans of turning Baylesha into a smart-city, complete with its own power grid, satellite network and plans for an aerospace program. As a young medical student and son of a prominent Nigerian businessman, Gov. Okafor was with the Chinese when they were doing advanced telomere research and testing.</p><p><strong>Louise Zalzar</strong>: State Senator from Hamilton Heights in her early 40s. Married with three children. Idealistic but not naïve. A player in state politics for the past 10 years. A standard bearer of progressive politics (increase in UBI/social benefits, the Biogenetic Personal Freedom Act, and repeal of the Redundancy Act) and just outspoken enough to have run a foul party bosses on both sides of the aisle but is prime to be the next governor with even bigger aspirations. </p><p><strong>Theresa (Russell) Lucas</strong>: Captain in US Army Reserve and an admitted daddy’s girl. She was happy to follow in his footsteps of military service. For the happily married, mother of three, losing her mother to cancer was a major blow but to see her father do the unthinkable, “surrender” and in such a way is devastating to her and her family. </p><p><strong>William Russell</strong>: Retired after 30 plus years in the Army, having graduated from West Point, saw action in locations around the world for 20 years.  After retirement, Russell to his surprise and dismay, was unable to find any work above menial janitorial and or push-button work, which wasn’t an extreme problem until his wife was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. After watching his beloved wife deteriorate before his eyes, Russell had hit an emotional bottom that was compounded by rising mounting medical debt and ever present cutbacks in government and post military benefits. Russell is convinced that he’s doing the right and noble thing for the many suffering from similar circumstances.</p><p><strong>SEASON 1:</strong> Episodic Breakdown</p><p><strong>REDUNDANCY</strong></p><p>Clock is ticking waiting for Supreme Court decision that could usher in new era of Assisted Suicide, expanding the definition of Terminally Disabled to include Terminal Redundancy. William Russell, 52 year old former Marine, has kicked off this maelstrom with his request to die.  Drs. Maggie and David Clark are part of an international network that is at the center of the debate about human redundancy in the age of smart machines. The efforts to broaden availability of human enhancement tech is also at center stage in the hotly contested governor's race of Louise Zalazar.</p><p><strong>TRYING TO GET ON</strong></p><p>Louise Zalazar, a committed Transhumanist, has suddenly got the attention of the National Security apparatus. Dr. Robert Sinclair, intelligence officer for the high-tech defense contractor, Globalgene, continues to mislead the public about enhancements. Jasmine Wilson, former soldier, fears for her own son's future and is desperate to learn more about advanced enhancements. Maggie is preparing to pitch the owner of a portfolio of sports franchises for the contract to provide sanctioned enhancement therapies to his teams.</p><p><strong>MAINTAINING RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p>Dr. Chu comes to Clark’s for risky memory implantation procedure to replace recent memory of government agent, Betty Roy. Maggie opposed, David reluctantly contacts ace neurosurgeon, Sven Galesmen, to perform risky virtual surgery. Trey Wilson and his mom Janice continue their pursuit of advanced enhancements, while the smart city deal gets a boost from the Chinese.</p><p><strong>STUFF HAPPENS</strong></p><p>Bio-patch malfunction causes Zalazar’s partner to go into temporary coma, causing political and media uproar. Globalgene instigated Congressional hearings trying to shut down competing enhancements. Rev. Thomas learns information that could jeopardize his relationship with Jasmine. African Smart-city partner threatens to replace BioPatch. David is preparing to testify at a Congressional hearing on pending legislation that could cripple Biopatch’s latest research.</p><p><strong>RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION</strong></p><p>We learn about the Biopatch Experimental Group, apostles of the Biopatch network. BEG began when David and Maggie were in an exchange program at the Chinese National Research Group, where they met Ikemba Okafor’s father, former regional governor in Nigeria, and a biotechnology evangelist with whom David and Maggie started the secret embro enhancement project.</p><p><strong>EUREKA, WE DID IT!</strong></p><p>Biopatch Research produces programmable biological computer that uses genetic material to program functions into living cells, big advance beyond simply reading electrocardiographic signals and stimulating electrochemical signals. The implications are huge and the Corporatocracy is agitated.</p><p><strong>STAKES ARE TOO HIGH</strong></p><p>Maggie and David’s reconcile their beef over the activities of the network as she boards a plane to attend the official opening ceremony for the Nigerian Smart City Project.</p><p><strong>POLITICS AND STRANGE BEDFELLOWS</strong></p><p>As the campaign winds to a close, it has become a referendum on enhancements, with the Luddites vehemently opposed, the Middle-class demanding broader access, the Elite trying to maintain monopoly and control, a battle that will continue into the second and third seasons as David and Maggie Clark continue to challenge the Corporatocracy through pursuit of their ambitious goals.</p><h3><strong>Production</strong></h3><p>The near-future time-frame provides us with the flexibility to create a minimalist futuristic setting without drastically re-imaging the landscape. This is a character driven drama, with the mood and feel of an  “X-files” adventure in pursuit of a “Wakanda-like” world.</p><p><strong>Virtual Set Production</strong></p><p>We intend to shoot the series using the on-set, real-time rendering capabilities of the Unreal Gaming Engine with Volumetric Camera Tracking, the latest innovation utilizing the photo-realistic, multi-dimensional rendering capabilities known in the gaming industry, to radically transform the location and on-set capabilities of even the most modest production. See video below.</p><p><strong>Production Budget and Timetable</strong></p><p>Our first season of eight (8) episodes at ten (10) minutes per episode, is budgeted at $50,000, roughly $6k per episode, including music.</p><p>In addition to the savings realized from shooting virtual, as a long-time industry professional, I have relationships with many award-winning film technicians and creatives that make it possible for us to produce a quality show at this price. My partner and head writer, Melody Cooper, is coming off a big year in which she won Best Screenplay at the 2019 Urban World Film Festival, has been spotlighted as an up and coming writer by the industry, is now actively represented by Circle of Confusion, the Hollywood management company packaging many of today’s successful films. Together, we have developed a dynamic circle of collaborators that are engaged and excited by The Next Iteration.</p><p><strong>Production Timetable</strong></p><p>Upon commencement of production, our time will be spent accordingly:</p><p>* Pre-production 10 weeks - writing, casting, rehearsing, computer set design </p><p>* Principal Photography 3 weeks</p><p>* Post Production 12 weeks</p><p><b>Distribution. Audience Development. Overages.</b></p><p>We are crowdfunding this series because we are entrepreneurs. Our strategy is to use what we raise to produce the series one episode at a time if need be, $6,000 per episode.</p><p>Our hope is that this series will become a self-sustaining enterprise through a direct relationship with the people that are intrigued by the stories we tell.*</p><p>I have spent all of my adult life as an entrepreneur in the entertainment business. I have had international success with the projects I've been directly involved with, and I have created evergreen programming for top industry players. In the over 25 years that I've been in the business as an attorney, distributor and producer, I have developed a very clear vision for the industrial-sized possibilities that great programming can create. Crowdfunding and it's evolution from donor based to the opportunity for equity ownership, is empowering entrepreneurs outside of the corridors of Wall Street/Hollywood, and democratizing the media landscape of images and ideas.</p><p>Our strategy of using the short-form ""webisode"" format is designed for immediate impact with our audiences wherever they are, and to quickly scale up once the production ball is rolling and the community is growing. We can work within the confines of important industry organizations like SAG, while maintaining maximum budgetary flexibility: we can produce the whole season of eight episodes for roughly $6,000 per episode, or $50k for Season One.</p><p>In our minds, as entrepreneurs, our per episode cost is calculated to achieve maximum quality at the most efficient price, allowing for a realistic opportunity to achieve a respectable return on investment without having to go from zero to 100 mph immediately, giving the series time to steadily grow its audience. Our intentions to shoot the series utilizing Virtual Set technology is part of this effort to achieve maximum quality at an efficient price. The scenic and location flexibility, cost savings and dynamism of the Unreal Gaming engine's photo-realistic rendering, increases the upward possibilities of ROI for independently produced and distributed audio-visual entertainment.</p><p>In the event we raise more money for production than currently budgeted, we will use overages to support our community building, marketing and distribution efforts.</p><h3><strong>Team Members</strong></h3><p><strong>Marlin L.

This is a character driven drama, with the mood and feel of an  “X-files” adventure in pursuit of a “Wakanda-like” world.Virtual Set ProductionWe intend to shoot the series using the on-set, real-time rendering capabilities of the Unreal Gaming Engine with Volumetric Camera Tracking, the latest innovation utilizing the photo-realistic, multi-dimensional rendering capabilities known in the gaming industry, to radically transform the location and on-set capabilities of even the most modest production. See video below.Production Budget and TimetableOur first season of eight (8) episodes at ten (10) minutes per episode, is budgeted at $50,000, roughly $6k per episode, including music.In addition to the savings realized from shooting virtual, as a long-time industry professional, I have relationships with many award-winning film technicians and creatives that make it possible for us to produce a quality show at this price. My partner and head writer, Melody Cooper, is coming off a big year in which she won Best Screenplay at the 2019 Urban World Film Festival, has been spotlighted as an up and coming writer by the industry, is now actively represented by Circle of Confusion, the Hollywood management company packaging many of today’s successful films. Together, we have developed a dynamic circle of collaborators that are engaged and excited by The Next Iteration.Production TimetableUpon commencement of production, our time will be spent accordingly:* Pre-production 10 weeks - writing, casting, rehearsing, computer set design * Principal Photography 3 weeks* Post Production 12 weeksDistribution. Audience Development. Overages.We are crowdfunding this series because we are entrepreneurs. Our strategy is to use what we raise to produce the series one episode at a time if need be, $6,000 per episode.Our hope is that this series will become a self-sustaining enterprise through a direct relationship with the people that are intrigued by the stories we tell.*I have spent all of my adult life as an entrepreneur in the entertainment business. I have had international success with the projects I've been directly involved with, and I have created evergreen programming for top industry players. In the over 25 years that I've been in the business as an attorney, distributor and producer, I have developed a very clear vision for the industrial-sized possibilities that great programming can create. Crowdfunding and it's evolution from donor based to the opportunity for equity ownership, is empowering entrepreneurs outside of the corridors of Wall Street/Hollywood, and democratizing the media landscape of images and ideas.Our strategy of using the short-form ""webisode"" format is designed for immediate impact with our audiences wherever they are, and to quickly scale up once the production ball is rolling and the community is growing. We can work within the confines of important industry organizations like SAG, while maintaining maximum budgetary flexibility: we can produce the whole season of eight episodes for roughly $6,000 per episode, or $50k for Season One.In our minds, as entrepreneurs, our per episode cost is calculated to achieve maximum quality at the most efficient price, allowing for a realistic opportunity to achieve a respectable return on investment without having to go from zero to 100 mph immediately, giving the series time to steadily grow its audience. Our intentions to shoot the series utilizing Virtual Set technology is part of this effort to achieve maximum quality at an efficient price. The scenic and location flexibility, cost savings and dynamism of the Unreal Gaming engine's photo-realistic rendering, increases the upward possibilities of ROI for independently produced and distributed audio-visual entertainment.In the event we raise more money for production than currently budgeted, we will use overages to support our community building, marketing and distribution efforts.Team MembersMarlin L.

<p>During the early 1900's, Willie and Frank Macleod chose to ignore the legends of spirits and devils in order to seek the stories of gold, and ventured into an area of the Nahanni called <strong>Deadman's Valley</strong> never to return. A couple years later, the remains of the Macleods were found tied to a tree with their heads cut off (and never found). This along with numerous other mysterious experiences, disapearances and deaths, has led to the Nahanni's mysterious reputation. A remote region difficult to access and rarely explored in many areas.</p>
<p><strong>""Secrets of Nahanni""</strong> seeks to further investigate the legends of the Nahanni Valley through a two-week river expedition. This documentary will journey deep into the river valleys and remote mountain ranges - <strong>venturing into areas often avoided, restricted to the public and rarely explored first hand</strong> - to unearth that unknown essence beneath the surface of the Nahanni that has fuelled for centuries the tales of “something else”, while giving a sense of the natural richness and beauty of this area that has made it such a sacred and special place.</p>
<p>Before the river expedition begins, we will first explore deeper beyond the European stories by <strong>capturing the folklore and oral histories of the Dene, Sahtu, Métis and Decho First Nation storytellers.</strong> These local legends predate the European tales by thousands of years and hold more clues, questions and mysteries of what secrets remain hidden along the river banks and valleys of the Nahanni. </p>
<p>By capturing the local First Nations stories first hand, we will create a unique experience of the Nahanni's legends by presenting them with more depth and diversity than ever before. By sharing these stories in the words of local story tellers and elders, ""Secrets of Nahanni"" will offer a richer, deeper exploration of Nahanni's mysteries and legends, travelling further back in time to the source of these mysterious tales. </p>

<p><strong>REMOTE LOCATION:</strong> With no roads into Nahanni Valley, it is only accessible by air and water or a long overland journey on foot. Much of the area remains unexplored, despite being declared a National Park and World Heritage Site. Few people get the opportunity to explore this remote region first hand and we want to share this experience with a POV style documentary of our expedition. </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531176156/odemj6qnv4lzxpa9zy7b.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>ACCESS TO RESTRICTED AREAS:</strong> We have been granted rare access to  Class-1 restricted areas, non-accessible to the public, including Deadman's Valley where many of the legends originate and the sacred Tuffa Mounds. </p>
<p><strong>COMPLETED 6 MONTH APPROVAL PROCESS &amp; READY TO FILM:</strong>  We are one of the few to be awarded access to film in Nahanni National Park and the first given the opportunity to record local oral histories through a 6 month process by the NaHa Consensus Team (made up of the local Dene, Sahtu &amp; Metis First Nations representatives and Parks Canada). </p>

<p><strong>We are seeking to raise $60K to help us complete our two phases of filming. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The FIRST PHASE of production (budgeted at around 10K) is to film and capture the local oral histories and stories of the Dene, Sahtu and Metis First Nations to capture the many legends and mysteries never before recorded. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The SECOND PHASE of production (budgeted at around $50K) is to film our multi-week river expedition into the Nahanni. This includes our exploration along the South Nahanni River and surrounding areas like Deadman's Valley to seek out and unearth the areas related to these tales and legends. </strong></p>
<p>As a stretch goal, reaching $150K would further cover the editing (Post Production) and marketing aspects of the documentary along with additional film elements such as 360 VR content, night cameras as well as allow us to film more cinematic elements to better tell and recreate aspects of these oral histories and tales dating back centuries.</p>
<p>We are planning to begin our our first phase of production for Fall 2018 to capture all the legends and oral histories followed with filming the multi-week river expedition in 2019. </p>
<p>Making a documentary film can be complicated and expensive. But we have a small team of filmmakers wearing many hats along with a lot of experience filming in remote locations. This allow us to stretch our budget further to explore more areas, share more mysteries &amp; tales and give a higher production value in return (aka... a kick ass film).</p>
<p>Funds will be used for film production (including the 2 week river expedition to reach these legendary areas, aerial drone, night cameras and 360 VR footage), story producing, filming of the local oral histories, narration, editing, visual effects (titles, geographical maps of the journey and 3D motion graphics), sound mixing, music composition and recording of an original score (for the majority of the film), distribution, publicity, and legal costs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project will for the first time explore the Nahanni Valley (Deadman's valley) beyond the main riverways using modern filmmaking tools such as, aerial drones, 360 cams, night cameras and other modern tech.</li>
<li>For the FIRST TIME,  local First Nations oral histories predating THOUSANDS OF YEARS will be recorded and shared to seek out the roots behind the mysteries experienced by European explorers and colonial Canadians during the 19th/20th Centuries. </li>
</ul>
<p>It's also important to note that our team has a successful track record filming in remote areas as well as capturing cultural histories and stories across Canada, the United States and the UK. Whether its photographing Polar Bears on the Hudson Bay Coast, filming the haunted underground habitats of Edinburgh or capturing the coast lines of Bermuda our crew has a depth of experience with different environments and cultures to capture these mysterious stories and the mind-blowing landscapes surrounding them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Waheela's, ghost tribes and evil spirits aside... our biggest challenge with this adventure documentary will be the risks associated with a river expedition in a remote region of the world. Wildlife such as bears, wolves, and moose will be one challenge along with white water rapids, rain, snow (it is northern Canada), sun exposure, hydration, keeping warm, and other charms of backwoods ventures will be our main challenges to manage.</p>
<p>To meet these challenges we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A world class film crew with experience filming in remote locations and extreme weather.</li>
<li>The best in the business guiding us with Nahanni Wild whose decades of river guiding experience in the Nahanni and wilderness first aid &amp; swift-water rescue training will ensure we are safe.</li>
<li>Emergency communication &amp; support for worst case scenarios such as med evacs or field rescues. </li>
<li>Tried and tested film gear and equipment for rugged, wet and remote conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also commit to respecting the environment to protect the areas we travel through along with the local First Nations who care for this land. In our pursuit to share the Nahanni's natural wonders we commit to conserving wilderness to allow future generations to experience the wonders of intact ecosystems.</p>

</div></div>","During the early 1900's, Willie and Frank Macleod chose to ignore the legends of spirits and devils in order to seek the stories of gold, and ventured into an area of the Nahanni called Deadman's Valley never to return. A couple years later, the remains of the Macleods were found tied to a tree with their heads cut off (and never found). This along with numerous other mysterious experiences, disapearances and deaths, has led to the Nahanni's mysterious reputation. A remote region difficult to access and rarely explored in many areas.
""Secrets of Nahanni"" seeks to further investigate the legends of the Nahanni Valley through a two-week river expedition. This documentary will journey deep into the river valleys and remote mountain ranges - venturing into areas often avoided, restricted to the public and rarely explored first hand - to unearth that unknown essence beneath the surface of the Nahanni that has fuelled for centuries the tales of “something else”, while giving a sense of the natural richness and beauty of this area that has made it such a sacred and special place.
Before the river expedition begins, we will first explore deeper beyond the European stories by capturing the folklore and oral histories of the Dene, Sahtu, Métis and Decho First Nation storytellers. These local legends predate the European tales by thousands of years and hold more clues, questions and mysteries of what secrets remain hidden along the river banks and valleys of the Nahanni. 
By capturing the local First Nations stories first hand, we will create a unique experience of the Nahanni's legends by presenting them with more depth and diversity than ever before. By sharing these stories in the words of local story tellers and elders, ""Secrets of Nahanni"" will offer a richer, deeper exploration of Nahanni's mysteries and legends, travelling further back in time to the source of these mysterious tales. 


REMOTE LOCATION: With no roads into Nahanni Valley, it is only accessible by air and water or a long overland journey on foot. Much of the area remains unexplored, despite being declared a National Park and World Heritage Site. Few people get the opportunity to explore this remote region first hand and we want to share this experience with a POV style documentary of our expedition. 

ACCESS TO RESTRICTED AREAS: We have been granted rare access to  Class-1 restricted areas, non-accessible to the public, including Deadman's Valley where many of the legends originate and the sacred Tuffa Mounds. 
COMPLETED 6 MONTH APPROVAL PROCESS & READY TO FILM:  We are one of the few to be awarded access to film in Nahanni National Park and the first given the opportunity to record local oral histories through a 6 month process by the NaHa Consensus Team (made up of the local Dene, Sahtu & Metis First Nations representatives and Parks Canada). 

We are seeking to raise $60K to help us complete our two phases of filming. 
The FIRST PHASE of production (budgeted at around 10K) is to film and capture the local oral histories and stories of the Dene, Sahtu and Metis First Nations to capture the many legends and mysteries never before recorded. 
The SECOND PHASE of production (budgeted at around $50K) is to film our multi-week river expedition into the Nahanni. This includes our exploration along the South Nahanni River and surrounding areas like Deadman's Valley to seek out and unearth the areas related to these tales and legends. 
As a stretch goal, reaching $150K would further cover the editing (Post Production) and marketing aspects of the documentary along with additional film elements such as 360 VR content, night cameras as well as allow us to film more cinematic elements to better tell and recreate aspects of these oral histories and tales dating back centuries.
We are planning to begin our our first phase of production for Fall 2018 to capture all the legends and oral histories followed with filming the multi-week river expedition in 2019. 
Making a documentary film can be complicated and expensive. But we have a small team of filmmakers wearing many hats along with a lot of experience filming in remote locations. This allow us to stretch our budget further to explore more areas, share more mysteries & tales and give a higher production value in return (aka... a kick ass film).
Funds will be used for film production (including the 2 week river expedition to reach these legendary areas, aerial drone, night cameras and 360 VR footage), story producing, filming of the local oral histories, narration, editing, visual effects (titles, geographical maps of the journey and 3D motion graphics), sound mixing, music composition and recording of an original score (for the majority of the film), distribution, publicity, and legal costs.

The Impact

This project will for the first time explore the Nahanni Valley (Deadman's valley) beyond the main riverways using modern filmmaking tools such as, aerial drones, 360 cams, night cameras and other modern tech.
For the FIRST TIME,  local First Nations oral histories predating THOUSANDS OF YEARS will be recorded and shared to seek out the roots behind the mysteries experienced by European explorers and colonial Canadians during the 19th/20th Centuries. 

It's also important to note that our team has a successful track record filming in remote areas as well as capturing cultural histories and stories across Canada, the United States and the UK. Whether its photographing Polar Bears on the Hudson Bay Coast, filming the haunted underground habitats of Edinburgh or capturing the coast lines of Bermuda our crew has a depth of experience with different environments and cultures to capture these mysterious stories and the mind-blowing landscapes surrounding them.

Risks & Challenges
Waheela's, ghost tribes and evil spirits aside... our biggest challenge with this adventure documentary will be the risks associated with a river expedition in a remote region of the world. Wildlife such as bears, wolves, and moose will be one challenge along with white water rapids, rain, snow (it is northern Canada), sun exposure, hydration, keeping warm, and other charms of backwoods ventures will be our main challenges to manage.
To meet these challenges we have:

A world class film crew with experience filming in remote locations and extreme weather.
The best in the business guiding us with Nahanni Wild whose decades of river guiding experience in the Nahanni and wilderness first aid & swift-water rescue training will ensure we are safe.
Emergency communication & support for worst case scenarios such as med evacs or field rescues. 
Tried and tested film gear and equipment for rugged, wet and remote conditions.

We also commit to respecting the environment to protect the areas we travel through along with the local First Nations who care for this land. In our pursuit to share the Nahanni's natural wonders we commit to conserving wilderness to allow future generations to experience the wonders of intact ecosystems.

The Expedition & Filmmaking Team

There is something very primal that exploration and adventure feeds. With ""Secrets of Nahanni"", my hope is to capture the spirit of Nahanni, in its physical nature, reputation and through the stories of the people who first hand live the unique experiences, mysteries and natural wonders of Nahanni National Park.

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>  My show concept has been worked on, tweaked, revised and streamlined for the past 4 years and I am more than confident in its success due to the input I have been given by TV producers, production company executives, my TV production consultant and the numerous ""A"" list artists that want to be on an episode. My show is unlike anything as it is a combination of several hit TV reality shows like: American Pickers, Counts Customs,The Velocity Channel, HGTV, MTV and MTV Cribs as I take you on a journey through the process of inspiration, design, fabrication and finally how it becomes one with its owner. As a second generation skilled tradesman, it is vital to continue to pass along what my dad has taught me and I plan on doing this by bringing the show on the road to various stores such as Maynards, Home Depot, Lowes etc and set up welding and fabricating seminars to boost the skilled trades industry. I have some special surprises during these events as I plan on having some of my designs on hand as well as one of my many SAWBLADEHEAD artists to stop by for a musical performance. What I have created for myself and others is proof of what I can do and with the proper resources, I can continue to create bolder, more beautiful, empowering, inspiring and functional artwork that will be my legacy for generations. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that come hell or high water I will complete this pilot. If I don't raise enough money, it will take me longer to complete the pilot as I will have to do all my own video production as well as create and fabricate a design specifically for the artist. I created my largest and internationally known creation, my LIFE TREE drum sculpture out of scrap metal with minimal tools and absolutely NO torches or forging, outside in my backyard in the intense Florida heat! I have numerous artist that want my designs from a custom microphone stand to a full drum sculpture or possibly an office desk to a full custom bar and bar stools. The funds raised will dictate how BIG my creation will be but whatever I create, it will be EPIC!!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where the funds go if I don't reach the entire goal.</strong></li>
<li>In the event that I do not reach my goal, I do have (2) back up plan options.                                    Depending on the amount of funds raised, the majority of the budget will go towards production expenses which includes but not limited to: video preproduction, location permits or rental if needed,filming, editing, post production, misc production expense and project material expense.</li>
<li>option (1) If I receive 60-90% of my goal, the majority of this budget will go towards video production and the remaining funds will have to cover the project materials.</li>
<li>option (2) If I receive less than 60% of my goal then I have the ability to barter with local video production companies and create something personal for them or possibly something for their company while the limited funds raised will go towards the project materials. Who knows, maybe they'll be featured on a episode!! But either way, it will take me longer to complete this pilot episode but IT WILL GET DONE!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> Spreading the word will have a major impact on the success of this series, so please share the indiegogo link and ""like""and share the links below. However, the more money that is raised will not only assist in creating a one of a kind work of art, but will also give inspiration and empowerment to the artist and everyone that gazes upon it! So tell your friends, family, coworkers, band mates, and anyone that wishes to be apart of this journey with me!</p>

The Impact
  My show concept has been worked on, tweaked, revised and streamlined for the past 4 years and I am more than confident in its success due to the input I have been given by TV producers, production company executives, my TV production consultant and the numerous ""A"" list artists that want to be on an episode. My show is unlike anything as it is a combination of several hit TV reality shows like: American Pickers, Counts Customs,The Velocity Channel, HGTV, MTV and MTV Cribs as I take you on a journey through the process of inspiration, design, fabrication and finally how it becomes one with its owner. As a second generation skilled tradesman, it is vital to continue to pass along what my dad has taught me and I plan on doing this by bringing the show on the road to various stores such as Maynards, Home Depot, Lowes etc and set up welding and fabricating seminars to boost the skilled trades industry. I have some special surprises during these events as I plan on having some of my designs on hand as well as one of my many SAWBLADEHEAD artists to stop by for a musical performance. What I have created for myself and others is proof of what I can do and with the proper resources, I can continue to create bolder, more beautiful, empowering, inspiring and functional artwork that will be my legacy for generations. 
 

Risks & Challenges
 I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that come hell or high water I will complete this pilot. If I don't raise enough money, it will take me longer to complete the pilot as I will have to do all my own video production as well as create and fabricate a design specifically for the artist. I created my largest and internationally known creation, my LIFE TREE drum sculpture out of scrap metal with minimal tools and absolutely NO torches or forging, outside in my backyard in the intense Florida heat! I have numerous artist that want my designs from a custom microphone stand to a full drum sculpture or possibly an office desk to a full custom bar and bar stools. The funds raised will dictate how BIG my creation will be but whatever I create, it will be EPIC!!

Where the funds go if I don't reach the entire goal.
In the event that I do not reach my goal, I do have (2) back up plan options.                                    Depending on the amount of funds raised, the majority of the budget will go towards production expenses which includes but not limited to: video preproduction, location permits or rental if needed,filming, editing, post production, misc production expense and project material expense.
option (1) If I receive 60-90% of my goal, the majority of this budget will go towards video production and the remaining funds will have to cover the project materials.
option (2) If I receive less than 60% of my goal then I have the ability to barter with local video production companies and create something personal for them or possibly something for their company while the limited funds raised will go towards the project materials. Who knows, maybe they'll be featured on a episode!! But either way, it will take me longer to complete this pilot episode but IT WILL GET DONE!


 
Other Ways You Can Help
 Spreading the word will have a major impact on the success of this series, so please share the indiegogo link and ""like""and share the links below. However, the more money that is raised will not only assist in creating a one of a kind work of art, but will also give inspiration and empowerment to the artist and everyone that gazes upon it! So tell your friends, family, coworkers, band mates, and anyone that wishes to be apart of this journey with me!

A UN school student, he was the kind of kid who would use his subway pass to check out different ethnic enclaves around town just to sample the city’s different cultures _ mostly in the form of food.

With 193 nations represented at the UN, New York is home to more foreign cuisines than any other world capital.

During the meal, we learn about more than just food, we learn about the diplomat’s country, the neighborhood around the restaurant and the people who live there. In this way, the show provides a taste of the international community that surrounds us and opens up the city’s neighborhoods as foreign destinations.</p><p>With a dash of humor and a sprinkling of fascinating insights, the show not only celebrates eating but also our interconnectedness as a city, country and planet.</p><p>Dining with Diplomats speaks to New York visitors, citizens, and food adventurers on the hunt for the real deal.

<p>After Brexit and Trump, people were saying you can’t do satire anymore. That seemed really wrong to us, because we could all do with a laugh right now. Leaver or remainer, you have to admit the whole process is so farcical on a daily basis that it begs to be satirised.</p>
<p>The big challenge for us is referencing real events and keeping it current. When things change so fast, we have to write ahead of events and hope we were right after the fact. So far, we often have been!</p>
<p>In late 2017, we created three 20-minute episodes on a beg, borrow and steal budget to test the waters, and we’ve been blown away by the positive response and requests for more episodes. Now we need your support to make them.</p>

<p>We are asking for the budget for seven more episodes. Can Clive and his team save the country from ""No Deal""? Will Hugo learn how to run the department? Will Brexit happen at all? We managed to make our first three episodes for about £500 each, but that was without paying the contributors. We want to pay our actors and crew a nominal fee. They have given their time and considerable skill, and they deserve to be paid.</p>
<h3>The Numbers</h3>
<p><strong>(Unlike the Government, we have a financial impact report.)</strong></p>
<p>Going forward, we have budgeted £1,500 per episode.  As before, we have allowed £500 for production costs. This breaks down as follows (per episode):</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Actor Travel Expenses - 2.7%</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Audition Costs - 0.7%</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Catering - 1.7%</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Equipment -  1.3%</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Set Dressing - 1.3%</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Able Archer and Negotiations have gone from strength to strength, but we cannot afford to keep funding Negotiations from our own pocket. Since we have a had such a great response to the first three episodes, we’re asking you to help. If everyone who watched an episode of Negotiations gave us £3, we would smash our target. That's the cost of a coffee.</p>

<h3>Can we do it?</h3>
<p>We have a fantastic team on board, both in front of and behind the camera. Coming from a background of short film-making, we cut our teeth on the unique challenges of a series by making three episodes with almost no resources.  We've proved we can do it, and we want to give you more. Our biggest challenge is current events. We don't know what will happen next, but with your help, we can finish the story. </p>

<p>If you can’t contribute financially, there are other ways you can help us that would be equally amazing!</p>

</div></div>","Able Archer is a co-operative of actors, directors and filmmakers who embrace the silly and ridiculous aspects of the world and channel them into comedic films and projects. We endeavour to give people who haven't had the opportunity to make work to do so. This is the company’s first foray into an episodic series.


After Brexit and Trump, people were saying you can’t do satire anymore. That seemed really wrong to us, because we could all do with a laugh right now. Leaver or remainer, you have to admit the whole process is so farcical on a daily basis that it begs to be satirised.
The big challenge for us is referencing real events and keeping it current. When things change so fast, we have to write ahead of events and hope we were right after the fact. So far, we often have been!
In late 2017, we created three 20-minute episodes on a beg, borrow and steal budget to test the waters, and we’ve been blown away by the positive response and requests for more episodes. Now we need your support to make them.
Haven't seen Episodes 1-3? Watch them here:



 

 


We are asking for the budget for seven more episodes. Can Clive and his team save the country from ""No Deal""? Will Hugo learn how to run the department? Will Brexit happen at all? We managed to make our first three episodes for about £500 each, but that was without paying the contributors. We want to pay our actors and crew a nominal fee. They have given their time and considerable skill, and they deserve to be paid.
The Numbers
(Unlike the Government, we have a financial impact report.)
Going forward, we have budgeted £1,500 per episode.  As before, we have allowed £500 for production costs. This breaks down as follows (per episode):

Actor Travel Expenses - 2.7%
Audition Costs - 0.7%
Catering - 1.7%
Equipment -  1.3%
Location Hire - 20.7%
Logistics (Transport of equipment) - 1.7%
Promotions (Twitter/Facebook) - 1.3%
Props - 2%
Set Dressing - 1.3%
Actor & Crew Fees - 66.7%*
*This is the lion's share of the budget, but bear in mind this works out as no more than £50 per shoot day for each person involved!
Those of you paying attention will note that £1,500 for 7 episodes only makes £10,500, so where does the other £1,500 go? Simple. To pay for the perks and Indiegogo's fee.
