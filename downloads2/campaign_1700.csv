After this is created we will be entering it into film festivals in New York and New Jersey in 2017. Then eventually will allow us to create a full length film.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>We are a group of Creative Event Management students at Arts University Bournemouth, who want to leave behind an artistic legacy and provide opportunities for the local creative community. </h3>
<ul>
<li>This campaign has arisen from our collective passion for the arts and the need for more opportunities for creative people and students in Bournemouth. The R.A.W project aims to promote and expand upon the creative scene that currently exists and to act as a platform for aspiring artists across Dorset and the surrounding area. </li>
<li>With your backing our vision will become a reality as we can deliver this project to its full potential and the event will be a celebration of creativity in Bournemouth. The mural will act as a beacon of the towns cultural identity and will  be enjoyed by many for years to come!</li>
<li>Our event will help bring all of the creatives to one place and realise what can be achieved. The interest already from our artist callouts and online marketing has been greatly received by local artists and creative groups. There is a real need for finding a creative networking hub for those within the town, and making Bournemouth something to shout about. Alongside this, students struggle to enter the real world after university and our multi-media exhibition event will also feature specialised talks and workshops that will offer advice and inspiration once they have graduated. A series of creative public art events in the lead up to the final event will bring colour, engagement and fun to the passersby of Bournemouth, invoking motivation to use creativity as a tool to increase quality of life. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your donations will go directly towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding the artists who will be exhibiting work at our exhibition. We are putting this event on to promote young, aspiring artists at the beginning of their careers as well as the local creative community of Bournemouth. This event will be a celebration of them and their work and so we aim to pay all of our artists a fair wage for contributing work, which will be directly funded by you.</li>
<li>We are also aiming to bring you interactive workshops that will engage you in different creative mediums such as live screen printing, stencil workshops, live painting and print workshops. We need money to pay our contributors and to buy the materials that will make these as interesting an experience as possible for you, the audience.</li>
<li>Not only this but you will also be directly funding the repainting of the mural, which is the focal point of the event. This mural will act as a cultural landmark for Bournemouth and will be a tourist attraction for years to come; however, without your support none of this will be possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>The R.A.W Project aims to promote the arts in Bournemouth and the Southwest and this event will be a melting pot of creativity that we really want you to be a part of.</p>
<p>Our incentives are focused around promoting all of the artists and brands that we work with so everything you receive from our stickers to our postcards, prints and t-shirts will be designed or made by our contributors, which means it will all be original and unique. We are working in collaboration with SULK studio to bring you some unique t-shirt and sticker designs that will only be available through our Indiegogo page and on the day at the event.</p>
<p>However, if you aren’t that interested in receiving any of our amazing incentives (you’d be mad not to) but would still like to donate, there is an option to pay what you like and not receive anything in return, apart from our eternal gratitude. All you need to do is hit the ‘Back It’ button and enter the amount you’d like to donate.</p>
<p>We are applying for grants as other forms of funding however we still need to reach our target to achieve everything to make this event a success.</p>
<p>If we do not manage to meet our target however, then we will have to scale back so that we can only deliver the mural and the exhibition parts of the event. Of course we would hate to do this, as we want the event to be as fun and interactive for you as possible so please help us reach our ultimate goal.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>
<p>R.A.W project will act as a platform for creatives in Bournemouth to stand up and be counted and they will have their chance to leave an artistic legacy in the town centre. The local creative community are in many ways socially segregated in this seaside town and there is little chance for creative opportunities, skills development and networking, hence resulting in many leaving town and heading for more artistic towns and cities for better support.</p>
<p>Bournemouth is already on the turn and things are looking bright for the future and we want to add to that through our project. There is large scale urban redevelopment in the town centre happening right now and Bournemouth Arts By The Sea Festival grows year on year. The Arts University has also expanded massively in recent times and we feel our event is the perfect opportunity for students and artists to integrate with the local population in a positive and constructive way, further developing relationships and public perceptions. There is a large social gap very present and events like this will help build the foundations to closing this gap. </p>
<p>If public creative projects are seen to be on the rise, it will further enhance a place of identity and attract cultural industries and investment to town. </p>
</li>
<li><p>We have the experience of our entire degree behind us, plus the support of our professional tutors, local creative organisations and the Council to make this project happen in the most professional and accessible way possible.</p></li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As event managers we pose the risk of not understanding the needs of the artists and creatives. Therefore, we are in contact with local artists and local artist development companies to always check our process and communication. That way, those that are getting the opportunities can tell us exactly what they need, and how best to positively impact the community.</p>
<p>Funding for our project is a huge hurdle, one that our course has prepared us for. We are always given the latest opportunities and methods to maximise our funding. Professional funding officers within the creative community, and from our university, are helping us make sure we are doing everything we can. Additionally, we have prepared plans to help our event go ahead even if we do not reach our full funding potential - with our support and training, so no matter what, R.A.W project will thrive!</p>
<p>Organisation is key to our project; there are many different aspects and it is essential we work to the best of our management abilities. Between our team of six, we have assigned roles to ensure that nothing gets lost or forgotten. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you aren't able to contribute, that's not all you can do!</p>
<p>Shout about our project as much as you can - we have attached our social media links and from there anyone can speak to us and see what we get up to. Word of mouth is essential when working with the creative community, and we want you all to talk! Networking is a key aspect of our project and therefore just you talking about it, is helping it succeed.</p>
<p>Don't forget, Indiegogo has share tools specifically for making this kind of sharing easy to do! </p>
<p>Please share our campaign, and help real art win !!!</p>

<p>Often drawing on the walls as a toddler, my flair for art and design developed at an early age. My passion is creating captivating visuals and authentic experiences. Shopping for the perfect gift, I was disappointed in the lack of options for African-American women with curly tresses.

My hope is to bring diversity to the marketplace of novelties and gifts.</p>
<p>I envisions inundating the marketplace this holiday season with riveting illustrations that will set a new standard for gift wrap. Curly Contessa gift wrap blurs the line between fine art and holiday décor to create an emotional connection that captivates customers. I am seeking investments to help make my vision a reality.</p>

<p>In order to produce this documentary and book, I plan on conducting a research trip in Paris and attending exhibitions there while I also visit multiple galleries. The flight to Paris has already been paid for. I am especially excited to see the Mucha Museum and study the art of Alfons Mucha, but in order to do this right, I need to raise some start-up capital.</p>
<p>This is where you come in, friends. I am looking for $5000 to cover my operating costs, the costs of printing the book, the costs of launching the book, and the costs of paying for food and accommodations while I am in Paris and Prague. As a thank-you, I am offering some exciting rewards to you, my valued contributors, including prints of masterworks in the art nouveau style.</p>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>We are artists, architects and designers from 5 different countries who met at the San Francisco Art Institute several years ago. We are collaboratively designing and fabricating a large immersive installation that will be exhibited at the <a href=""http://www.headlands.org/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Headlands Center for the Arts</a>, an interdisciplinary art space in Northern California.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is our Work About?</h3>
<p><i>As Though It Rained From Stars</i> is a site-specific pavilion formally inspired by the starry dome of a 15th century Islamic bathhouse in the abandoned city of Mandu, India.</p>
<p>Themed along questions of desire and longing, this immersive art installation is both a tribute and a reckoning to the poetry, beauty, power and darkness of present times. </p>
<p>This art work is multi-sensory and interactive. Engaging with the gut, we pose an impossible question -<strong><i> </i></strong><i>what it would feel like to have your desires reflected back at you in a physical space?</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522960148/bfyuhtqula8t59zzpjdz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>How are we Fabricating this?</strong></h3>
<p>We have been working on this project since 2016, and are now near completion. </p>
<p>We started with dreams and drawings. We built models and prototypes. We experimented with shapes and forms. We created 3D models. We CNC router cut 6 unique molds. We cast them each 8 times in polyurethane rubber. We built a wooden structure to hold the rubber together in shape. We joined the structure with hinges.</p>
<p>We are always thinking about the space and the audience.</p>

</div><div><p>Help us spread the word about this project. Find us on instagram, and facebook, share our story with your friends!</p></div></div>","Who Are We?
We are artists, architects and designers from 5 different countries who met at the San Francisco Art Institute several years ago. We are collaboratively designing and fabricating a large immersive installation that will be exhibited at the Headlands Center for the Arts, an interdisciplinary art space in Northern California.
 
What is our Work About?
As Though It Rained From Stars is a site-specific pavilion formally inspired by the starry dome of a 15th century Islamic bathhouse in the abandoned city of Mandu, India.
Themed along questions of desire and longing, this immersive art installation is both a tribute and a reckoning to the poetry, beauty, power and darkness of present times. 
This art work is multi-sensory and interactive. Engaging with the gut, we pose an impossible question - what it would feel like to have your desires reflected back at you in a physical space?


 
 
How are we Fabricating this?
We have been working on this project since 2016, and are now near completion. 
We started with dreams and drawings. We built models and prototypes. We experimented with shapes and forms. We created 3D models. We CNC router cut 6 unique molds. We cast them each 8 times in polyurethane rubber. We built a wooden structure to hold the rubber together in shape. We joined the structure with hinges.
We are always thinking about the space and the audience.





 
 
What We Need & What You Get

We need your help to fabricate this project. While we have a dedicated and highly skilled team building this piece, we need funding for the polyurethane rubber which will make the cilia soft, tactile and interactive. Additionally, we need funding for purchasing the birch ply that will be used in the structure, hinges and hardware to put the panels together, and lights to backlight the piece.
We have awesome perks for those of you who believe in our work and contribute to our campaign! Be on the gratitude list when the pavilion is installed. Receive designer T shirts and posters. The coolest one yet - be a part investor in the project and receive future payouts!
For those who cannot make it to the event, you will be treated to a full 3D 360 experience of the show, provided free of charge so that you can experience the full scale of the installation.

<p>Luna Flora came to our Lead Artist in a dream. In her own words:</p>
<p>""2017 was the beginning of a new nine-year celestial cycle, noted both as “The Year of the Goddess Awakening” and “The Divine Feminine Returning”.  As I reflect back on 2017, it is <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_400/v1524166572/tx2a5lenbf35ef7qdsid.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>undeniable that there is truth in that idea.  Women’s issues currently sit at the top of every news cycle. The cultural conciseness of the world has shifted it’s attention to #metoo, harassment in the workplace, violations of the body and mind, self worth and safety, gender identity and orientation.  In my own life this year has been one of deep healing of personal traumas from my childhood, teens and twenties.  I ventured out on a six week solo journey across the US for the 1st time to pursue a life I knew I deserved, a life filled with human connection, creativity, and the freedom to begin releasing the wounds of my past.  That trip concluded with my virgin year at Burning Man.  This was a life changing experience and while reflecting back on my 2017 experience, Luna Flora came to me in a dream. It is the culmination of my own twenty yearlong journey identifying as an artist represented in a single interactive sculpture.""</p>
<p><strong>A Network becomes a Team</strong></p>
<p>Our team of 11 has been assembled from an extended network two communities, one fostered by years spent in the Burningman and the second through the Urban Laboratory at Arcosanti. With a lead artist, an engineer, a project manager,  a lead builder, seven fabricators, and a documentarian, we intend to grow the seed of Luna Flora into a 15 foot tall installation on Playa, creating a documentary about the process along the way. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524162186/gdb3rn6hgns40ybws6tq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now more than ever Burner artwork is in the cultural consciousness. Part of this elevated awareness can be attributed to the rise of social media, the long term installation of Burner artwork in cities across the United States, and the massive and well received exhibition at the Smithsonian in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Through the building and documenting of our sculpture and it's eventually finding a permanent home off Playa, we hope to further the narrative that Burner art can make a meaningful impact to the world at large.</p>

<p>Every human, regardless of gender identity, has qualities of the feminine (yin) and the masculine (yang). The hope is that Luna Flora will inspire intriguing thoughts and conversation around this maintaining a healthy relationship to this balance in ourselves, our peer groups, and the world at large.  Like the moon, we live in a constant state of liminality or transition, settling only for a moment before moving into the next phase of life, growth, and creation.  This progression can be observed in our physical bodies, thoughts, relationships, and creative processes.  We hope this piece will inspire citizens to pause for a moment and reflect on the wonders and challenges of the human experience. </p>

</div></div>","A Dream becomes a Sculpture
Luna Flora came to our Lead Artist in a dream. In her own words:
""2017 was the beginning of a new nine-year celestial cycle, noted both as “The Year of the Goddess Awakening” and “The Divine Feminine Returning”.  As I reflect back on 2017, it is undeniable that there is truth in that idea.  Women’s issues currently sit at the top of every news cycle. The cultural conciseness of the world has shifted it’s attention to #metoo, harassment in the workplace, violations of the body and mind, self worth and safety, gender identity and orientation.  In my own life this year has been one of deep healing of personal traumas from my childhood, teens and twenties.  I ventured out on a six week solo journey across the US for the 1st time to pursue a life I knew I deserved, a life filled with human connection, creativity, and the freedom to begin releasing the wounds of my past.  That trip concluded with my virgin year at Burning Man.  This was a life changing experience and while reflecting back on my 2017 experience, Luna Flora came to me in a dream. It is the culmination of my own twenty yearlong journey identifying as an artist represented in a single interactive sculpture.""
A Network becomes a Team
Our team of 11 has been assembled from an extended network two communities, one fostered by years spent in the Burningman and the second through the Urban Laboratory at Arcosanti. With a lead artist, an engineer, a project manager,  a lead builder, seven fabricators, and a documentarian, we intend to grow the seed of Luna Flora into a 15 foot tall installation on Playa, creating a documentary about the process along the way. 

Now more than ever Burner artwork is in the cultural consciousness. Part of this elevated awareness can be attributed to the rise of social media, the long term installation of Burner artwork in cities across the United States, and the massive and well received exhibition at the Smithsonian in Washington D.C.
Through the building and documenting of our sculpture and it's eventually finding a permanent home off Playa, we hope to further the narrative that Burner art can make a meaningful impact to the world at large.
Our contributors are our collaborators. A dream only manifests as reality with the help of a community. With your contribution you will be invited along to come on this journey us.

What we're asking for...

Tier 1 Funding
$12,000
We need your help raising an additional $12,000. Tier 1 Funding for us has already been met in the form of $12,000 generously provided by a Burningman Honorarium grant to gets us started with the purchase of fabrication equipment, supplies, and transportation to Playa for Luna Flora. That having been said, several large purchases have already started to stretch our budget to an uncomfortable degree. Which brings us to...
Tier 2 Funding
$20,000
Meeting our Tier 2 Funding goals will ensure that our stretched budget from Tier 1 doesn't snap on us and risk the future of the project.
Beyond that goal, a project like this requires specialized skills and a unique personal investment from those who are collaborators to be willing to dedicate hundreds of hours of their time to it. For that reason, we have assembled a team of crew members from both the Southwest and East coast, all of whom understand that Luna Flora is a labor of love. 
To thank our crew for their work we would like to be able to pay for the cost of their trips out to Arcosanti for our build dates, plus attempt to cover personal transportation to and from Playa.
Tier 2 funding will also allow us to have a little bit of extra money set aside for any unforeseen circumstances (accidents, tool malfunctions, budget overrun, ect.) so that none of our artists have to shoulder the heavy financial burden that those scenarios can cause.
Tier 3 Funding
$24,000
Tier 3 funding is our ultimate goal. This amount will allow us to cover our costs entirely, plus offer a small stipend to the artists who have made a contribution to this project, including our graphic designers.
Any money raised beyond our tier 3 goal will be used to enhance the quality of the documentary being made about this journey, plus look into ways we might host that documentary online for free to the public, which will be our way of giving back to the community and a way to offer the world at large chance to see how much work goes into bringing a dream into reality in Black Rock City!

<p>Dar forma a un proyecto basado en la fotografía es un reto, pues
si hay una disciplina artística por la que tengo amor y pasión, es esta. Inicié
este viaje en búsqueda de una identidad estética y conceptual, tomando como
referencia elementos del lenguaje  fotográfico y cinematográfico junto al
sincretismo, muy presente en el día a día de esta sociedad y en lo que para mí es
su manifestación más compleja: la construcción constante de nuestro creole.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span><br/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b></b></span></p><h3>

<p>En este tiempo las cosas suceden tan rápidamente que se le da
más importancia a lo desechable. El valor del objeto que perdura por su
sello personal me seduce, y es por ello que he querido rescatar esos iconos de una tecnología anterior que nos abrieron los sentidos a ver el mundo y las artes de otra
forma. Los discos de vinilo, VHS, cassettes, álbumes, libros y revistas, los
transformo en instalaciones fotográficas y de video, tratando de rescatar la
esencia que me transmitieron, convirtiéndolos en piezas que no son lo que
parecen.</p>

<h3><i>About Me</i></h3>
<p><i>I’m Eliazar Ortiz, a Dominican multidisciplinary artist. I studied Civil
Engineering at the UNPHU and started working in that field; however I ended up
abandoning it to dedicate myself to art, my true vocation. I was trained as a
photographer at the EAF in Buenos Aires, where my first works were shown.
Returning to Santo Domingo in 2013, I participated and won Honorable Mention in
the Biennial of Visual Arts.</i></p>
<p><i> In 2015, I was awarded the Exposition
Prize as part of the Youth Prize of Centro de la Imagen in Santo Domingo. This
prize consists in the Centro providing gallery space and curatorial services
but does not contribute towards production of the work itself, frames,
transport, invitations, costs for the opening night event or for the
performance.</i></p>
<p><i>The exhibition is scheduled to take place in the Centro de la Imagen in
September 2016. It will be my first solo exhibition.</i></p>
<h3><i>Post Dembow Tempo </i></h3>
<p><i>Giving form to a project based on photography has been a challenge, as
this is one artistic discipline for which I feel especially passionate. I began
this voyage as a search for an esthetic and conceptual identity, taking asreference
point elements from photography and the cinema as well as cultural syncretism,
very present in our day-to-day living in what for me is its most complex
manifestation: the continuous construction of our own creole.</i></p>
<p><i>The exhibition consists of five photographic and
video installations. On opening night there will be a happening with live
music. We will be counting on the presence of a “palero” or Dominican
percussion player, and collaborating with us from Brussels,   <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/dove_cake/n-hour-of-power-w-z-n-rdio-pnik-vol1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>dø√∑ Ç@K∑:::</span></a> will be providing electronic
music. Elements worn by the performance artists
(clothing-books-magazines-photographs) will subsequently become part of the
installations.</i></p>
<p><i>In our time, things happen so quickly that more importance is given over
to the disposable. The value of objects that have survived due to their
personal stamp seduces me, and that’s why I’ve tried to rescue those icons of a
bygone technology which opened up our senses and taught us to see the world and
art in new ways. Vinyl LP’s, VHS tapes, cassettes, books and magazines: I take
these and transform them into photographic and video installations, trying to
recover the essence they conveyed to me, making them over into new items which
are not what they seem.</i></p>
<p><i>Mix – that is the basis of Post
Dembow Tempo: seeing how we deny one culture that dances with another, at
the same time reaffirming a common past, where it is our job to rediscover them
and tell new stories. Stores which I prefer to be not so much realistic as
derived from the mixture that characterizes our island: a Dembow recomposed and
deconstructed somewhere between the Absurd and the post-conceptual.</i></p>
<p><b><i>What We Need</i></b></p>
<p><i>In order to make this exhibition a reality we need $5,
300, to cover the costs of:</i></p>
<p><i>·<span> 
</span>Photographic prints</i></p>
<p><i>·<span> 
</span>Frames</i></p>

<p><i>·<span> 
</span>Transportation of the
works from my studio in Samana</i></p>
<p><i>·<span> 
</span>Video documentation
of the performance</i></p>
<p><i>The success of this project depends on our achieving
the goal. Some items were excluded in order to avoid having too high a budget
that would frustrate our expectations. However, we will be flexible with our
goals and adapt our proposal to the final amount raised. Hopefully, your
contributions will exceed the initial goal and allow us to realize this project
as it was originally conceived.</i></p>
<p><b><i>What You Get</i></b></p>
<p><i>I do believe one can be an artist and make a living
through self-management. Some of the items from the installations – photographs,
collage, objects – will also become part of the recompense for your support. I
hope you like them.</i></p>

Autorretrato en estudio. 2016 / Self-portrait in Studio. 2016
Soy Héctor Eliazar, un artista multidisciplinar dominicano. Estudié
ingeniería civil en la UNPHU y empecé a trabajar en ese
campo, sin embargo lo abandoné para dedicarme al arte que es mi verdadera
vocación. Me formé como fotógrafo en la EAF de Buenos
Aires, en donde comencé a mostrar mis primeros trabajos. Al volver a Santo
Domingo en el 2013 gané una mención de honor en la Bienal de las artes visuales
y en el año 2015 fui galardonado con el Premio Expositivo del Premio Joven del Centro de la Imagen de Santo Domingo. Este premio consiste
en la cesión del espacio y curaduría por parte del Centro, pero no contribuye
en la producción de la obra, marcos, transporte, invitaciones, gastos de
inauguración y performance.
La exposición tendrá lugar en el Centro de la Imagen de Santo Domingo
durante el mes de septiembre, dentro de la VI edición de Photoimagen. Será mi
primera exposición individual.
Post Dembow
Tempo 
Dar forma a un proyecto basado en la fotografía es un reto, pues
si hay una disciplina artística por la que tengo amor y pasión, es esta. Inicié
este viaje en búsqueda de una identidad estética y conceptual, tomando como
referencia elementos del lenguaje  fotográfico y cinematográfico junto al
sincretismo, muy presente en el día a día de esta sociedad y en lo que para mí es
su manifestación más compleja: la construcción constante de nuestro creole.

La muestra se compone de cinco instalaciones fotográficas y de
video. Durante la apertura habrá un happening con música en directo, en la que
contaremos con un palero en la percusión y la colaboración desde Bruselas de
 dø√∑ Ç@K∑::: en la música electrónica. Los
elementos que llevarán los actores
(indumentarias-libros-magazines-fotográficos) serán posteriormente parte de una
de las instalaciones.

En este tiempo las cosas suceden tan rápidamente que se le da
más importancia a lo desechable. El valor del objeto que perdura por su
sello personal me seduce, y es por ello que he querido rescatar esos iconos de una tecnología anterior que nos abrieron los sentidos a ver el mundo y las artes de otra
forma. Los discos de vinilo, VHS, cassettes, álbumes, libros y revistas, los
transformo en instalaciones fotográficas y de video, tratando de rescatar la
esencia que me transmitieron, convirtiéndolos en piezas que no son lo que
parecen.

Mezcla, en eso se basa Post Dembow Tempo. Ver como negamos una
cultura que baila con otra, reivindicando a la vez un pasado en común, donde
nos corresponde redescubrirlas y contar nuevas historias, que, en mi caso, más
que realistas las prefiero como la mezcla característica de esta isla: un
dembow que se compone y se desconstruye entre lo absurdo y lo post-conceptual.

this is one artistic discipline for which I feel especially passionate. I began
this voyage as a search for an esthetic and conceptual identity, taking asreference
point elements from photography and the cinema as well as cultural syncretism,
very present in our day-to-day living in what for me is its most complex
manifestation: the continuous construction of our own creole.
The exhibition consists of five photographic and
video installations. On opening night there will be a happening with live
music. We will be counting on the presence of a “palero” or Dominican
percussion player, and collaborating with us from Brussels,   dø√∑ Ç@K∑::: will be providing electronic
music. Elements worn by the performance artists
(clothing-books-magazines-photographs) will subsequently become part of the
installations.
In our time, things happen so quickly that more importance is given over
to the disposable. The value of objects that have survived due to their
personal stamp seduces me, and that’s why I’ve tried to rescue those icons of a
bygone technology which opened up our senses and taught us to see the world and
art in new ways. Vinyl LP’s, VHS tapes, cassettes, books and magazines: I take
these and transform them into photographic and video installations, trying to
recover the essence they conveyed to me, making them over into new items which
are not what they seem.
Mix – that is the basis of Post
Dembow Tempo: seeing how we deny one culture that dances with another, at
the same time reaffirming a common past, where it is our job to rediscover them
and tell new stories. Stores which I prefer to be not so much realistic as
derived from the mixture that characterizes our island: a Dembow recomposed and
deconstructed somewhere between the Absurd and the post-conceptual.
What We Need
In order to make this exhibition a reality we need $5,
300, to cover the costs of:
· 
Photographic prints
· 
Frames
· 
Construction and
metalwork for the installations
· 
Wardrobe for the
performance
· 
Performance artists
· 
Musicians
· 
Catering at the
opening event
· 
Transportation of the
works from my studio in Samana
· 
Video documentation
of the performance
The success of this project depends on our achieving
the goal. Some items were excluded in order to avoid having too high a budget
that would frustrate our expectations. However, we will be flexible with our
goals and adapt our proposal to the final amount raised. Hopefully, your
contributions will exceed the initial goal and allow us to realize this project
as it was originally conceived.
What You Get
I do believe one can be an artist and make a living
through self-management. Some of the items from the installations – photographs,
collage, objects – will also become part of the recompense for your support. I
hope you like them.
All our sponsors will receive a PDF of Post Dembow Tempo, a book of
photographs.
Other Ways You Can Help
All your contributions are welcome. You can also help by sharing this
campaign with friends and associates on your social network.
Many thanks for your interest and for your immeasurable help.

<p>My name is Heidi Wood and I am an artist in Bellingham, Washingon. I paint abstracts and landscapes mostly, using acrylic and oils  I started painting late in life and found such joy in it that I wanted to share the experience with others.</p>
<p>Finger painting seemed an ideal way to introduce non-painters to painting. We poured liquid paint on paper and watched it make beautiful shapes. Those who tried it were amazed with their creativity.  I was delighted at the effect it  had  on people. It seemed to put them in the ""zone "" and remove their stress. We need this so badly in our stressful world. It is so much fun. I want to get out in their community and share this experience with everyone.</p>
<p><strong>FINGER PAINTING FOR GROWNUPS</strong></p>
<p>As George Bernard Shaw said ""We don't stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing."" We launched Finger Painting for Grownups in order to offer adults a rejuvenating experience: finger painting as we did as children, but with food, drink and socializing with other like minded adults.  There is something about the classes that feels almost magical.  The participants leave feeling lighthearted, energized and pleased with their hitherto unrealized creativity.</p>
<p>There is very little instruction, no rules and it's impossible to make a mistake. Participants are provided with high quality paint and paper and are encouraged to experiment with color and techniques. Each class starts with participants doing individual paintings and then progressing to doing a painting with one other person. The final painting is done by all the participants combined. Because of the teamwork involved, our classes are ideal as team building exercises at workplace conferences and staff retreats.</p>
<p>One of the ways we will use this money is to enable us to donate finger painting sessions for worthy causes, such as women's shelters  or transition houses.</p>
<p>We also a fun and original activity for events such as baby showers, bridal showers, birthdays, family reunions and anything else that groups of people get together to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>Did I mention as well as the benefits, it is so much fun.</p>

 Textiles Are A Universal Language! Textiles Cross Barriers! Textiles Keep Tradition Alive!This fall I have an opportunity to return to India, where I will be participating in a 2 month residency - D.I.S.C. the Art Textile Program “LINK. The never ending thread”.  The trip will take place October and November of 2017 in the state of Odisha. The participants will include both international and Indian textile artists. I hope I can count on your support!In the state of Odisha thousands of weavers inhabit remote villages living with age old traditions, creating beautiful textiles in cotton and silk. Each region has a distinct style, most well known are the ikat fabrics produced for saris, bed covers and table linens. During this textile program we will travel together to rural villages meeting the master artisans who produce the backbone of traditional Odian art – textiles. This journey is about art, people, how art connects us, it is about experiencing the joy of simple living and about stepping out of our comfort zone. It is about expressing ideas through textile techniques, materials and concepts. It is all about sharing and collaboration!""During the introductory journey to the traditional Odian textile artists will visit five places known for the traditional textile. Artists will stay three – four days at each place to gain more knowledge and understanding about the particular form of textile, and meet the masters. Also artists will see the life cycle of textile. Not only this, they may enjoy the simple way of living in rural Odisha, to enjoy the life style of the textile masters and share some time together. After 25 days of textile journey artists will move to the base camp of the residency where they will work on their concepts for five days. When the concepts will be ready and finalized artists could start working on the particular bodies of art work. At the very end of the program the exhibition of the creative collaboration will be organized at Bhubaneswar. "" (D.I.S.C.

<h3>About me and my Fundraiser!</h3> <p>Hello, my name is Desirae. I have been a crafter since I can remember. I have always donated my hand made wares to others and charitable groups as I have often made more items than I could personally use. Since November 2014, I have been unemployed. Having applied to many jobs and having no luck, I have decided to bring my passion of color and ceramics to others and start my own business as a means to support my family. I have made 3 sales so far in the last two weeks, but I'm not able to produce the inventory I need to be successful fast enough or at a cost that is profitable because I do not have my own kiln.  I also would love to share my craft with others through lessons and donate my services to schools in my local area by hosting free ceramic classes to those that can not afford to learn about this wonderful art form, and eventually open my own studio.  At this time I am driving 20 minutes away and paying someone else to fire my pieces. This has reduced my profit to pennies on the dollar. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Please feel free to visit my shop on Etsy @ <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/DabaDos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.etsy.com/shop/DabaDos</a></p>
<p>I have been working very hard on marketing and designing a logo. I receive $168.00 a week from unemployment and I have only a few dollars each week to put towards this venture. I know that I can be successful with your help and in return I am offering custom pieces to say thank you. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What I need:</p>
<p>A new kiln cost $2343.00 w/o tax. The stilts and posts that I would need
 to operate the kiln cost around $300.00 and the estimate for an 
electrician to install it is $300.00. Total cost $3000.00 - all the money I receive will go towards this. If I do not reach my goal then any funds I receive will be split 50% towards glaze and inventory to make more pieces and 50% saved for a kiln. So either way all funds will go to help me fund my dream of selling my unique pieces. <br/></p>
<br/> Because you are funding a kiln so that I can provide for my family and start my business, I would like to thank you by creating a unique piece for you. I specialize in unique, hand painted functional pieces. I produce plates, mugs, bowls, and many more pieces that are just as beautiful as they are functional. <br/><br/>
<p>Where will this money go anyway?</p> <ul>
<li>All of the money will go to purchase and setup a kiln. <br/>
</li>
<li>Any
 money that goes over the goal amount will go towards marketing my Etsy store, glazes, and supplies. </li>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>By helping me purchase a kiln, you will provide me with the means to do the following:<br/><br/>* Provide for my family<br/>* Become profitable and successful doing something I love<br/>* Allow me to share my love of art and ceramics with others through their purchases<br/>*Provide classes and teach children about art and ceramics<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Even if I can not fund the entire amount, I<i> need </i>a kiln to 
continue making my art and design. So I will be purchasing one one way 
or another. This fundraiser will help me get it quicker. All art does 
take time to create, so once this fundraiser has taken off, I will begin 
work on the Perks based on the order that people donated. </p>
<p>Please Note: The cost of shipping will also dictate when I am able to ship your item. I will only be able to mail a few pieces each week due to the cost of shipping. You can contact me directly with any questions @ dabados@partypaintsohio.com<br/></p>

<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>My History Professionally, I am a writer, author, life coach, and motivational speaker. My special focus is with people who suffer from bipolar disorder and depression; teaching people to always find the silver lining even in the darkest days. Life can be hard, but it can also be beautiful, powerful, colorful and inspiring! We just need a reminder sometimes. I have a non-profit organization called “Making Blue Happy” that focuses on making more people aware of bipolar disorder, as well as depression. I provide life coaching for individuals who are suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, sufferers of abuse, and a number of other types of coaching.</p>
<p><b>About Yours Truly, Jo</b></p>
<p>I have also started my own greeting card line called “Yours Truly, Jo” that is targeted to individuals who do not know what to say to their friends and family who suffer from the effects of bipolar disorder and depression. My greeting cards and wall art are created especially for friends and family that struggle with bipolar/depression. It’s the perfect way to give your loved ones that extra burst of happiness they need to push forward through the rough times. I am happiest when I am helping people find happiness in life and I have dedicated my life to helping others.</p>
<p><b>What inspired the business?</b></p>
<p>No matter how much I would speak at an event or have a life coaching session, I found that people do better in life with daily reminders or something tangible to give daily encouragement. It is harder for people with bipolar disorder or depression to deal with daily setbacks and we need a little more encouraging and boosting than others. As a person who has suffered from them both almost all my life and not having anyone know what to say to me or how to help me, I have created the right words...words that will stick. As a mother of a child with ￼autism and schizophrenia, I know that sometimes parents raising a child with mental illness can use daily encouragement as well.</p>
<p><b>My Vision</b></p>
<p>Imagine a family member, long time friend of the family, or even yourself. Just think of someone who is suffering through life with a mental illness. It can be hard to manage at times. Imagine them finding strength and peace that they never knew they had. Imagine him or her being able to wake up each day face whatever they are going through and “Smile Anyway! I want this movement to go global and in order to do so; I need backers to help fund my campaign. My greeting cards and canvas art has the potential to change lives daily, who knows it may help someone in your family as well. It is my calling in life to inspire people around the world suffering from bipolar/depression. With the help from you, families will finally have the right words to say when dealing with mental illnesses.</p>
<p><b>The Funds are For</b></p>
<p>There are quite a few things I need in order to get this off the ground including: ￼• My registered TM • A high definition commercial printer • A quality screen printing machine • PR and advertising ￼The TM requires me hiring an attorney, as the process can be complicated, especially with my own design. The cost could range from $350-$1000. The commercial printer will be expensive. It could be as costly as $10,000 or more, but I have a found a few used/smaller models for $3000, A quality screen printing machine will run at least $2500 and again I don’t have to get brand name. I can find a cheaper model to start. Last but not least, PR and advertising will run me between $2000 to $10000, I will get what I am able to afford the campaign. I am the face of my brand and my story sells the brand, so I will definitely need PR.  </p>
<p><b>My stretch goal is $18,000</b>. </p>
<p>With that, I would be able to fund the registered trademark, the desktop computer, and the commercial printer, The screen printing machine and PR outright. More so, there could be funds left for additional materials always needed; paper, inks, envelopes, etc.</p>
<p><b>A Genuine Thank You</b></p>
<p>I really appreciate you taking the time to read about my pursuit, and in aiding in making my dreams become a reality. I have fused two long-time passions of mine, and I am brilliantly aware this is the route I am ready to take to fulfill my passions. I would really love your help with this endeavor! Thank you.

<p>When you talk about mental illness it is still a subject that a lot of people are afraid to talk about and really dig deep in.

<h3>I'm a <a href=""www.davidofficerphotography.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.davidofficerphotography.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">photographer and sound artist</a>, living in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire and I want to create a beautiful portrait of a much-loved woodland. </h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Dunnottar Woods is sometimes referred to as ""Stonehaven’s back garden"", a much-loved community woodland on the edge of the town. On any day you can meet old friends walking dogs, young couples taking a stroll, families playing and a diverse range of wildlife from common garden birds to buzzards and deer. Artist David Officer is documenting a year in the life of this vital woodland, from Spring through to the end of Winter; creating a portrait of a community both wild and human. Intimate studies of woodpeckers and grey heron, time-lapse footage of the trees shedding their leaves in autumn and all mixed with the voices of the people who walk the woods every day in all the weather north-east Scotland can muster. </i></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We need to raise £2000 to ensure completion of this exciting project, leading to an exhibition in the woods themselves and an extensive archive of material documenting the living history of Dunnottar Woods. By supporting this project you'll be directly helping to create a vital document of our living history in north-east Scotland, preserving it's use for future generations. </span>
</div><div>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I'll be creating a rich portrait of the woodland by taking intimate photographs of the wildlife, fauna and people that spend their time there; creating a sound map of the woods and recording the voices and stories which spring from the trees; and collecting mementos of my time there as the woods change with the seasons. The result will be an in depth look at a much-loved woodland in Stonehaven and a stunning exhibition held in the woods themselves.</span></div>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We've already secured the support of Forestry Commission Scotland who own Dunnottar Woods, they will provide some logistical support and vital knowledge of the woods themselves. </span></div> </div> <div> <h3>How much money do we need to make this happen?</h3>
<div>This crowdfund is to raise £2000 to go towards the costs of undertaking and completing the project. The bulk of which I'm hoping to fund through Creative Scotland funding and corporate sponsorship. The total budget for the project is currently £16, 660.</div>
<div>With full funding for the project, I'll be committing 18 hours a week for 48 weeks to document a year in the life of the woods. This time will include all artistic practice, administration and promotion. Calculating this time at a £10 living wage amounts to £8640.</div>
<div>Other costs include essential equipment, graphic design, website design and maintenance, exhibition costs, other promotion and a small contingency fund.</div>
<div>If the only funding we get is from this Indiegogo page then the project can still go ahead but I will be working for free. That means I might not be able to spend as much time on the project as I hoped, simply because I might have to take on some more paid jobs so that I can eat. The scope of the project will still be huge though and the money from raised here will allow us to have a website, buy essential equipment like a camera trap for capturing images of shy wildlife and holding an exhibition in the woods themselves. Without any funding though, there is no project.</div>
<div>As a thank you for your support, there's an exciting perks package for you to choose from:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>1 on 1 photography lesson in Dunnottar Woods</li>
<li>Guided tour of the woods</li>
<li>Guided tour of Stonehaven featuring Dunnottar Woods, Dunnottar Castle, the historic harbour, Cowie and Skatie Shore. Followed by a drink on the harbour wall</li>
<li>A very ltd handmade book featuring images from the project and a usb stick full of digital images and sounds</li>
<li>Photographic prints that feature in the project</li>
<li>If You Go Down to the Woods Today... CD in handmade woodland theme cover</li>
</ul></div> <p>If we don't reach the goal then the project will still go ahead provided all other funding has been achieved. In the event that there is a critical lack of other funding then the project may be cancelled and indiegogo funding returned.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>My background and expertise</h3> <p>I graduated from Aberdeen College in 2006 with an HND in Professional Photography and have been developing my practice over the last 7 years including a stint as a studio photographer for a major family portrait company. My passion has always been nature photography though. This project allows me to document a woodland close to my heart, exploring the wildlife and recording the stories from the people who use the woods. </p>
<p>Having successfully completed a crowdfunding project in 2013, you can have confidence that I'll deliver on the project goals and perks. That project was a major commission for the Fram Museum in Oslo which resulted in a performance at an opening event attended by the King and Prime Minister of Norway. You can have faith that I have experience delivering high quality work to a standard fit for a King. </p>

</div></div>","I'm a photographer and sound artist, living in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire and I want to create a beautiful portrait of a much-loved woodland. 


Dunnottar Woods is sometimes referred to as ""Stonehaven’s back garden"", a much-loved community woodland on the edge of the town. On any day you can meet old friends walking dogs, young couples taking a stroll, families playing and a diverse range of wildlife from common garden birds to buzzards and deer. Artist David Officer is documenting a year in the life of this vital woodland, from Spring through to the end of Winter; creating a portrait of a community both wild and human. Intimate studies of woodpeckers and grey heron, time-lapse footage of the trees shedding their leaves in autumn and all mixed with the voices of the people who walk the woods every day in all the weather north-east Scotland can muster. 
We need to raise £2000 to ensure completion of this exciting project, leading to an exhibition in the woods themselves and an extensive archive of material documenting the living history of Dunnottar Woods. By supporting this project you'll be directly helping to create a vital document of our living history in north-east Scotland, preserving it's use for future generations. 

I'll be creating a rich portrait of the woodland by taking intimate photographs of the wildlife, fauna and people that spend their time there; creating a sound map of the woods and recording the voices and stories which spring from the trees; and collecting mementos of my time there as the woods change with the seasons. The result will be an in depth look at a much-loved woodland in Stonehaven and a stunning exhibition held in the woods themselves.
We've already secured the support of Forestry Commission Scotland who own Dunnottar Woods, they will provide some logistical support and vital knowledge of the woods themselves.    How much money do we need to make this happen?
This crowdfund is to raise £2000 to go towards the costs of undertaking and completing the project. The bulk of which I'm hoping to fund through Creative Scotland funding and corporate sponsorship. The total budget for the project is currently £16, 660.
With full funding for the project, I'll be committing 18 hours a week for 48 weeks to document a year in the life of the woods. This time will include all artistic practice, administration and promotion. Calculating this time at a £10 living wage amounts to £8640.
Other costs include essential equipment, graphic design, website design and maintenance, exhibition costs, other promotion and a small contingency fund.
If the only funding we get is from this Indiegogo page then the project can still go ahead but I will be working for free. That means I might not be able to spend as much time on the project as I hoped, simply because I might have to take on some more paid jobs so that I can eat. The scope of the project will still be huge though and the money from raised here will allow us to have a website, buy essential equipment like a camera trap for capturing images of shy wildlife and holding an exhibition in the woods themselves. Without any funding though, there is no project.
As a thank you for your support, there's an exciting perks package for you to choose from:

1 on 1 photography lesson in Dunnottar Woods
Guided tour of the woods
Guided tour of Stonehaven featuring Dunnottar Woods, Dunnottar Castle, the historic harbour, Cowie and Skatie Shore. Followed by a drink on the harbour wall
A very ltd handmade book featuring images from the project and a usb stick full of digital images and sounds
Photographic prints that feature in the project
If You Go Down to the Woods Today... CD in handmade woodland theme cover
 If we don't reach the goal then the project will still go ahead provided all other funding has been achieved. In the event that there is a critical lack of other funding then the project may be cancelled and indiegogo funding returned.
    My background and expertise I graduated from Aberdeen College in 2006 with an HND in Professional Photography and have been developing my practice over the last 7 years including a stint as a studio photographer for a major family portrait company. My passion has always been nature photography though. This project allows me to document a woodland close to my heart, exploring the wildlife and recording the stories from the people who use the woods. 
Having successfully completed a crowdfunding project in 2013, you can have confidence that I'll deliver on the project goals and perks. That project was a major commission for the Fram Museum in Oslo which resulted in a performance at an opening event attended by the King and Prime Minister of Norway. You can have faith that I have experience delivering high quality work to a standard fit for a King. 
I also work in Marketing and Communications, so I have the expertise needed to ensure the project is promoted successfully, meaning you'll be supporting a successful and exciting project.
    Risks & Challenges There are a number of minor risks associated with this project. The main one being that other sources of funding aren't successful meaning the project would have to be abandoned or changed drastically. The chances of this are slim as I work in the cultural sector and have strong knowledge of constructing funding applications. In the event of any critical failures of funding, I will ensure clear communication with project backers and if the project is cancelled, pledges will be refunded.
I will have photographers insurance in place so equipment failure will only result in a change to timetabled tasks while a replacement is sourced.
The other main risk is that something happens to me which means I am unable to complete the project. Rest assured it would have to be something fairly serious to lead to a project stop. In the event of illness or other incident, I will ensure as much communication with backers as possible but money may not be returned if the project is under way.
    Other Ways You Can Help I understand that not everyone can afford to support an art project.

Introduction: Hello my name is Miguel Hine and I was born in San Jose, Costa Rica.  I moved with my family to the United States at a very young age and currently reside in Key Biscayne, FL. Living in the United States most of my life has allowed me the wonderful opportunity to study Fine Arts and painting at two of the top art schools in the nation, The New World School of the Arts and the Maryland Institute College of Art on full-scholarship.

Campaign Goal: 
I recently was contacted by the Bernard Solco gallery, a prominent art gallery located in New York City. The curator and owner are very interested in my work.

More importantly, we discussed the possibility of myself Artist Miguel Hine being one of four artists exhibiting / represented by this gallery at this year's Artexpo New York April 23rd -26th | Pier 94. Now, the flip side, of course these opportunities don't come free of charge and I would have to raise the funds to travel and participate in a four day exhibit in New York City this coming April. I need your help to make this dream a reality.
Where do your your money go. How can contributors help. There is everything from the gallery fee, to shipping my artwork to NYC.  My Airline air fare fee. Living expensive.  For example a proper place to sleep,  Preferably a hotel, I'm doing my best to reach out to a few friend's in NYC. about sofa option's but they all live kinda far from my Expo / location..

About Coloring Mandalas:
Recently, we took our COLORING MANDALAS project to Loma Linda University Children's Hospital to bring coloring kits to children and families stuck in their hospital rooms and also to color along with us.
A mandala is a spiritual symbol representing the universe. Mandalas can be found in every culture and religion. Coloring Mandalas is way to express hidden parts of yourself and explore the spiritual process as it unfolds with color and texture.
Benefits of mandalas include:1. Relieve tension, anxiety, fear and worry2. Relax and heal the mind, body and spirit.3. Stimulate creative thinking and problem-solving.
It's an ancient art form for all ages!
""Art helps kids to express themselves and not focus so much on the pain"", says Myra Benitez, Manager of Social Work at Loma Linda University Children's Hospital.   What We Need  Each coloring kit includes several mandala coloring sheets, coloring tools (like pencils, crayons or markers) and a postcard insert with how-to directions.
It costs about $5 for each coloring kit. If we reach our goal, we can create 100 coloring kits! 
Our plan is to bring this project to more hospitals, shelters and place there are kids in need. The more money we raise, the more coloring kits we can provide to reach more children so please help us meet and exceed our goal!   The Impact of Art Therapy When you contribute to this campaign, you are helping children in a profound way. Art therapy for children can provide kids with an easier way to express themselves since a young child is likely to be more comfortable expressing him/herself with some crayons and markers, for example, than he/she is going to be at expressing emotions and feelings through words. Art therapy can help children dealing with:


mental health problems
grief and/or loss 
learning disabilities
emotional problems
abuse of any kind
cancer or terminal illness


    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools and tell your friends and family about our campaign!   We Thank You!",0.0,0,"8 Campaigns

<p></p><p>“Da Dee At!” (“Don’t Do It!”) is a performance art festival
set up at the Aberdeen beach.</p>
<p>'Cocking a snook' at the long standing remonstration by
parents of their children at play; at home, in the street, or out somewhere
special – like the beach – this live art/performance project aims to get in
touch (in a constructive way!) with that age-old childish instinct to break the
rule, to try the new, to push at the boundary, to gently challenge the status
quo.</p>
<p>The live art/performance art form is the ideal vehicle for
such an ambitious objective.  It is an
art form unique in its accessibility, to both audience and artist; it is
invariably neither precious, nor intimidating; it does not rely on any one
artistic skill set or prior knowledge by the audience of the same; it takes place
in the moment, of which the audience is an integral part; and it can take place
in locations outside of the normal confines of artistic expression – the
concert hall, the gallery, the museum. Drawing on that, the project’s main goal
is to provide interactive pieces of art which will allow the audience to get
personally and physically engaged and break the elitist concept of the fourth
wall. </p>
<p>A background theme of the project is nostalgia for the past
grandeur and significance of the Aberdeen beach holiday that goes back to the
first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, when Aberdeen was the main summer
holiday destination for the rest of Scotland. 
We believe that an art festival in the form of a late summer, beach
picnic will encourage an informal and energetic atmosphere for the
performances, in which the artists shall be specifically asked to reflect on
their memories of retro beach activities. The project could be viewed as a
small counter to the commercialisation of the beach area in recent years. </p>
<p>The programme would consist of approx. 12 performances, held
over a weekend, and possibly one day either side, including probably some evening performances, at the end of September 2015. 
A base will be established at the beach, located probably in the
vicinity of the bus stops and beach cafes in order to maximise accessibility
and visibility.   Some performances might be located at some distance away, along the beach, in which case transport would be provided for any audience needing it. </p><p>Documentary footage of
the day’s performances will be screened each night – harking back to the era of
the ‘city of silver screens’ - complementing talks and discussion, in a nearby
‘festival pub/café’. </p>
<p>The artists would be selected by the panel after considering
submissions in response to an open invitation to participate.  The invitation and selection would probably
be done on a 2-tier basis – local and outwith Aberdeen – to ensure a fair
representation of local artists as well as to keep costs down. </p>

<div>Hello. I'm a 23 year old artist who smokes the equivalent of 1 pack of cigarettes a day. I currently smoke hand-rolled cigarettes with no filters so that the silicon filter does not impose environmental damage to the world. That said there are lots of cigarette butts that need to be cleaned up. Because, the filters are essentially non-biodegradable, it does not even make sense to throw them in the trash. However, I will start collecting cigarette butts, starting in Minneapolis for a week, and eventually full-time to Chicago for 12 hours a day and I will be using the liter I pick up to make art objects. The grand project will be to reconstruct the Medinah Temple in Chicago with cigarette butts to introduce the Black Swan project. My goal is to donate whatever money I raise to eventually buying the Medinah Temple and restoring it to its original purpose of being a place of worship and contemplation for the community. The Black Swan Project is a literary/artistic project that seeks to establish a space to publish and<span style=""background-color: initial;""> forward t</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">he arts. The newly designed Medinah Temple would house studios, performance venues, offices, and community spaces that would engage the public and support creative individuals.</span>

<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>We need:</p> <ul> <li>$1500 - Covers housing costs for the 5 billed artists. We took the average price from our  wishlist on air b&amp;b. We did include $100 in estimated tax. </li>
<li>$1040 - Covers transportation for the 11 days we will be touring in California. We plan on either renting an SUV from Budget or using our Zip Car Membership. Again, we took the average of the two prices to get what we would be spending on rental and gas for the 11 days we'll be in California. </li>
<li>$275 - Covers food for all artists. We live how we work. This is will allow us to buy food and cook meals for the house while traveling. (none of those meals include alcohol, just FYI)</li>
<li>$500 GoPro Camera, carrying case  &amp; mount to capture the our first outing out West. We'd like to document the trip and performances for future short film footage and fellowship/residency/grant applications. Many grants we apply for want to see what we do, this footage will take us a long way in getting lobg term support!  (feel free to gift us the camera via this link -&gt; <a href=""http://shop.gopro.com/cameras/heroplus-lcd/CHDHB-101.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://shop.gopro.com/cameras/heroplus-lcd/CHDHB-101.html</a> )</li>
<li>$545 cushion for incidentals like the random flat tire or tow, extra tax, outside musician fee,  etc. It's always best to be prepared for what could happen. Just in case our estimates are too low we'd like to be ready.</li>

<p>In the last 4 years since Art LovHer's creation, we've had the opportunity to work with and connect hundreds of women, black, and LGBTQ artists. We are more than an event company, we are an experience. We create an atmosphere that has given numerous voices a sense of validation and security, unfound in day to day society. For that we are grateful, yet, curious. How many more people crave these spaces? Need these spaces? </p>
<p>Being in NYC, I've met and worked with so many people from so many places. A common comment is that the environment of the musical/artistic communities are very different than hat we have here. SO I thought why not take Art LovHer to these places? </p>
<p>I can't begin to describe how incredible it is to see an artist that I presented years ago, tell us how being a feature at an Art LovHer Salon literally launched her artist career. Or how it changed her parents support for her artistry. Or have someone  share his secret in room full of strangers. Sometimes, all people need to be their best and truest self is a little push in the form of a safe space that encourages them to be free. Perhaps Art LovHer is that loving nudge,  for artist and audience alike, to feel safe to share life with each other. We'll never know until we try..  </p>
<p>This is me trying. I have literally put everything I've had into Art LovHer for the last 4 years. At times forgoing the logical choices of others so that the community I want to strengthen can exist for those who need it. For those who are afraid of how powerful they can be. </p>
<p> People often ask me, why pay artists? Or why put myself in debt to help someone else become successful? I still have no answer for that. My best answer is that connecting people is what I know my life's purpose to be. I know that the world has an inherent need for beauty and art in the world. I know that I have done nothing, outside of motherhood, that feels this natural and necessary in this world.

<p>This project is for helping my friend, Kestutis Ptakauskas,
to fund his annual event – “European bonsai and suiseki convention and 4th
Japanese culture festival”</p>
<p><b>Who is Domas?</b></p>
<p>I am an engineer, on my spare time I do voluntary job. I
help to my friends and organizations I belong to organize activities. I started
at youth organization “Business angel” on 2004, and try to do good till now. </p>
<p><b>Why is it important?</b></p>
<p>Kestutis is organizing events to promote Japanese arts and
culture in Lithuania since 2004. I saw how hard it is to collect enough funds
for him. This year we have discussed a lot about the need to organize an event,
when support is so moderate. At first there were a lot of government officials,
who said: “Just bring an event of such scale and of such international
importance and you get your funds from city municipality and national culture funds”.
But at the end, it all is just a promise.</p>
<p><b>Worst case scenario</b></p>
<p>Because of insufficient funds, this event will put my
friend, who is personally responsible, in huge debt, and we have no more such
events in Lithuania ever, where we can touch traditional Japanese culture. This
event will be high quality anyway, but it might be the last one. So I decided
to help with all my knowledge that this would never happen.</p>
<p><b>How much we need?</b></p>
<p>Event’s budget is about 143 100 euro. It consists of:</p>
<p>Venue and exhibition equipment’s rent: 29 000 euro</p>
<p>Administrative costs: 4 200 euro</p>
<p>Expenses for performers, masters, dancers and singers’
meal’s, accommodation and transportation (130 person form Japan and other
countries, 5 nights): 93 300 euro</p>
<p>Publicity, advertising, banners, posters and etc.: 16 600
euro</p>
<p>Already gathered from various sponsors: 22 000 euro</p>
<p>Expecting from event tickets: 15 000 euro</p>
<p>In total, at a given day, we are 106 100 euro short.</p>
<p><b>How much from indiegogo community?</b></p>
<p>Well, it would be totally great to
gather all 100 000 euro (approx 109 000 dollars), to cover the rest of expenses through indiegogo.com, but we
will set our goal to $ 30 000 to see what happens. I hope those who value
Japanese culture will make a miracle.</p>
<p><b>Perks?</b></p>
<p>Check out perks on your right. As an overall perk we are
planting one Sakura tree for every thousand dollars gathered at ""Vilnius
Japanese garden"" (for more information about ""Vilnius Japanese
garden"" project visit <a href=""http://www.vilniausjaponiskassodas.lt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.vilniausjaponiskassodas.lt</a>). The area where

<p><b>Why 'Wear the Blue Bead'?</b></p>
<p>The Blue Glass Dutch Trade Bead was commonly used as currency to buy and sell slaves between the 16th and 20th Century. It is a symbol of a period of time that we had hoped was over but it is not. There are more people enslaved today than during the Middle Passage. Our goal is to amass 21 million individual beads as part of the installation. 21 million is the estimated number of people enslaved in one form or another today. Each bead represents each person, woman and child who continue to suffer.</p>

If you want to know why we care so much, please read on...<br/><br/><br/><b>Why it Matters:</b>
<p>There are many reasons that people do art. For us, it's personal. For instance, slavery is not a 'passage' in history for me or my family. Good guys and bad. I was raised by slaves. Real slaves. Slavery so horrific that many in my family still cannot talk about it. Some will freely tell you about the horrors of the Japanese Concentration camps or Dutch Repatriation camps. But not their slavery.</p>
<p>My GrandMother was sold at birth, along with a dowry of priceless aluminum to a Mandarin ""Captijn de Chinese"" when she was a baby. Her own father bought 'second daughters' to trade and cement alliances with. My own father was raised by a slave named Poongoo, a black Melanesian woman who raised him, long after she was given her freedom during the revolution.</p>
<div>
<p>Art is complex. What we are creating is not a soundbite or a slogan. It is not a glimpse of the past or a re-imagining of the future. This is not just a picture but a call to action, a pledge to speak out, a provocation and a promise. From All of us.</p>
<p>Today (this very day) there are over twenty-one million slaves. Way more in the last three years than the three hundred year period we call Middle Passage and worse than at any other time in our history. Worse in every way; metric, age, torture, rape, genocide and worse in scope and intensity. The vast majority are women and children and no country is immune. Slavery isn't over or past and we are 'post' nothing when it comes to devaluing human life.</p>
<p>In the 1700's a slave might cost (worldwide) about six hundred dollars. That's about $43,000 US today. Today, the average slave costs about $90.00 US. They are virtually disposable and they are used and used up that way. It is a genocide.</p>
<p>My grandmother's priceless dowry of aluminum became worth nothing overnight when technology was able to extract it from rock. A miracle. What kind of miracle would it take to end modern slavery? What will it take to stop people from buying people? We won't know until we all are aware and can focus our collective strength, influence, power and, mostly, creativity on this horrible crime that is practically invisible.</p>
<p>We would like to make it visible and offer a first step...  we are FOR Freedom. We dont think there is any one answer and we believe as Harriet Tubman did that, </p>
<p><b><i>""Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.""</i></b></p>
<p>This is our dream...</p>
<p>Offer up a single bead, a seed. Wear it on your wrist or neck. Tell your story. This will only end when Empathy replaces Sympathy and Apathy. Wear a bead to remind yourself where your cheap goods come from. Wear a bead to remind yourself that this happens to children from every nation, race, religion or color. Wear a bead so people will ask you why... Then tell them your story.</p>

<p></p>Dreamland is an immersive environment with a kinetic sculpture at its center. It’s an unexpected oasis that disappears and reappears on the horizon, far away from the city streets in deep playa. Its perimeter is delineated by lampposts, kaleidoscopes and large, comfortable benches that provide a space to relax and enjoy an atmosphere of revelry. </div>
<div>As participants interact with the sculpture, they discover that they control the movement of the piece by turning a circular, central railing, which moves the arms above head, imitating the mechanics of a swing carousel. During the day, spinning the sculpture creates shifting patterns of shade and light as the sun filters through a fabric canopy.  A soundscape that echoes the boardwalk and bygone carnivals fades in and out. At night, the atmosphere becomes electrified. As the spinning arms reach different velocities, the piece comes alive with <b>fire and light</b>. <br/>

What is Dreamland? 

Undulating light and carnivalesque music spill across the desert night, beckoning participants to investigate. Bursts of flame punctuate the prismatic glow, seemingly random in duration and intensity. Upon approach, it becomes evident that the light, flame and music are connected parts of a singular attraction. 


Dreamland is an immersive environment with a kinetic sculpture at its center. It’s an unexpected oasis that disappears and reappears on the horizon, far away from the city streets in deep playa. Its perimeter is delineated by lampposts, kaleidoscopes and large, comfortable benches that provide a space to relax and enjoy an atmosphere of revelry. 
As participants interact with the sculpture, they discover that they control the movement of the piece by turning a circular, central railing, which moves the arms above head, imitating the mechanics of a swing carousel. During the day, spinning the sculpture creates shifting patterns of shade and light as the sun filters through a fabric canopy.  A soundscape that echoes the boardwalk and bygone carnivals fades in and out. At night, the atmosphere becomes electrified. As the spinning arms reach different velocities, the piece comes alive with fire and light.

I am...</b></h4><p>Debbie Taylor.</p><h4><b>The Shining Tree Artists in Residence Programme</b></h4><p>Part of my family home is two studios - one of those includes a gallery space, the other is a small off-grid studio and surrounding garden. I call these studios, gallery and garden 'The Shining Tree', the name was inspired by a poem 'when the light shifts' by artist Thomas A. Clark.  The Shining Tree is in a small ancient Cumbrian village called Gilcrux (gil-cruise) meaning 'hill retreat',  the place and community vibe are just beautiful.</p><p>A few years back, my family and friends supported me through a difficult and stressful time, which was when we collectively started to develop The Shining Tree, beginning with the garden - formerly an overgrown wasteland, and studio. For me this was a healing process, but I can't tell you how long I'd dreamed of sharing this space with other artists who need a bit of time and a bit of space and a bit of support to develop their practice. The idea of a somehow transformative space where artists would be well looked after, and left alone when they wanted, just grew from there, and from my own experiences. Since then, we've developed a second studio and gallery, also part of my family home... and I should say at this point, the family home is humble! It's a really small late 16th century cottage very slowly being taken back to its bones. The off-grid studio and garden are a moments walk away, while the second studio and gallery are in an outbuilding adjacent to the cottage. Altogether this is, I think, a place that's really rooted in the rural, with a close relationship to the rest of the county, Scotland and, even, the Scandinavian countries. </p><p>What I can realistically achieve is as follows: </p><p>I want to help support six Cumbrian and Scottish-based graduate artists over a three year pilot project. </p><p>While The Shining Tree is based in Cumbria, the county has a historic, close connection to Scotland. The Shining Tree HQ overlooks the Solway Firth and the southern uplands of Scotland, among others the upland hill Criffel, to the south of Dumfries, is prominent; some describe this as a ""mirror image"" of the fell 'Skiddaw' in the Lake District.</p><p>The idea is that two graduate artists will be invited each summer at particular times to live and work here in the village of Gilcrux. I'm not going to be ageist!  participating graduate artists could be in their 20s, 30s, 40s and beyond. Artists might want to explore the history, heritage and landscape of West Cumbria; its relationship to the coast and wider county of Cumbria and its relationship to the west coast of Scotland, which is nearby, or they might be inspired to explore something completely different. At the end of their residency, at a later date, they will curate and host their exhibitions here at The Shining Tree (the exhibitions could even go on tour, wouldn't that be something.)</p><p>For the first year of The Shining Tree Artists in Residence programme, there are already two participating artists (you'll be hearing more about Helen Tuck and Martin Hill as this campaign develops). I've the studios and materials, a gallery space, IT equipment and support, and have even secured local self-catering accommodation, almost next door to the residency, so that participating artists feel comfortable. Should artists want to spend the odd weekend 'glamping' in the garden, I've got that covered too! So why do I need your help? </p><h4><b>My Fundraising Goal and How You Can Help</b></h4><p>I don't believe that artists should pay to participate in residencies, or that residencies ""should be the privilege of those with means"" (An Xiao @anxiaostudio). I really need your help to award our first two participating artists a residency fee. </p><p>There's a well-developed business plan and campaign strategy, and I've also applied for a small pot of public funding from both local and national organisations; but you'll already know that crowd funding has become necessary for non profits to raise funds in uncertain times. </p><p>Here on Indiegogo I'm asking for £2000 GBP </p><p>I know that transparency is important (and am happy to share some of my Business Plan with you on request.) In a nutsell, though, if I'm successful and are fully funded on Indiegogo, almost all of the funding will be awarded to the two resident artists this first year. </p><p>Some of the funds will also contribute towards subsequent exhibition costs arising as a result of the residencies. </p><h4><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h4><p>•Make some noise about my campaign by mailing your family and friends</p><p>•Use the Indiegogo share tools to promote my campaign on social media</p><p>•Mention the campaign on your websites, your blog posts, interview the artists or me if you fancy! </p><h4><b>Perks</b></h4><p>I've a selection of perks, almost all of them have a connection to this beautiful place and its community.

It gives people from every walk of life a chance to mingle and participate in building and fortifying a healthy culture. A novice may grace the same stage that a veteran professional controlled only a week early. This gives the community the chance to see how it is done and to cut their teeth giving it a shot.</p><p>Counter Culture specializes in <b>art receptions</b> and <b>music events</b>, but it doesn’t end there. Any member of the community may propose an event and work to see it achieved. Writing workshops, social demonstrations, seminars, lectures, yoga, community bike rides, urban planning and so much more, start within the walls of Counter Culture. This is real world application of what is usually only found inside intellectual or academic circles.</p><p><b><i>History</i></b></p><p>The History of Counter Culture the entity is only one year old. But in that short time it has impacted and participated in a burgeoning renaissance. The two facilitators of the venture, Curtis Dalton and Benjamin Champagne, have been involved in the arts for over a decade, but many more have come through to help with 20 plus years. Counter Culture has been around in the hearts of people for centuries. It is more about a movement that is already taking place and the community of Saginaw getting behind it and supporting it. Counter Culture has worked with nationally touring musicians, artists spanning the country, organizations within the city, high school students and nearly everything in between. It doesn’t matter what demographic you find yourself in, Counter Culture has something for you; Age, Sex, Race, Class does not matter. All can participate together and compose their own meaning.</p><p>During the months of April and May, Counter Culture saw a few thousand inside its doors. All glowing faces and bright smiles. Many lives were touched and enhanced. Many people learned that they could oversee a project and dream to it’s finish. Unfortunately, due to several conflicts, we were forced to leave the location we were in and find a new home.  As you can see, we have and it’s only a few blocks away from the original site.  We wish to continue that and show the country how cities that suffered from the collapse of industry come back to life.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fcjo4btOSFtw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dcjo4btOSFtw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fcjo4btOSFtw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Students and parents fill the room for a poetry slam featuring students from the Saginaw Arts &amp; Sciences Academy.</i><br/><p></p><p><b><i>What We Need</i></b></p><p>Counter Culture is set to open the new building up to the public very soon. Nothing will stop this, but it would be much better if some last minute odds and ends were tightened up. <b>A good cultural hub can serve as a destination and help to make a city look a little brighter on a map. This is an investment in your community. </b>Imagine if the SVSU students that enrolled from out of town took a great interest in this city!

<p><b>Live Concerts :</b> For years, one of the only ways to get a live concert experience in Saginaw has been by either going to a large arena, or braving the late night (or morning) at a local bar.  What Counter Culture does is provide a safe place for patrons of all ages to experience live, original music up close and personal.  In any given month, dozens of Michigan bands, and a handful of out-of-state, or even out-of-country bands will grace our stage, making it a great place to discover new music, or for our area youth, even play a first show.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Art Exhibitions :</b> Serving as the area's only venue of it's kind, Counter Culture features both local artists, and those from far away; tradional art, as well as the bizaare.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Comedy &amp; Theatre :</b> These avenues of the arts are not only ones for drinking environments.  In the past, Counter Culture was host to a 'comedy game night' similar to ""Who's Line Is It Anyway?""  We will move forward with it, stand-up and eventually, theatre!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Health &amp; Fitness :</b> Physical health is just as important to a healthy mind and making/viewing the arts as anything else.  In the past, we have been a host to a yoga class, and were are currently behind a weekly community bike ride.  We will continue both of these activities, and add more in the near future.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Programs For Students :</b> Though we have only served as host to one student function, SASA Soothes The Counter Culture in May 2015, our plan is to expand this part of the organization as much as possible.  Coming months will see us extending our hand to every school in the county, to offer safe after hours activities relating to art, music, literature and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Workshops / Clubs :</b> One of the coolest things about Counter Culture is the wide range of talent that walks through its doors.  Writing, art, and wellness workshops allow the great minds of our community to share their gifts.</p>

</ul><br/></div>","AboutCounter Culture is a Saginaw based Art Gallery and Music Venue, registered as a non-profit in the State of Michigan. With an emphasis on every area in the Humanities, Counter Culture serves as an Art Collective and social hub. It gives people from every walk of life a chance to mingle and participate in building and fortifying a healthy culture. A novice may grace the same stage that a veteran professional controlled only a week early. This gives the community the chance to see how it is done and to cut their teeth giving it a shot.Counter Culture specializes in art receptions and music events, but it doesn’t end there. Any member of the community may propose an event and work to see it achieved. Writing workshops, social demonstrations, seminars, lectures, yoga, community bike rides, urban planning and so much more, start within the walls of Counter Culture. This is real world application of what is usually only found inside intellectual or academic circles.HistoryThe History of Counter Culture the entity is only one year old. But in that short time it has impacted and participated in a burgeoning renaissance. The two facilitators of the venture, Curtis Dalton and Benjamin Champagne, have been involved in the arts for over a decade, but many more have come through to help with 20 plus years. Counter Culture has been around in the hearts of people for centuries. It is more about a movement that is already taking place and the community of Saginaw getting behind it and supporting it. Counter Culture has worked with nationally touring musicians, artists spanning the country, organizations within the city, high school students and nearly everything in between. It doesn’t matter what demographic you find yourself in, Counter Culture has something for you; Age, Sex, Race, Class does not matter. All can participate together and compose their own meaning.During the months of April and May, Counter Culture saw a few thousand inside its doors. All glowing faces and bright smiles. Many lives were touched and enhanced. Many people learned that they could oversee a project and dream to it’s finish. Unfortunately, due to several conflicts, we were forced to leave the location we were in and find a new home.  As you can see, we have and it’s only a few blocks away from the original site.  We wish to continue that and show the country how cities that suffered from the collapse of industry come back to life.Students and parents fill the room for a poetry slam featuring students from the Saginaw Arts & Sciences Academy.What We NeedCounter Culture is set to open the new building up to the public very soon. Nothing will stop this, but it would be much better if some last minute odds and ends were tightened up. A good cultural hub can serve as a destination and help to make a city look a little brighter on a map. This is an investment in your community. Imagine if the SVSU students that enrolled from out of town took a great interest in this city! Imagine a town full of people happy, content and producing with one another. One movement like Counter Culture is all it takes to help adjust the tone for an entire community.Our biggest supports and resources are the people that have helped us along the way, or at least have come to see what all the noise is about, but unfortunately, a necessary piece of this puzzle is funding.  We have already sunk tens of thousands of our own dollars into this venture, and we only need a little more help to get all the way there.  Small contributions add up, and the dreams of many come true.TimelineThere is no time like the present and we like to illustrate that in our work habits and deadlines. It’s a carpe diem attitude that we admire in all the greats before us. We have much of the help we need to make everything happen, now we need community support in the form of voting with dollars.  While some of this budget is needed immediately, other parts of it will benefit the small artistic community we’ve gathered in the coming months.Hundreds of fans enjoy a concert in the former gallery room.BudgetUntil the move, we had never been ones to ask for handouts or beg for help, but in the last few months, humility has….  Counter Culture is our dream, and we get an immense amount of satisfaction out of providing it to our community, but we are only two young adults.  This entire thing has been funded out of own pockets, and with all the recent expenses, we are near financial exhaustion.  While Counter Culture has proven to be self-sustaining as an ongoing business, starting up in a new building - that wasn’t exactly move in ready - has taken it’s toll, which is why we are asking for your help over this initial hump.Though the expenses of what is yet to be done will probably double or triple what we’re asking for, contributions will definitely help us get there.  Here’s a small breakdown of our campaign goal, and how funds raised will be distributed.$1,500 - Upgrading to an industry standard, quality live sound and lighting system to provide an incredible experience for both performers and audience.$1,500 - Framing, Electrical Work, Plumbing, Permitting, including the build out of a retail space, a sound booth, a concessions area and more.  A big part of this expense is also making sure we are fully ADA / Handicap compliant.$500 - In order to let people know we exist, we need a decent, lighted sign.  The name Counter Culture deserves to SHINE!$500 - The new building is great, but for the look a true gallery really needs, it needs a fresh coat of paint or two, inside and out.  Help us with a few dozen gallons.$500 - Annual dancehall license, master business license, and legal and filing fees towards converting into a 501c3 non-profit organization.$1,000 - Programming for youth (as well as adults) like art classes and workshops, music lessons/get togethers and more are so important to us.  Help us make these possible and frequent.Any funds raised in excess of our goal will go toward additional programs involving local schools, youth and the effort to keep the doors of Counter Culture open, as a community ‘safe place’, regularly.These are some of the things we do:
Live Concerts : For years, one of the only ways to get a live concert experience in Saginaw has been by either going to a large arena, or braving the late night (or morning) at a local bar.  What Counter Culture does is provide a safe place for patrons of all ages to experience live, original music up close and personal.  In any given month, dozens of Michigan bands, and a handful of out-of-state, or even out-of-country bands will grace our stage, making it a great place to discover new music, or for our area youth, even play a first show.

Art Exhibitions : Serving as the area's only venue of it's kind, Counter Culture features both local artists, and those from far away; tradional art, as well as the bizaare.

Comedy & Theatre : These avenues of the arts are not only ones for drinking environments.  In the past, Counter Culture was host to a 'comedy game night' similar to ""Who's Line Is It Anyway?""  We will move forward with it, stand-up and eventually, theatre!

Health & Fitness : Physical health is just as important to a healthy mind and making/viewing the arts as anything else.  In the past, we have been a host to a yoga class, and were are currently behind a weekly community bike ride.  We will continue both of these activities, and add more in the near future.

Programs For Students : Though we have only served as host to one student function, SASA Soothes The Counter Culture in May 2015, our plan is to expand this part of the organization as much as possible.  Coming months will see us extending our hand to every school in the county, to offer safe after hours activities relating to art, music, literature and more.

Workshops / Clubs : One of the coolest things about Counter Culture is the wide range of talent that walks through its doors.  Writing, art, and wellness workshops allow the great minds of our community to share their gifts.

Dream Factory : It’s title may sound silly, but this is one of our favorite parts of the entire collective.  In creating Counter Culture, all we were doing taking our ideas and turning them into reality.  We didn’t ask for [much] help, we didn’t ask for anyone’s permission, and we didn’t let obstacles, big or small, get in our way.  The ‘just do it’ mentality of Counter Culture is an exercise in both creativity and confidence.  We want to show people that when you put your mind and heart to something, you can accomplish it!  That being said, one of the missions of Counter Culture is to stimulate, encourage and nurture this line of thinking; helping others to bring their ideas to life whenever possible.During the brief time we were open, we made a little bit of noise in the local media.  See for yourselves :Print Press

Hello!  
I am Jeanne LaVallee, the Founder and
Director of Apple Village Arts, a
non-profit Afterschool Studio Art Program for children in the East
Village.  I am a professional Artist,
Writer, a licensed Educator with three decades of teaching experience. AVA is a lean operation with one employee and
a small board of trustees.  I write to
present this campaign to grow Apple Village Arts, which has been serving
children in the Lower East Side since the Spring of 2010.
Any funds you may offer for AVA will
be used for one or more of the following:
●rental of studio space 
●art supplies
●employee salary and health insurance 
●course tuition aid
●art show expenses (hardware, catering services)
●daily snack
●occasional museum admissions fees
Perks: 

$50
donation: Hand silk-screened AVA (or
other design) tee shirt.
$100
donation:  Complimentary Studio Art Class
(for a child, ages 4 to 12).
$500
or more donation:  Original watercolor painting
or print by Jeanne LaVallee.
AVA
has been offering affordable studio art instruction for children, ages 4 to 12,
in the East Village for over four years. 
And each year, AVA—in conjunction with the local café, Ciao for Now—has presented a children’s
art show during the first month of Spring. 
This year, AVA will hold an additional exhibition in the Fall, in
celebration of Hallowe’en. 
The mission of AVA is manifold:
•to
expand children’s visual vocabulary by studying shape, line, color and positive
and negative space, and how these elements interact with each other to affect
our senses;  •to teach Composition and
Design techniques;  •to teach techniques
in the following genres: Portraiture, Landscape Painting, Figure Drawing,
Abstraction, Still Life Drawing/Painting, Drawing from (some) Nature, Collage,
Papier Mâché, and Bookmaking; •to expose
students to a variety of art-making media: 
pencil, charcoal, pastel, pen & ink, colored pencil, crayon,
watercolor, tempera, acrylics, silk screen, as well as scissors, glue, yarn,
string;
•to
allow students’ dreams to become realized; •to develop appreciation for the
works of both the Masters and one’s classmates made in many different styles; •to
empower students by offering them a place to exhibit (and possibly sell) their
work.
Risks and challenges:
Without financial stability, the challenges involved in operating an afterschool
art progam are many; though the primary challenge is to secure affordable and suitable
studio space in the East Village, as the rental fees are prohibitive.  Your support would allow that security of
knowing that AVA would be able to meet this challenge.


Other Ways to Contribute:
If you are not able to contribute funds, there are some other ways that you
can help AVA:

•Donate ART SUPPLIES:  paper (all
types), paints (tempera, acrylic, watercolor), canvas or canvas boards, brushes,
ink, pencils, markers, colored pencils, crayons.
•Donate SNACK items:  crackers, corn chips, fruit, etc.  No sugar, please.
•Offer a WORKSHOP:  if you are a

a demonstration for AVA Students.

My name is Renata Machýčková, I am visual artist and art director of a new gallery project, that I want to implement in the center of 
Bergamo in Italy.

Goal of Lab Gallery is to support young and emerging artists and bring to the city a new artistic vibrancy and potential. Through regular presentations, exhibitions and publishing to allow young artists and students of art schools the opportunity to promote a functioning art market and thus contribute to their independent professional development. Another motivation is to establish contacts with artists and designers from abroad and apply their work in the new environment.
The gallery opening will be a clear example of collaboration between artists and students from art and design field. Moreover they will be able to participate at the gallery space with their own visual contents. We hope to have many exhibitions and events in this space! Your contribution goes towards building a foundation for an ongoing, artistic endeavor. We aim to exhibit new and exciting work, arrange panel discussions, invite guest curators and other. So help us to open our doors as soon as possible!

<b><br/></b>
<p>RED NOSES has been working since 2005 in a region of the world
where laughter is unexpected, but desperately needed: in Palestine. It
started as a pilot project and became a regular programme in 2012. In the local
hospitals, the emotional support provided to patients unfortunately often lags
far behind basic medical care. In addition, relatives are often unable to
regularly visit their family members in hospital due to the restrictions to the
freedom of movement. A visit from RED NOSES clowns greatly helps to improve the
emotional state of patients and is often able to convey to children a sense of
security and joy of life. The apolitical and non-religious stance of the clown
character makes it possible for clowning to help immensely, especially for
children, in overcoming fear and trauma. Like all other RED NOSES clowns, the clown
doctors in Palestine attended many workshops, where they were trained as experts
in hospital clowning. Through their efforts, the young artists now have a
regular source of income. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Teamwork, creativity, motivation, self-assurance and, not least,
the enriching feeling of being able to give something back to their society,
strengthen the self-confidence of the clown doctors The therapeutic clown is
dedicated to developing and promoting practical and productive coping
strategies in the health environment by concentrating on the scientifically
proven health benefits of humour. When clowns work with patients, they
take their individual needs and interests into consideration. This results
in a special connection between patient and artist. The patient’s response is
an elevation of mood coupled with laughter. Laughter - a profound key to
regaining balance and being able to cope. The simple sound of laughter ringing
out with joy and vitality is a signal of hope – all over the world.<br/></p>

Together let us raise 10,000 USD to secure the program until the end of the year.For more information on Red Noses Clowndoctors Palestine: http://www.rednosespalestine.comThank you for your generous contribution.About us:

RED NOSES has been working since 2005 in a region of the world
where laughter is unexpected, but desperately needed: in Palestine. It
started as a pilot project and became a regular programme in 2012. In the local
hospitals, the emotional support provided to patients unfortunately often lags
far behind basic medical care. In addition, relatives are often unable to
regularly visit their family members in hospital due to the restrictions to the
freedom of movement. A visit from RED NOSES clowns greatly helps to improve the
emotional state of patients and is often able to convey to children a sense of
security and joy of life. The apolitical and non-religious stance of the clown
character makes it possible for clowning to help immensely, especially for
children, in overcoming fear and trauma. Like all other RED NOSES clowns, the clown
doctors in Palestine attended many workshops, where they were trained as experts
in hospital clowning. Through their efforts, the young artists now have a
regular source of income. 



Teamwork, creativity, motivation, self-assurance and, not least,
the enriching feeling of being able to give something back to their society,
strengthen the self-confidence of the clown doctors The therapeutic clown is
dedicated to developing and promoting practical and productive coping
strategies in the health environment by concentrating on the scientifically
proven health benefits of humour. When clowns work with patients, they
take their individual needs and interests into consideration. This results
in a special connection between patient and artist. The patient’s response is
an elevation of mood coupled with laughter. Laughter - a profound key to
regaining balance and being able to cope. The simple sound of laughter ringing
out with joy and vitality is a signal of hope – all over the world.

<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>Hello I am Chris Mosley,  a senior studying Scientific Glass Technology at Salem Community College.  Salem offers the only degree program for Scientific Glass in the country. Upon completion I will receive an Associates Degree in Applied Science. Since I started blowing glass in 2011 the equipment and studio was always rented. I have not had the means to own my equipment or have a space to create with glass. Even when given space in a friends garage I still had to borrow tools and equipment.  Also I was limited in time to use the space due to having to wait till my friend was at home to have access. <br/>When I  graduate in May 2016 I  will no longer have access to the college facilities and equipment. I  have been successful in getting orders that need to be fulfilled.  However,  I  will need to have a space and equipment of my own to create my Glassworks . I'm ready to devote full time on my own.</p>
<p>With your support I will be able to run my own flame working studio. Your contribution will allow me to have equipment,  supplies and space needed for a full time studio.</p> </span><br/>

<h3>Contact me</h3>
<div>I'm an artist to the fullest and I just like making cool things people enjoy.

I am a very versatile person and I am willing to work with you on your unique piece. None of the design are set in stone so feel free to ask question about any of the perks. The better the communication the better your perk is going to look when it show up to your home. </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<h3>If I don't reach my goal</h3>
<div>I will continue using my school facilities and renting time at others studios. But no matter what I get i'm still going to spend the money on flameworking equipment and make all of the people who helped fund this project items. Glass is my life so i'm going to always keep moving forward with this medium. I've had to hustle my whole life and nothing is going to stop me from my dreams. </div>

<p>With your help I will be able to become self employed and start my own studio. I believe Americans creating small businesses in arts and craft is a real positive moment in this country and in the world in general. I will be able to share my passion to others, maybe even one day down the road, be able to teach small classes to our youth and start a art school. </p>
<p>I think this is the path to rebuild this economy, skilled people becoming entrepreneur and sharing their craft with the people who appreciated hand crafted goods and them having a real producer, customer relationship and working together. </p>
</div><div> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/></p>
<p>Everything is ready to go, I have the space and i'm blowing glass everyday at school. I just need to order the equipment and can start filling orders and move into the next stage of my life. I've already spend countless funds on classes at crafts schools and will be getting my degree in May for glass. It's time for a change and make a living doing something I love. I've had to hustle and work really hard to just make it this far and I'm sure more obstacles will continue. I wouldn't trade this life for anything else, I love blowing glass and can easily see myself doing this until I grow old and would love to pass this ancient old trade down to my children whenever I have any.   </p>

The Space: The current place I'm living in Salem, New Jersey has an area that I will be able to set up a small studio that is part of my rent. However when I graduate I would like to move into a commercial space because of marketing and flexibility purposes, plus it's just more professional.  Rent of a commercial space ranging from $400-850/mo.



The rest:  The funds will be used to build my bench and  other stands and shelves to keep my studio organized and properly setup in order to be able to work efficiently. So wood, metal, screws and hinges plus others will have to be bought.



The Perks and rewards for helping fund this project
First off each piece of art will be created by me and only me. Each one will have it's own unique personality to it. I will be using borosilicate glass to make all my items. I am not a production artist, it's more about being able to create quality, unique art work for those who enjoy hand crafted objects. Each piece will not look like the next and I will make sure each one has it's own personality but still look like the pictures presented below. 

1. Mozeart Designz Sticker: est size 3x4 in. 10 + shipping



Designed by Chris Mosley, Illustrated by Brian Prince.

2. Implosion Pendant: est. size .5x1 in. $30 + shipping

You can pick from dot implosion (on left) or frit implosion (on right). Colors will be listed. 

3. Mens/Women glass Cufflinks: est. size 12mm. $50/pair + shipping









4. Phoenix Pendants: est. size 5x4 in. $60 + shipping

You will be able to pick two colors and loop style (showing in bottom right and top right) to make your own unique hand crafted Phoenix. 

5. Glass Spiders: est. size 3x3 in. $75 + shipping 



You will be able to pick two different colors to custom create your spider.




6. Pocket Monster: est. size fits in hand nicely. $200 + shipping (smoking functional) I will also throw in a Mozeart Designz Sticker




You will be able to choose from one color (on left) or two color not shown) or frit which is a striking color, meaning it changes colors depending on the amount of heat I put on it (on right). This item is super customizable. 

7. Inner Fire (Neon structure): est. size 18x9 in. $500 + shipping I will also include any perk 1-5 and a Mozeart Design Sticker


This piece interacts with your bodies energy field and your touch. 

8. Custom Order for your birthday and Christmas, two orders a year for 3 years + any perk 1-6 or under $200. This Perk is $1,000 + shipping


Starting in 2016-2019 I will make you one custom object of your choice within my skill level for your birthday and Christmas for the next 3 years. 
You also get to pick one perk under $200 on the list above.
Lets create something cool together.


Contact me
I'm an artist to the fullest and I just like making cool things people enjoy. So please contact me if you see something you like but might want to change the color, or just want it to look kinda different. I am a very versatile person and I am willing to work with you on your unique piece. None of the design are set in stone so feel free to ask question about any of the perks. The better the communication the better your perk is going to look when it show up to your home. 


If I don't reach my goal
I will continue using my school facilities and renting time at others studios. But no matter what I get i'm still going to spend the money on flameworking equipment and make all of the people who helped fund this project items. Glass is my life so i'm going to always keep moving forward with this medium. I've had to hustle my whole life and nothing is going to stop me from my dreams. 


 The Impact
With your help I will be able to become self employed and start my own studio. I believe Americans creating small businesses in arts and craft is a real positive moment in this country and in the world in general. I will be able to share my passion to others, maybe even one day down the road, be able to teach small classes to our youth and start a art school. 
I think this is the path to rebuild this economy, skilled people becoming entrepreneur and sharing their craft with the people who appreciated hand crafted goods and them having a real producer, customer relationship and working together. 
 Risks & Challenges
Everything is ready to go, I have the space and i'm blowing glass everyday at school. I just need to order the equipment and can start filling orders and move into the next stage of my life. I've already spend countless funds on classes at crafts schools and will be getting my degree in May for glass. It's time for a change and make a living doing something I love. I've had to hustle and work really hard to just make it this far and I'm sure more obstacles will continue. I wouldn't trade this life for anything else, I love blowing glass and can easily see myself doing this until I grow old and would love to pass this ancient old trade down to my children whenever I have any.

<p>We
have all been historically affected by migration and each in different ways. In the Caribbean migration is deeply rooted in our history with loss, displacement, trauma, violence and in modern times it is marred by longing for either 'a better life' or 'origin'.

<p>In celebration of the five year anniversary of the first Twitch Bob Ross marathon, they will once again run an eight day long “The Joy of Painting” marathon starting October 29! The marathon and our campaign extension will run until November 5.</p>
<p>Minnetrista has something special planned for when we meet the $25,000 mark – all fans who make a donation, from $5 to $2,500, will be included in the “Fan Brush Club” in the Bob Ross Experience. We will create a “TV Guide” to be included in the late 80’s living room, and ALL donors will be included as a “Fan of Bob Ross.” Help bring Bob home to the WIPB TV Studio where it all started, and be remembered as a fan (brush) of Bob Ross. All fans that claim a perk with the Limited Edition T-shirt will receive free admission to the Bob Ross Experience from October 29, 2020 - October 29, 2021 when wearing the shirt.  (*Update - Unfortunately, we did not make our mark of $25,000 so these additional perks were not earned.)</p>
<p>Bob Ross inspired generations of viewers with only his soft-spoken voice and a pallet knife. His message of  compassion creativity continues to reverberate today. And yet there is currently no place fans of Bob Ross can visit to celebrate and honor Bob’s life and legacy. With your help, we are going to change that.</p>

Bob painted for the iconic series out of the historic L.L. Ball home on Minnetrista’s campus from 1983 to 1988. The message Bob promoted of fearless creativity and the need to reinterpret perceived mistakes as “happy little accidents” is something we want to see further amplified in the world today.</p>

<p>2018 Art Fort Lauderdale Preview On Deco Drive (WSVN-7)</p>
</div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><h2>Summary</h2><p>We are the Co-Founders and Creators of Art Fort Lauderdale - ""The Art Fair On The Water"". Living in the great city of Fort Lauderdale, we've traditionally been in the shadows of Miami when it comes to arts &amp; culture, often times forcing us to drive to our neighboring county to the south for ""cool things to do"". After creating the Choose954 social movement in an effort to Cultivate Culture &amp; Community in the Greater Fort Lauderdale area, we wanted to start filling the voids in what we felt was missing in our community from a cultural perspective. </p><p>These voids in arts and culture as affected our community in many ways, from the issues of attracting and retaining top talented in the form of skilled workers, to having opportunities in our creative economy for artists to survive. As a result, this has also driven our local artists &amp; creatives to travel or relocate elsewhere to sell and display their work in an effort to continue pursuing their craft. </p><p>With our city absent of having a major four day art fair (the prevalent global format for art fairs), we wanted to create a super unique experience to put our community on the map as a unique destination to view &amp; interact with art while creating a platform to highlight our talented local artists &amp; creatives.  We are dedicated throughout the year of working to highlight the arts &amp; culture through our Choose954 movement and our other initiatives in an effort to make the Greater Fort Lauderdale area a better place to live, and not just a better place to vacation, because we live here too. Arts &amp; Culture is more than just the play component of ""Live, Work, Play"", and art fairs are more than just another excuse to get outside of one's house to walk around and peruse through art they normally don't get to see in one confined setting. Art Fairs promote diversity, they bring neighbors into dialogue, they increase creativity, and they offer opportunities for civic pride. Ultimately, we need help from the community to produce this event as art festivals are not inexpensive to produce, and with the help not coming from the business community up until this point, we're turning to the Indiegogo Community and philanthropists alike to help us grow and scale this endeavor.</p><p> </p><h2>The Fair</h2><p>So what does this look like? This experience is framed within the context of a 4-day curated art fair that transports attendees on a journey along the famed Intracoastal waterways via water taxi with stops at vacant luxury waterfront properties that feature emerging artists exhibiting various styles and methods of art that reflect the past, the present and the future. <br/> <br/>This destination art fair seeks to highlight the uniqueness of the city and put Fort Lauderdale on the art world map as a premiere location to view, interact with and purchase art along with giving art aficionados, residents and visitors a cultural experience that is memorable, interactive and engaging.</p><p>Viewing art inside confined spaces like convention centers and under tents have become more of a purely commercial and transactional environment that lacks memorable experiences and is void of opportunities for thought, reflection and contemplation.</p><p>Art Fort Lauderdale features independent artists and galleries displaying paintings, sculptures, installations, photographs, films and editioned works of the highest quality at each of the waterfront homes/pavilions.</p><p> </p><h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p>Ultimately, we need monetary support to be able to produce the event. From logistical expenses in the form of the boats we use, to hiring security and cleaning crews, to ticketing systems - it costs money to make events happen. Last year our production costs tallied up to just over $100,000 and that was with us being conservative on our advertising &amp; marketing budgets. We need support to help us with production costs, getting the word out through marketing, and being able to add integral pieces we feel will help bring the fair to the next level like bringing in performance artists and interactive components.</p><p>We've created unique perks for you the supporter to have an even more unique experience in return for your support. From exclusive access to previews to limited edition t-shirts to meet &amp; greets with the artists, we're glad to help connect you to parts of an art fair you might not have ever experienced otherwise in exchange for your support!</p><p>Even if we don't meet our very modest and reasonable goal, we're masters of making a lot out of a little and will still use every dollar wisely to help us bring the fair to the next level.</p><p> </p><h2>The Impact</h2><p>The Recent Arts &amp; Economic Prosperity 5 Report provided evidence that the non-profit arts and culture sector is a significant industry in Broward County—one that generates $414.2 million in total economic activity. This spending —$148.5 million by non-profit arts and cultural organizations and an additional $265.7 million in event - related spending by their audiences—supports 11,078 fulltime equivalent jobs, generates $268.9 million in household income to local residents, and delivers $40.1 million in local and state government revenue. This economic impact study sends a strong signal that when we support the arts, we not only enhance our quality of life, but we also invest in Broward County’s economic well - being.</p><p>With Art Fort Lauderdale being the grandest event of the year culturally for Fort Lauderdale, it serves not only as a catalyst for growth &amp; new ideas, but for economic impact. The week of Art Basel (""Miami Art Week"") generates over $550m in economic impact for one week into their local economy, with Broward County reporting $414m in total economic activity absent a major four day art fair.</p><p>More over, with the minimal barrier to entry we have for local artists to get involved and exhibit, this has created a unique opportunity for artists to showcase their work in ways they've never showcased before, leading to fostering new collectors and sales. Multiple exhibiting artists who frequently thousands to exhibit in Miami without generating sales were pleased to share with us that they preferred our format at a fraction of the cost while generating sales to new collectors. Having grown the fair from 700 attendees the first year to 2000 attendees in our second year, we're excited to have more people get to know about Art Fort Lauderdale so we can make an even greater impact in our community and the art world. Ultimately, we're just trying to make our community a better place to live and create more opportunities for our artists, if you share our vision we'd love to connect with you and discuss further!</p><p> </p><p><strong>e-mail - <a href=""mailto:evans@artftlauderdale.com?subject=Re%3A%20Saw%20Your%20Indiegogo%20Campaign%20and%20am%20interested%20in%20Art%20Fort%20Lauderdale"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">evans@artftlauderdale.com</a></strong></p><p><strong>Website - <a href=""http://www.artftlauderdale.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.artftlauderdale.com</a></strong></p><p><strong>Instagram - <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/artftlauderdale"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.instagram.com/artftlauderdale</a></strong></p><p><strong>Facebook - <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/artftlauderdale"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/artftlauderdale</a></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XAof0Dcj4KA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p></div>","For more information on the fair and Corporate Sponsorship opportunities log on to our website - www.artftlauderdale.com/partners

Arts & Culture is more than just the play component of ""Live, Work, Play"", and art fairs are more than just another excuse to get outside of one's house to walk around and peruse through art they normally don't get to see in one confined setting. Art Fairs promote diversity, they bring neighbors into dialogue, they increase creativity, and they offer opportunities for civic pride. Ultimately, we need help from the community to produce this event as art festivals are not inexpensive to produce, and with the help not coming from the business community up until this point, we're turning to the Indiegogo Community and philanthropists alike to help us grow and scale this endeavor. The FairSo what does this look like? This experience is framed within the context of a 4-day curated art fair that transports attendees on a journey along the famed Intracoastal waterways via water taxi with stops at vacant luxury waterfront properties that feature emerging artists exhibiting various styles and methods of art that reflect the past, the present and the future.  This destination art fair seeks to highlight the uniqueness of the city and put Fort Lauderdale on the art world map as a premiere location to view, interact with and purchase art along with giving art aficionados, residents and visitors a cultural experience that is memorable, interactive and engaging.Viewing art inside confined spaces like convention centers and under tents have become more of a purely commercial and transactional environment that lacks memorable experiences and is void of opportunities for thought, reflection and contemplation.Art Fort Lauderdale features independent artists and galleries displaying paintings, sculptures, installations, photographs, films and editioned works of the highest quality at each of the waterfront homes/pavilions. What We Need & What You GetUltimately, we need monetary support to be able to produce the event. From logistical expenses in the form of the boats we use, to hiring security and cleaning crews, to ticketing systems - it costs money to make events happen. Last year our production costs tallied up to just over $100,000 and that was with us being conservative on our advertising & marketing budgets. We need support to help us with production costs, getting the word out through marketing, and being able to add integral pieces we feel will help bring the fair to the next level like bringing in performance artists and interactive components.We've created unique perks for you the supporter to have an even more unique experience in return for your support. From exclusive access to previews to limited edition t-shirts to meet & greets with the artists, we're glad to help connect you to parts of an art fair you might not have ever experienced otherwise in exchange for your support!Even if we don't meet our very modest and reasonable goal, we're masters of making a lot out of a little and will still use every dollar wisely to help us bring the fair to the next level. The ImpactThe Recent Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 Report provided evidence that the non-profit arts and culture sector is a significant industry in Broward County—one that generates $414.2 million in total economic activity. This spending —$148.5 million by non-profit arts and cultural organizations and an additional $265.7 million in event - related spending by their audiences—supports 11,078 fulltime equivalent jobs, generates $268.9 million in household income to local residents, and delivers $40.1 million in local and state government revenue. This economic impact study sends a strong signal that when we support the arts, we not only enhance our quality of life, but we also invest in Broward County’s economic well - being.With Art Fort Lauderdale being the grandest event of the year culturally for Fort Lauderdale, it serves not only as a catalyst for growth & new ideas, but for economic impact. The week of Art Basel (""Miami Art Week"") generates over $550m in economic impact for one week into their local economy, with Broward County reporting $414m in total economic activity absent a major four day art fair.More over, with the minimal barrier to entry we have for local artists to get involved and exhibit, this has created a unique opportunity for artists to showcase their work in ways they've never showcased before, leading to fostering new collectors and sales. Multiple exhibiting artists who frequently thousands to exhibit in Miami without generating sales were pleased to share with us that they preferred our format at a fraction of the cost while generating sales to new collectors. Having grown the fair from 700 attendees the first year to 2000 attendees in our second year, we're excited to have more people get to know about Art Fort Lauderdale so we can make an even greater impact in our community and the art world. Ultimately, we're just trying to make our community a better place to live and create more opportunities for our artists, if you share our vision we'd love to connect with you and discuss further! e-mail - evans@artftlauderdale.comWebsite - www.artftlauderdale.comInstagram - www.instagram.com/artftlauderdaleFacebook - www.facebook.com/artftlauderdale",0.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Sotha's side job</h3>
<p>Art in Cambodia is one of the careers that don’t have appreciation or value. His work in arts, drawing didn’t generate enough income for his living. The same thing happened to his entire art fellow, and they all started to abundant art. He got married in 2017 and making a stable income becomes the main priority. He opened a small coffee shop on the street in 2018 and spend most of this time their to sell coffee. Since then he less and less time to draw and doing art.</p>

We are building art space for the community



The Impact
Sotha is an artist. He finished 9th grade from Public school and start to learn art with an NGO called Campey. He then started to make a living in art by drawing on wall for shops, coffee, hotel, pagoda and restaurant. At nighttime, he gathered his friends and rent a small spot to do portrait drawing for people in the night market.




Helping the community 
In the meantime, he helped others who need help. He stared in several film of Davy Chou, a French filmmaker. Below was one of the short films. He learns how to use camera and start to help people filming their film and videos.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6529186/

Golden Slumbers (2011)
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2087847/
 
Sotha's side job
Art in Cambodia is one of the careers that don’t have appreciation or value. His work in arts, drawing didn’t generate enough income for his living. The same thing happened to his entire art fellow, and they all started to abundant art. He got married in 2017 and making a stable income becomes the main priority. He opened a small coffee shop on the street in 2018 and spend most of this time their to sell coffee. Since then he less and less time to draw and doing art.


He dreams to have his own space to do art and generate a stable income. He would turn it into an art hub for his friends and started to make income for them by giving art class to kids in the community, sell coffee and sell his own artworks there.
August of 2019, he met me, a friend who want to make his dream happen and find a small land and looking for some money for him to continue. He design his dream art studio and willing to start to build it soon. He and his friend manage to raise fund about 5500$ but it is not enough to build the first floor.


We are looking for fund of 3000$ to be able to finish the first floor, move his coffee and start to do his art work there.

Your contribution will go to make his small dream come big. There are three thing that’s going to happen after funded:

Building a place where Sotha will be able to move from the street to there, his street coffee now will be moving there also.

<p><i><strong>*Safety and Content Warning* This installation deals with themes of sexual violence, and may not be suitable for all viewers, specifically children. All sharp objects will be out of viewers’ reach.</strong></i><br/> </p>
<h3>Why ""Touch""?</h3>
<p>My name is Eliza Leighton. I am a visual artist and performer based in Philadelphia, and I work primarily in installations. I am currently working on “Touch” and asking for donations to help pay for materials.</p>
<p>“Touch” is a response to a letter that the father of Brock Turner, a Stanford student convicted of sexual assault, wrote to the media. In this letter, Turner’s father lamented his son’s conviction as an unfair consequence of a twenty-minute mistake, which spawned an anonymous letter written by the victim detailing the long-term consequences of Turner’s actions. “Touch” is my own similar response. It is about my battle with accepting, comprehending, living with, and overcoming the violent acts committed against me that have entirely changed who I am and will affect me for the rest of my life. </p>
<p>In 2016, I created a version of this installation which occupied the third-floor balcony of the Community Education Center Theatre in West Philadelphia. Since then, I have been brainstorming ways to expand and refine it. I applied for grants and looked for a space to make it happen. I found the space, but the grants fell through. I decided to make the installation anyway, and hoped I would be able to save enough money to pay for the materials. However, some uncontrollable life factors got in my way: expensive vet bills, loss of food stamps, having more expenses than my monthly income could meet. Your donation will prevent me from going further into debt.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where the Money Goes</h3>
<p>The $1100 I am asking for will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay for materials and supplies need to construct the installation</li>
<li>Pay the carpenter I’m working with for his time</li>
<li>Cover $100 in Indiegogo fees</li>
</ul>
<p>If I do not receive the full $1100, the portion I do receive will pay for the supplies I have already gone into to debt to pay for.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Donating to “Touch” will help me to create this piece that encourages conversations about sexual violence and the #metoo movement, and furthers awareness of this issue.</strong></p>
<p>On a personal level, this is my first solo show! I’ve created other installations in the past, like “Nice White Lady”, “Little Debbie”, and “Plz Touch” (all featured in the video above). For each one, I managed to create large-scale and immersive works with very limited resources. Your contribution will help me to create the largest and most developed installation I’ve created yet!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I recognize that putting the supplies for my installation on my credit card is risky, and many may find it to be an irresponsible decision. Unfortunately, there are few resources, other than grants, that exist to help artists pay for supplies. I encourage you to look at it this way: I feel that this project is important enough to take this risk, and will continue to work to pay off my debt.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Hematology was inspired by a genetic blood disorder called Hereditary Elliptocytosis that I was diagnosed with as a baby. For years, I've spent time in and out of the hospital at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital having my blood count checked and finding ways to cope with having a blood disorder. After seeing my blood smears during a hospital visit in 2016, I decided to create a line of printed travel wear garments inspired by irregular blood cells.

<p>I have invested my entire life into becoming a fashion designer. After working in New York as a visual merchandiser and show room representative, I moved to London to pursue fashion design. A few years later, I attended American Intercontinental University (Now Regents University) and started working as a fashion illustrator. I've worked for brands such as NARS Cosmetics, The Peninsula Hotel Tokyo, High Line Park NYC, and Cameleon Visual Merchandising to name a few. I then continued my studies at London College of Fashion earning an honors degree in Fashion Design and Technology. Before attending London College of Fashion, I had the challenge of paying for tuition for school. Similar to now, I knew I had a very unique point of view and ideas that the world needed. So, I refused to let that stop me. I diligently looked for ways to fund the first year and with the help of family and friends, I was able to fund the first year of school through crowd funding.

Through the past few years of traveling and researching more about blood disorders, I found a need for versatile travel garments giving women the freedom to travel with ease and comfort. 

Deep oxbloods, purples, and maroons that represent the color of blood are present throughout the entire collection. As she travels, low crotch draped trousers, comfortable blazers are paired with printed mono jumpsuits and flowy blouses. Pockets and hidden panels are present on every single garment, including shirts. 
By donating to this campaign, you will help make this collection available to a wider market of women throughout the world. You will help change the trajectory of typical leisure travel wear garments into travel clothes that's luxurious, stylish yet completely comfortable.

If you wish to give to the making of the Hematology collection for the sake of giving, please do! However, I have a selection of amazing incentives for you to receive for your donation. Check out and select all of the perks you will receive for your donation in the column to the right.  The perks include fashion illustrated prints, fashion illustrated greeting cards, enrollment in my online painting classes, and the opportunity to host a painting workshop.

No contribution is too small. Contributing to this collection won't only help make traveling easier for women, but it will also help to bring more awareness to Genetic Blood Disorders, which affect mainly people from African and Mediterranean descent.
Who is Kris Keys?


I have invested my entire life into becoming a fashion designer. After working in New York as a visual merchandiser and show room representative, I moved to London to pursue fashion design. A few years later, I attended American Intercontinental University (Now Regents University) and started working as a fashion illustrator. I've worked for brands such as NARS Cosmetics, The Peninsula Hotel Tokyo, High Line Park NYC, and Cameleon Visual Merchandising to name a few. I then continued my studies at London College of Fashion earning an honors degree in Fashion Design and Technology. Before attending London College of Fashion, I had the challenge of paying for tuition for school. Similar to now, I knew I had a very unique point of view and ideas that the world needed. So, I refused to let that stop me. I diligently looked for ways to fund the first year and with the help of family and friends, I was able to fund the first year of school through crowd funding. You can view the full video here: https://youtu.be/Fc7LhCLoX2o . I was born and raised in Memphis, TN.

<h3><strong>What is Voices of Today?</strong></h3>
<p>Voices of Today is a is a five day festival with workshops, open mics, and showcases. It is the  newest addition to the set of festivals run by Spoken Word Canada, and its goal is to bring together youth poets from all across Canada to learn from community leaders and each other. This festival will take place July 24th-28th in what is colonially known as Toronto, ON.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528949927/l4n6qxrakpu16s1hvtwc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Why is it important to support youth poetry?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Youth are not only the voices of the future, but also the voices of the present, <u>the voices of today</u>. </strong>They are already doing amazing and innovative things, yet they are often underestimated. Youth poets deserve space to discuss, learn, share, and feel validated in their ability to be a part of this community. Various workshops throughout the festival about writing, performance, and much more will give youth tools to go change the world with their words.</p>
<p>Poetry is a medium that <strong>amplifies the voices of marginalized and underrepresented groups.</strong> Spoken poetry as a medium originated with otherwise silenced and ignored groups, and is a way to speak about topics that aren’t often spoken on, in a community of acceptance. Spoken word poetry is a more accessible art form than classical English lit poetry and some other forms of art as it does not require expensive equipment, or higher education. These youth have important stories to tell and their short poems are often both educational for the privileged and a form of therapy/validation for the poets.</p>
<p>Spoken Word Canada currently hosts the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word in October, which is an all-ages festival and thus open to youth poets and attendees. However, many younger members face difficulties attending this event due to school both secondary and postsecondary. Voices of Today prioritizes and supports youth voices who are unintentionally excluded from other all-ages festivals, sometimes by scheduling that does not account for school, sometimes by licensed events that do not allow attendees below the provincial drinking age (usually 18 or 19). Everyone competing at Voices of Today will be below the age of 22 and all members of the Festival Organizing Committee 25 and under; we are specifically positioned to understand the needs of our membership base.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Kauser. I grew up going to the Library bookmobile every summer with my sisters and cousins. On hot afternoons after lunch— four square ball in hand and red wagon with 1 or more of us kids—we’d walk to the book mobile and check out books. I loved the book mobile, a movable library with books, crafts and easy access to the playground. Now as an adult, with my own kids, after studying urban planning and living in Detroit and Cleveland, I passed by vacant lots in town and wondered about ways to transform them into places kids would be drawn to.  What if —instead of just a bookmobile, you could walk into story books? And, that’s how Literary Lots started. My desire to walk into a life size pop-up book in my neighborhood where there was nothing in space before.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560874728/w4jhltgnvlxvg1cka0td.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Here's how Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs Inspired us in 2013. Sandwich boats! Spagetti tubes! Tea Party with 6 foot flowers!</strong></i></p>
<p>We’re starting with a HUGE vacant lot (150 x 500 ft) in Cleveland’s Slavic Village, a neighborhood deeply hit by the foreclosure crisis.  We are inspired by the strength of its community, and want to invite and include others in its revival spirit.<br/> </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560874642/f4cjvf7q8vogpapsa5pe.jpg"" src=""""/><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Here is the lot we're transforming. Can you imagine the robots there?</strong></i></p>
<p>This lot will be transformed into a forest and tech town inspired by the book The Wild Robot by Peter Brown.Technology and artificial intelligence in the form of a robot force a group of island animals to reexamine identities, friendships, and their community. The Wild Robot makes us think about what it means to be alive, adaptable, forgiving and, most important, to be connected to one another. And, isn’t that what we need right now? Ways to connect with each other, and places to do this in. We believe “walking into a book” is inspiring. It changes the way people see and use space, and impacts their sense of community, belonging and creativity.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This year we want to do a Literary Lots on a bigger scale in a Cleveland neighborhood devastated by the foreclosure crisis (the impact is still here) but supported by a tight knit community of residents, youth, and activists.</p>
<p>Good news is we’ve raised $45,000 through grants but still need another $10,000 to fully support the kids programming with:  more robust maker programming (the robot part of our lot), a food truck (kids like to eat),and additional time for artists to work directly with youth.</p>
<p>What do you get if you contribute? One-of-a-kind awesomely designed T-Shirts, stickers or posters by Jordan Wong. I mean like - very cool – your computer or water bottle will have THE best stickers of robots and nature.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560875450/vpvloragaaa9rpx8mx33.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All the funds will go to the artists and teachers directly. We’ll use the grant money we’ve raised already to put up the infrastructure and pay for a portion of the programming. Your money goes to help fund a deeper level of engagement and time from the artists we are hiring.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It’s a strange thing to walk through a neighborhood street that’s a shadow of its former self. Knowing something was there and gone, and not sure what’s coming. In the vacant lots, we provide a temporary space to be creative and reimagine not only the space, but ways to read, write, make art and engage. Who doesn’t want to run into a huge space with a cave, life size bird nest, maker space, robots, the Wild Stage and an Airstream rehabbed to be our food truck?</p>
<p>For many youth in this struggling neighborhood,  museums and summer camps are not options. In Slavic Village —one of the poorer neighborhoods you’ll find in any city in the country— things are changing, slowly, creatively.  It’s alive with possibility. Over 20 nonprofit organizations are working to improve literacy and support youth with the wrap around services they deserve to be successful. Literary Lots fits right in. Literary Lots programming is free to all. Every day. All day. We did this before for 2 weeks, with over 1,200 people climbing into submarines we built inspired by 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, or the 8 ft. sandwich boats inspired by Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. You can help us build this place (that will be open 4 weeks) – magical, a little bit odd to see on an urban city street, and a whole lot awesome. Wouldn’t you want to say you helped bring robots and the wild to a city street in Cleveland?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The grant funds we worked hard to raise are the backbone of this project, but it’s not enough. Artists and teachers deserve to be paid to provide this programming. Youth in this neighborhood have the potential to hang out in a cool space they will help create and enhance over the summer.</p>
<p>We have a dedicated team of planners, designers and artists doing amazing things in all kinds of different ways (check out partners: Soulcraft, Lake Erie Ink, Broadway School of Music, artists from Rooms to Let, Cleveland Orchestra Outreach Team, and artists from Ingenuity.) We just need a little more support and we’d love to add you to our list of supporters.  </p>
<p>We’ll use all the money we earn from this campaign to add programming. All the money goes to support the organizations building this. If we don’t raise it all, we’ll do the best we can with what we have. Can’t stop the creative process!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Ok, we get it – you may LOVE this idea but can’t support it. You can still help us – likely you use social media way better than I do (hate to say but I’m being honest) so please help me spread the word.  Maybe something like this: “Hey (insert friend’s name here), you have got to support this project that brings books to life in vacant lots. And you will get some super cool robot swag.”  Share, share, share. Good karma will come your way. I’m sure of it. And we can all use some of that right now, right : ) Thanks for reading this far, and supporting however you can. Good vibes welcome. Money really welcome. Sincerest thanks. Really, we do appreciate your support of the creative community arts. Be well friends!</p>

It’s a strange thing to walk through a neighborhood street that’s a shadow of its former self. Knowing something was there and gone, and not sure what’s coming. In the vacant lots, we provide a temporary space to be creative and reimagine not only the space, but ways to read, write, make art and engage. Who doesn’t want to run into a huge space with a cave, life size bird nest, maker space, robots, the Wild Stage and an Airstream rehabbed to be our food truck?
For many youth in this struggling neighborhood,  museums and summer camps are not options. In Slavic Village —one of the poorer neighborhoods you’ll find in any city in the country— things are changing, slowly, creatively.  It’s alive with possibility. Over 20 nonprofit organizations are working to improve literacy and support youth with the wrap around services they deserve to be successful. Literary Lots fits right in. Literary Lots programming is free to all. Every day. All day. We did this before for 2 weeks, with over 1,200 people climbing into submarines we built inspired by 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, or the 8 ft. sandwich boats inspired by Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. You can help us build this place (that will be open 4 weeks) – magical, a little bit odd to see on an urban city street, and a whole lot awesome. Wouldn’t you want to say you helped bring robots and the wild to a city street in Cleveland?

Risks & Challenges
The grant funds we worked hard to raise are the backbone of this project, but it’s not enough. Artists and teachers deserve to be paid to provide this programming. Youth in this neighborhood have the potential to hang out in a cool space they will help create and enhance over the summer.
We have a dedicated team of planners, designers and artists doing amazing things in all kinds of different ways (check out partners: Soulcraft, Lake Erie Ink, Broadway School of Music, artists from Rooms to Let, Cleveland Orchestra Outreach Team, and artists from Ingenuity.) We just need a little more support and we’d love to add you to our list of supporters.  
We’ll use all the money we earn from this campaign to add programming. All the money goes to support the organizations building this. If we don’t raise it all, we’ll do the best we can with what we have. Can’t stop the creative process!

Other Ways You Can Help
Ok, we get it – you may LOVE this idea but can’t support it. You can still help us – likely you use social media way better than I do (hate to say but I’m being honest) so please help me spread the word.  Maybe something like this: “Hey (insert friend’s name here), you have got to support this project that brings books to life in vacant lots. And you will get some super cool robot swag.”  Share, share, share. Good karma will come your way. I’m sure of it. And we can all use some of that right now, right : ) Thanks for reading this far, and supporting however you can. Good vibes welcome. Money really welcome. Sincerest thanks. Really, we do appreciate your support of the creative community arts. Be well friends!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Started in 2018, the <a href=""https://www.ftacollective.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Freedom Through Art Collective</a> (FTA) is a space designed to humanize and connect incarcerated artists across the country. Through a newsletter we send in once every month or two months, the artists are able to see each other's art, exchange creative ideas and feedback on their own art. FTA is made up of 20+ artists who correspond and creatively connect with one another with the overall goals of humanizing people in prison and supporting themselves financially through their artwork.</p>
<p>Art can be a therapeutic and financial lifeline for incarcerated artists, yet many work in isolation without an artistic community. Our goal for this collective is to change that. We started by asking ourselves, what principles from free world art collectives can we translate in the punitive prison industrial complex? Our artists may not be able to have the freedom that free world artists do, but we are working to establish a unique creative community to support, encourage, and challenge creative capacities. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Pay incarcerated artists</h3>
<p>Incarcerated artists often provide labor without compensation, especially in the free world. As free-world facilitators of this collective, we build intentional relationships with ourselves and between the artists, and use our power as free world activists to maintain connections within a system designed to isolate. Incarcerated artists deserve compensation for their labor, both for their creative thought and their artistic product.</p>

<h2>The Metabolizer</h2>
<p>...is an open source rapidly deployable recycling center that is powered by trash. The Metabolizer consists of 6 inter-dependent systems that enable it to break down organic wastes and utilize them for energy, just like a mushroom does. The 6 primary systems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Structure</strong> - A lightweight and rapidly deployable canopy structure.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Shredder</strong>- An easy to build shredder box for shredding wastes.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Reactor</strong> - A machine that reduces organic waste into bio-char and energy</li>
<li>
<strong>The Generator</strong>- Any inverter generator, slightly modified to accept a gaseous fuel. </li>
<li>
<strong>The Battery Bank</strong> - A battery system for efficiently storing electrical energy.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Trash Printer</strong> - a 3D printer that prints objects from shredded plastic flakes. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Working together, these machines enable the system to power itself, using dry biomass as it's fuel source. A large component of what we call trash is burnable, organic material, such as paper, cardboard, grass clippings, leaves, and food scraps. The energy embodied in these common wastes is enormous, and when they are broken down in a special biochar reactor, they produce a clean, flammable gas that can power a generator with only minor modifications.</p>
<p>The generator powers the shredder, which shreds new material to feed to the reactor, which produces more gas to power the generator. The excess energy and heat produced in the process is used to heat water, cook food, play music, and power a special open source plastic recycling 3D printer that turns shredded waste plastics back into new and useful objects.</p>

It is an ongoing project until this technology is widely useable and available by anyone that wants to build one for themselves, their community, or needs one for, say, a pop-up and/or emergency situation.</span></p>
<p><strong>The goal of this particular campaign</strong> is to raise money and support to deploy the first fully working iteration towards that goal, at the <strong>Portland Winter Light Festival</strong> at OMSI, <strong>February 6-8</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the course of that weekend, a small crew of volunteers will attempt to operate the Metabolizer for as long as possible, in an attempt to set the first world record for continuous operation of a Metabolizer.</p>
<p>The funding from this campaign will provide that team with a working budget to add critically needed upgrades to the Metabolizer before, during, and after the Portland Winter Light Festival. We are asking for help to buy the last chunk of critical parts. </p>
<p><strong>Currently, the most critical needs are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deployable Coroplast Canopy for weather protection. $300-$400</li>
<li>IoT sensors for real-time feedback on systems. $300-$500</li>
<li>Addressable LED lights to run off of the trash powered generator. $200-500</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>And the stretch goals are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A Bigger, Better Generator - $800</li>
<li>A Better Battery Bank - $1200</li>
<li>A Waste Pelletizer - $600</li>

<h3>Is this real? Ongoing? How do I get more involved?</h3>
<p>All of the parts of the Metabolizer are based on existing open-source projects that utilize readily available parts and easy to find materials. They all work, and the challenge now is getting them to work together, as part of a larger system, and that requires a lot of trial and error. The goal of this campaign is to build the a initial platform for further research and development of open source infrastructure systems.

<p>As a backer of this project, you will be supporting the ongoing development of the metabolizer platform, and will help make the project more effective, efficient, and easy to replicate. You will also get to see the outcome of your support at the Portland Winter Lights festival and beyond!

<div> <h3>Who I Am and What I'm Doing<br/>
</h3>
<p>My name is Daniel. I am a self-taught artist in Las Vegas. Throughout
my life I have been painting. Until recently I've never considered exploring the
option of displaying or selling art.<br/>
<br/>
In July I was given the opportunity to display my art for the first time
publicly at a gallery in Las Vegas. The show ran for a month. The feedback was positive and I sold a few
pieces. I also created a website <b><a href=""http://www.uncalmart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>UncalmArt.com</span></a></b>.</p>
<p>I was then accepted into another show in September and displayed a few pieces. I want to continue this journey and travel to other shows outside Las Vegas.</p>

<p></p>
<b><h3>Why I Need Your Support<br/>
</h3></b>
<p>I
am seeking support for costs related to entering, traveling to, and displaying
at art shows. I have already invested in prints of some of my favorite recent
works, marketing material, a website, and more. <br/>
I have been accepted into an art show in Los Angeles that will take place in
late November.  Any funds raised here will be used for the travel costs
and costs associated with displaying at this show and hopefully
others in the near future

</p>
</div><div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The funds raised here will help me
to continue creating and find an audience. <br/></p>
<p>
If this campaign goes well I know there is an immediate future for my art. If
it doesn't go well... then I will regroup, change course, and determine another
path to try.</p>
<p>Whatever happens I will continue to
create art that I find visually appealing and work to find an audience for it.</p>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Your investment in me
is secure. Any perk listed is ready to go. I haven't listed anything that I am
not able to offer almost immediately.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Perhaps my art does not excite you. But
maybe you know someone that might enjoy it. Please share this project and/or my
website via Facebook, Twitter, email, Google+, LinkedIn, carrier pigeon, Pony
Express, Morse code, smoke signal, or good old fashioned conversation.<br/>

<br/><br/><i>ADDED 09/29/15</i><br/><h3><span>Why ""UNCALM""?</span></h3>
<p><span>The word <i>uncalm </i>is the name of a song by my favorite band, <strong>311</strong>.
 I have been a rabid fan since I first heard 
them over 18 years ago. Their message of unity, positivity,  celebration, and respect has 
influenced many aspects of my life. My love of art and 311 have been constant joys in my life for longer than any other interest. Many  hobbies and 
loves have come and gone but I'm not sure I've gone more than a day without listening to 311.</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>When I decided to start a website I wanted to find a name that represented 
my art. I didn't want to simply use my name. A 311 song or quote was an obvious choice and I think <em><strong>uncalm </strong></em>fits my style.<br/></span></p>
<b>""Stay positive and love your life""</b> <i>from Jupiter by 311.</i><br/>
</div></div>","Who I Am and What I'm Doing

My name is Daniel. I am a self-taught artist in Las Vegas. Throughout
my life I have been painting. Until recently I've never considered exploring the
option of displaying or selling art.

In July I was given the opportunity to display my art for the first time
publicly at a gallery in Las Vegas. The show ran for a month. The feedback was positive and I sold a few
pieces. I also created a website UncalmArt.com.
I was then accepted into another show in September and displayed a few pieces. I want to continue this journey and travel to other shows outside Las Vegas.





Why I Need Your Support

I
am seeking support for costs related to entering, traveling to, and displaying
at art shows. I have already invested in prints of some of my favorite recent
works, marketing material, a website, and more. 
I have been accepted into an art show in Los Angeles that will take place in
late November.  Any funds raised here will be used for the travel costs
and costs associated with displaying at this show and hopefully
others in the near future


 The Impact
The funds raised here will help me
to continue creating and find an audience. 

If this campaign goes well I know there is an immediate future for my art. If
it doesn't go well... then I will regroup, change course, and determine another
path to try.
Whatever happens I will continue to
create art that I find visually appealing and work to find an audience for it.
  
Risks & Challenges
Your investment in me
is secure. Any perk listed is ready to go. I haven't listed anything that I am
not able to offer almost immediately.

Other Ways You Can Help
Perhaps my art does not excite you. But
maybe you know someone that might enjoy it. Please share this project and/or my
website via Facebook, Twitter, email, Google+, LinkedIn, carrier pigeon, Pony
Express, Morse code, smoke signal, or good old fashioned conversation.

ADDED 09/29/15Why ""UNCALM""?
The word uncalm is the name of a song by my favorite band, 311.
 I have been a rabid fan since I first heard 
them over 18 years ago. Their message of unity, positivity,  celebration, and respect has 
influenced many aspects of my life. My love of art and 311 have been constant joys in my life for longer than any other interest. Many  hobbies and 
loves have come and gone but I'm not sure I've gone more than a day without listening to 311.
When I decided to start a website I wanted to find a name that represented 
my art. I didn't want to simply use my name. A 311 song or quote was an obvious choice and I think uncalm fits my style.

</p>
<p>The studio and artist-in-residency program at Little Bear Hill pulls together elements of a traditional printmaking studio and combines them with new technology useful to a large cross-section of artistic mediums.

<p>Dylan McManus brings over 15 years of experience in printmaking and installation art to Little Bear Hill, with his work in several collections and exhibitions around the world. For the last decade Dylan has taught graduate and undergraduate printmaking students as an Adjunct Faculty and Instructional Technician at the State University of New York at New Paltz, while also working privately as a master printmaker in both traditional and digital methods.</p>

<p><b>Our Request (What We Need &amp; What You Get)</b></p>
<b>
</b><p>We need your help to build our studio and acquire the rapid prototyping equipment that will move our print studio into the post-digital age.  This project has been in development through various stages over the last four years, and acquiring the land and location was the biggest initial hurdle.  Now that we have a gorgeous location to work from we are moving forward with our dream.  Our goal for the studio space is to create a modern, aesthetic, and creative environment that is both inspirational as well as sustainable in both function and design.  We will be up-cycling an existing structure on the farm into this space, and then creating a studio environment that offers artists a natural flow between traditional and new media printmaking processes.  Beyond the money required for the studio itself and relocating from the East to West Coast, the equipment we hope to acquire through our crowd funding include a medium format Laser engraver, two medium format 3-D printers one using FDM technology, the other utilizing SLA printing, and we also hope to acquire enough funding to purchase a 4x4’ CNC router.<br/></p>

<p></p>The good news about our Indiegogo fundraiser is if we come up short of our goal, we have enough space in the existing house on the farm to set up a functional studio that can house one resident at a time.  This is exciting because it means if we’re not initially able to realize our vision for the larger space, we will be able to use the funds we do raise to acquire equipment and thus offer the world access to Little Bear Hill as we continue work on the larger studio. This multi-directional approach toward building the space allows us to be flexible given the success of our initial fundraising, grant writing, and growing season. If we are not able to meet our fundraising goal we are still able to adapt our initial approach  toward the best possible outcome for Little Bear Hill. </div><div>
<p><span><b></b></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Vision Of Little Bear Hill (The Impact)</b></p>
<p>Little Bear Hill is our invitation for the global art community to collaborate in answering : “How will  Art evolve into the 21st Century?”  Our space will offer residents in various career stages the opportunity to work in a collaborative studio environment where shared innovation and dialogue becomes a spring board into new artistic revelations.  As we grow we will offer more diverse forms of residency opportunities. These programs range from a live-in, merit based emerging artist residency for one talented individual who wants to live on site while working towards their artistic goals, to multiple residency opportunities ranging in length from a single weekend to a month long focused study. </p>
<p>Little Bear Hill will be the first residency in the United States with the combined vision of offering traditional artists access to post-digital tools with a master printmaker available for hands on work, and emerging artists a mixed traditional and new media studio to provide them with the means to work in a professional print studio in an idyllic setting.  Dylan’s work as a global artist has seen him coordinate projects that span continents and connect multiple individuals with the end goal being a final exhibition.  He also comes at this project with a decade of teaching and technical experience.</p>

<br/>
<p><b>The Hurdles ""Challenges""</b></p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is moving to Oregon. However, we’ve done it before and we’ll do it again. After moving onto the farm and into our new house in The Dalles we have the challenge of building the studio. The property itself lies within the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and we will need to gain extra permits for building the studio. The commission governing the National Scenic Area is concerned primarily with environmental impact and land use, which is great for us as we plan on building a sustainable structure with a small environmental footprint.  The studio will combine up-cycled materials and a low-impact aesthetic that will merge seamlessly with the natural environment.  </p>

Little Bear Hill will be the first residency in the United States with the combined vision of offering traditional artists access to post-digital tools with a master printmaker available for hands on work, and emerging artists a mixed traditional and new media studio to provide them with the means to work in a professional print studio in an idyllic setting.  Dylan’s work as a global artist has seen him coordinate projects that span continents and connect multiple individuals with the end goal being a final exhibition.  He also comes at this project with a decade of teaching and technical experience.
              

The Hurdles ""Challenges""
Our biggest challenge is moving to Oregon. However, we’ve done it before and we’ll do it again. After moving onto the farm and into our new house in The Dalles we have the challenge of building the studio. The property itself lies within the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and we will need to gain extra permits for building the studio. The commission governing the National Scenic Area is concerned primarily with environmental impact and land use, which is great for us as we plan on building a sustainable structure with a small environmental footprint.  The studio will combine up-cycled materials and a low-impact aesthetic that will merge seamlessly with the natural environment.  


Final Thoughts...
It is with great excitement and anticipation that we launch this crowd funding campaign. We would like to thank you immensely for your time and consideration in funding our project. Please remember that every little bit helps, and that includes all of your support in sharing this project with others. Spread the word!!

<h2>About Me </h2>
<h4>(Here's where I write about myself in third person)</h4>
<p>Leslie Rinchen-Wongmo is an American textile artist working in an ancient Tibetan tradition. In her fabric thangkas, the sacred Buddhist images of Tibetan thangka paintings are rendered in vivid mosaics of silk. <b>One of the only westerners trained in the rare Buddhist art of silk appliqué thangka</b>, Leslie is passionate about the preservation and evolution of this cultural tradition. Her story is the subject of the acclaimed documentary film, <i>Creating Buddhas: the Making and Meaning of Fabric Thangkas</i>. And her thangkas have been exhibited in museums and dharma centers worldwide. Leslie's work is simultaneously traditional and contemporary. Over the course of two decades, her nomadic life has brought her full circle from California to India, through Italy, and back home to California. Each place has touched her and influenced her vision. She mentors students around the world through her <a href=""http://stitchingbuddhas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stitching Buddhas Virtual Apprentice Program</a>. And her Threads of Awakening Weekly Wake-ups bring a weekly dose of inspiration to many. Learn more and view Leslie's artwork at <a href=""http://threadsofawakening.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ThreadsofAwakening.com</a>. </p>From the Artist Spotlight invitation: <p></p>
<blockquote>When Leslie Freilich's name was changed by a Tibetan lama to Rinchen-Wongmo it was not done to deny her past but rather to catalyze a spirituality that she had been seeking. This Tibetan name means Precious Empowered Woman and reflects Leslie's embrace of life and the philosophy of Buddhism. She creates thangkas, vibrantly colored, meticulously sewn, sacred fabric scrolls that act as objects for meditation, for contemplation. Creating a thangka (sounds like Tonka) involves techniques that are centuries old and a keen understanding of and appreciation for spiritual tradition. Over the years Leslie's style has morphed from creating very traditional scrolls to a more modern, personal style that evokes both the ancient art form and modern quilting techniques. Whether ancient or modern, however, all of her art is infused with joy and serenity. </blockquote>

<h2>About the Artist Spotlight</h2>
<div>Each year, Focus on the Masters selects ten ""Master Artists"" for extensive documentation, a process that culminates with the Artist Spotlight interview series.  </div>
<div>
<b>FOTM Master Artists are selected based on criteria that include mastery of their craft, respect from their peers, and their historic role in the life of the community. </b> FOTM also gives consideration to selecting a group of artists who practice a variety of media so that all creative expressions are represented. </div>
<div>Each artist’s documentation begins with the gathering of biographical materials. Resources can include publications, essays, published work, slides, CDs, video recordings and ephemera of all types. These materials form the basis for each artist’s file. Additionally, Donna Granata personally interviews the artist in recorded oral histories and at the Artist Spotlight evening, which is video taped in front of a live audience. The Artist Spotlight Series provides the public with an opportunity to meet the artists and experience their work first-hand and allows the artist to exhibit original work, share personal experiences, and give advice to the gathered audience.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h2>The Project <br/>
</h2></div>
<h4>(What your contribution will pay for)</h4>
<p>Digital recordings from four cameras will be brought together into a seamless whole and interspersed with images of the art and story.</p>
<p>With your help, we'll <b>edit and publish the entire hour-plus conversation, making it available to the public and researchers, both online and offline.</b></p>
<p>We'll also <b>edit and publish selected “shorts”</b> online. These are segments in which Leslie responds to particular questions on topics such as trichotillomania, silkworms, and how to view images of enlightenment.</p>
<p><b>Production of these videos will help both Leslie and FOTM promote their good work in the world and will strengthen their ability to acquire funding for future projects.</b></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p>DETAILS:</p>
<p>Donna Granata and the whole FOTM team do a spectacular job gathering information and interviewing. </p>
<p>They add meticulous stage production, lighting, sound, and cinematography…</p>
<p>But these multi-camera, multi-track recordings are not really usable until they’re edited, and that requires funding. </p>
<p>Editing the full-length interview will cost about $1500. </p>
<p>I’ve budgeted another $400 to create short segments for quick viewing on single topics, for gathering supportive imagery and ‘B-roll’ video, and for getting everything published on the web. </p>
<p>Finally, because it costs money to raise money, I've budgeted $300 to cover the costs of running this campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span><span><span>Any contributions received in excess of the project goal will go </span></span><span><span>toward furthering the artistic and educational projects of </span></span><span><span>Leslie's Threads of Awakening </span></span><span><span> (75% ) and of Focus on the Masters (25%).</span></span></span></p>

We reached our goal in less than a week! I can't wait to share the video with all of you. Will keep you posted on the progress of editing. Our first team meeting is on May 13. In the meantime, this campaign will remain open till the end of May. 
Your additional contribution can help
complete the photographic part of my own documentation, 
edit other artists’ interviews, and 

preserve and teach the ancient techniques of Tibetan appliqué. 

Select a ""perk"" on the right to direct your contribution to the activity that inspires you most. You're not limited to the dollar amount shown in the perk description. After selecting your direction, you are welcome to add whatever additional contribution you like!
**************************Below is the original project description. As promised, any contributions received in excess of the project goal will go toward furthering the artistic and educational projects of Leslie's Threads of Awakening and of Focus on the Masters.**************************

First things first... 
 why have I called you here?
I had the most amazing experience last month being documented by Donna Granata of Focus on the Masters. On March 28, after extensive preparation, Donna interviewed me before a live studio audience. The loving energy was palpable, encouraging me to open my heart and share my story more clearly and powerfully than I have before. I want to make this interview available, in whole and in segments, to anyone who may be inspired by it.

The four-camera video recording needs to be professionally edited before it can be shared. I and Focus on the Masters are asking for your help in getting this done.

Why you might want to fund this project...

Fund it because you came to the Spotlight, were fascinated and want to listen again.
Fund it because you couldn’t make it and want to watch yourself.
Fund it because you want to share it with friends.
Fund it because Focus on the Masters is the only biographical archive of its kind in the country, illuminating the lives of artists and inspiring others to the diversity of creativity.
Fund it because you love Tibetan art.
Fund it because you love textiles.
Fund it because you love Leslie.
Fund it because you love Donna.
Fund it because you’re inspired when others open their hearts and share what’s meaningful to them.
Fund it because you think artists’ stories need to be told and that they merit preservation.
Fund it because the dakinis whispered ‘yes’ in your ear...

About Focus on the Masters


Focus on the Masters (FOTM) is a non-profit, 501(c)(3), art appreciation program that documents, preserves and presents the works and lives of accomplished contemporary artists. The FOTM archive includes photographic portraits, audio and video interviews, artwork and biographical research that encompass each artist's experiences, reflections and development. Not only is this rich resource made available to researchers, but FOTM also seeks to present it to a broad public through educational programs for all ages, notably the Learning to See Youth Outreach program, a monthly Artist Spotlight Series, exhibitions, publications, and an extensive resource library. FOTM is the only biographical resource project of its kind in the country. Its multiple projects are linked by a common mission: to demonstrate the importance of the arts to a healthy society by bringing highly accomplished artists to the forefront of the community. 






About Me 
(Here's where I write about myself in third person)
Leslie Rinchen-Wongmo is an American textile artist working in an ancient Tibetan tradition. In her fabric thangkas, the sacred Buddhist images of Tibetan thangka paintings are rendered in vivid mosaics of silk. One of the only westerners trained in the rare Buddhist art of silk appliqué thangka, Leslie is passionate about the preservation and evolution of this cultural tradition. Her story is the subject of the acclaimed documentary film, Creating Buddhas: the Making and Meaning of Fabric Thangkas. And her thangkas have been exhibited in museums and dharma centers worldwide. Leslie's work is simultaneously traditional and contemporary. Over the course of two decades, her nomadic life has brought her full circle from California to India, through Italy, and back home to California. Each place has touched her and influenced her vision. She mentors students around the world through her Stitching Buddhas Virtual Apprentice Program. And her Threads of Awakening Weekly Wake-ups bring a weekly dose of inspiration to many. Learn more and view Leslie's artwork at ThreadsofAwakening.com. From the Artist Spotlight invitation: 
When Leslie Freilich's name was changed by a Tibetan lama to Rinchen-Wongmo it was not done to deny her past but rather to catalyze a spirituality that she had been seeking. This Tibetan name means Precious Empowered Woman and reflects Leslie's embrace of life and the philosophy of Buddhism. She creates thangkas, vibrantly colored, meticulously sewn, sacred fabric scrolls that act as objects for meditation, for contemplation. Creating a thangka (sounds like Tonka) involves techniques that are centuries old and a keen understanding of and appreciation for spiritual tradition. Over the years Leslie's style has morphed from creating very traditional scrolls to a more modern, personal style that evokes both the ancient art form and modern quilting techniques. Whether ancient or modern, however, all of her art is infused with joy and serenity. 




About the Artist Spotlight
Each year, Focus on the Masters selects ten ""Master Artists"" for extensive documentation, a process that culminates with the Artist Spotlight interview series.  

FOTM Master Artists are selected based on criteria that include mastery of their craft, respect from their peers, and their historic role in the life of the community.  FOTM also gives consideration to selecting a group of artists who practice a variety of media so that all creative expressions are represented. 
Each artist’s documentation begins with the gathering of biographical materials. Resources can include publications, essays, published work, slides, CDs, video recordings and ephemera of all types. These materials form the basis for each artist’s file. Additionally, Donna Granata personally interviews the artist in recorded oral histories and at the Artist Spotlight evening, which is video taped in front of a live audience. The Artist Spotlight Series provides the public with an opportunity to meet the artists and experience their work first-hand and allows the artist to exhibit original work, share personal experiences, and give advice to the gathered audience.

The Project 

(What your contribution will pay for)
Digital recordings from four cameras will be brought together into a seamless whole and interspersed with images of the art and story.
With your help, we'll edit and publish the entire hour-plus conversation, making it available to the public and researchers, both online and offline.
We'll also edit and publish selected “shorts” online. These are segments in which Leslie responds to particular questions on topics such as trichotillomania, silkworms, and how to view images of enlightenment.
Production of these videos will help both Leslie and FOTM promote their good work in the world and will strengthen their ability to acquire funding for future projects.

DETAILS:
Donna Granata and the whole FOTM team do a spectacular job gathering information and interviewing. 
They add meticulous stage production, lighting, sound, and cinematography…
But these multi-camera, multi-track recordings are not really usable until they’re edited, and that requires funding. 
Editing the full-length interview will cost about $1500. 
I’ve budgeted another $400 to create short segments for quick viewing on single topics, for gathering supportive imagery and ‘B-roll’ video, and for getting everything published on the web. 
Finally, because it costs money to raise money, I've budgeted $300 to cover the costs of running this campaign.

Any contributions received in excess of the project goal will go toward furthering the artistic and educational projects of Leslie's Threads of Awakening  (75% ) and of Focus on the Masters (25%).

Comments from some people who attended Leslie's March 28 Artist Spotlight:
Your interview was the best I've seen.  -- Paula Spellman
I sit in the audience each month and wonder if I could sit in front of 100 people, baring my soul and heart. I am not sure I could, but I greatly admire your courage. Your art is superb and reflects your life. Thank you for sharing yourself and your art with us. It was a special evening in many ways.  -- Jo Ellen Lee

...so real, earnest, impassioned, caring, open to the world to share... and more... Thank you for sharing, Leslie. I loved being there in the room that you so richly and fully filled.  -- Kathleen Johnsen

Thank you again and again for your openness and sharing of your self and your loving beautiful work with all of us in the Focus on the Masters interview.  -- Jean Bramer
Being my first time, I was very impressed with FOTM and Donna Granata in Ventura. Great job to all! -- Liz Galvan
I've always been a supporter of Focus on the Masters and have attended many Artist Spotlights. But now, having participated in the process, I feel more deeply supportive than ever. Donna Granata does an extraordinary service with great humility, unwavering presence, and multifaceted meticulousness. AND we share a birthday! -- Leslie Rinchen-Wongmo
So nice to learn more about you and your art. Jayne in particular was really fascinated with all the talk about stitchery and fabric. Thanks for both your talent and your gracious and gentle spirit. -- Tim Pompey
Fantastic artist. I loved hearing about her journey and seeing her beautiful art pieces. -- Gerri McMillin
Another wonderful Focus on the Masters Artist Spotlight interview. Thank you to everyone who came out to listen to the life story of Leslie Rinchen-Wongmo. The love for this amazing art artist was palpable.        -- Donna Granata

<p>My names <b>Lianne Lowe</b>, I’m a recent
Fine Art Graduate with an insane passion to paint. </p>
<p>After uni I got a little job, moved
away from home and started my journey as a freelance artist. I quickly got
sucked into reality, a place where you need money to live and you live to make
money without actually living at all, where strange lifeless creatures crawl
around calling themselves adults whilst working a soul destroying job. I am now
one of these creatures. </p>
<p>Help me get back my life loving,
ambitious, child like sense of mentality, bring me back to an imaginary
reality, one where you can do what you love to do and get by doing it!</p>

<p>I want to create 52 paintings over
the space of a year (1 painting a week). </p>
<p>I’m mainly a figurative artist,
meaning I have quite possibly an<i> unhealthy obsession </i>with people, the human
form, the human mind and anything human related. (I’m not weird I’m just
enthusiastic). </p>
<p>I use whatever medium tickles my
fancy but mainly oils, acrylics and watercolour. I paint on anything because
everything is a canvas in my eyes, but for this project I will no doubt dive
into many skips to find wood, cardboard, wall or basically anything else I can
get my hands on. </p>
<p><b>So to sum up:</b></p>
<p>52 paintings in a year</p>
<p>1 a week</p>
<p>all relating to anything human</p>
<p>done in any medium that I fancy using</p>
<p>done on any material I fancy vandalizing
(legally of course)</p>
<p>So essentially at the end of the year
I will have a series of paintings I could exhibit in a gallery, but there are 2
main goals.</p>
<p>1.<span>  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To eventually gather up enough money to open my own studio, introduce
it to the public, collaborate and exhibit with other artists and also teach
adult learning classes.</span></p>
<p>And 2. To rebuild my faith in what I have no doubt in loving but
doubt I can make a living from.</p>
<p>I will start painting once i've reached enough money to get art supplies and once I know that people are actually interested in this enough to help a brother out.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get<span><br/></span><br/>
</h3>
<div>I basically want to paint for a living, and I know i'm probably asking a lot but as a years wage when bills have to be paid, materials have to be bought and food has to be eaten it all adds up!</div>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I'm asking for £5000 (ambitious I know) but this could potentially be the basis of a dream </span>business. </div>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">5000 ÷ 52 = (roughly) £96.15 a week<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">(the amount I'm hoping for divided by the number of weeks painting)<span><br/></span><span>= £384.60 a month (roughly)</span></span>

My names Lianne Lowe, I’m a recent
Fine Art Graduate with an insane passion to paint. 
After uni I got a little job, moved
away from home and started my journey as a freelance artist. I quickly got
sucked into reality, a place where you need money to live and you live to make
money without actually living at all, where strange lifeless creatures crawl
around calling themselves adults whilst working a soul destroying job. I am now
one of these creatures. 
Help me get back my life loving,
ambitious, child like sense of mentality, bring me back to an imaginary
reality, one where you can do what you love to do and get by doing it!
My Campaign



I want to create 52 paintings over
the space of a year (1 painting a week). 
I’m mainly a figurative artist,
meaning I have quite possibly an unhealthy obsession with people, the human
form, the human mind and anything human related. (I’m not weird I’m just
enthusiastic). 
I use whatever medium tickles my
fancy but mainly oils, acrylics and watercolour. I paint on anything because
everything is a canvas in my eyes, but for this project I will no doubt dive
into many skips to find wood, cardboard, wall or basically anything else I can
get my hands on. 
So to sum up:
52 paintings in a year
1 a week
all relating to anything human
done in any medium that I fancy using
done on any material I fancy vandalizing
(legally of course)
So essentially at the end of the year
I will have a series of paintings I could exhibit in a gallery, but there are 2
main goals.
1.  To eventually gather up enough money to open my own studio, introduce
it to the public, collaborate and exhibit with other artists and also teach
adult learning classes.
And 2. To rebuild my faith in what I have no doubt in loving but
doubt I can make a living from.
I will start painting once i've reached enough money to get art supplies and once I know that people are actually interested in this enough to help a brother out.
   What I Need & What You Get

I basically want to paint for a living, and I know i'm probably asking a lot but as a years wage when bills have to be paid, materials have to be bought and food has to be eaten it all adds up!

I'm asking for £5000 (ambitious I know) but this could potentially be the basis of a dream business. 

5000 ÷ 52 = (roughly) £96.15 a week(the amount I'm hoping for divided by the number of weeks painting)= £384.60 a month (roughly)


I have a part time job because as you may have noticed i'm maybe a little too ambitious, and rent has to be paid. (plus i've got an ADORABLE little mouth to feed)



(Her name is Caru)
I would love to quit my little job in a factory folding, tagging and bagging clothes to paint full time.

So you guys know I'm doing what i've set out to do and for you to know you're funding something worth funding, I've set up a blog to document every painting.The link is below.

Also here are some examples of my work!

Why your help is greatly appreciated and how it makes a difference!To be able to dedicate a year of my life to just painting, to live, breathe and sweat art, would be incredible. Please make me realize I can live doing what I love, because I love it more than anything.


I’ve always wanted to change the
world in some way, to make a mark. I don’t want to be famous, just respected
for what I do and remembered for doing it. There is ALWAYS a meaning in my
figurative art and I want to make people think.A lot of my work relates to bipolar, depression and other mental illnesses, I want people to be aware that these are real issues that real people struggle with in the real world.

    Challenges I know a week is a short time to paint anything of high quality and to keep that up for a year when life gets in the way is difficult, but I am a determined son of a gun! If life gets in my way I'll say, 'HEY! LIFE! MOVE OVER! I'M COMING THROUGH!' and i'll give it a look that could kill and shake my fist!

<h3>The Mustangs of Dead Horse Point, Utah</h3>
<p>My name is Tuck Contreras and I was born in San Diego, CA.  San Diego used to be a small town with a lot of open country and that is where I started my love affair  with the wild outdoors.  My first exposure to wild horses came while on a hike in the Virginia Hills of Nevada many years ago and I have never forgotten that experience.</p>
<p>My interest in art also started when I was young.  I have been fortunate, as an artist, to create many beautiful things using many types of media.  But it was with <span style="""">and oil paints that I found my muse.  I try to say something important with my art, to create a feeling of discomfort and wonder with my paintings.   The act of creating original art by one person can change the world view of so many.  That is my goal with the painting of this project  which I am going to call ""Mustangs of Dead Horse Point"". In this work, I want to bring to life the story of the event that took place so many years ago. The painting will memorialize an actual historical event which gave this point above the Grand Canyon its name. I want to show man's wonder, discomfort and even disregard of wild horses, which continues to this day. </span><span style=""""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""""><i>The story goes that horse rustlers used Dead Horse Point to hold groups of wild horses to be culled and sold.  At the narrowest point of the plateau, Dead Horse Point is only 30 yards across, creating a natural corral. The massive cliffs around the point drop 2,000 feet to the floor of the Grand Canyon, thus forming a natural barrier and affording no escape.   For some unknown reason, some of the horses were left corralled on the waterless point where they died of thirst in view of the Colorado River  leaving us only  bones to tell the story of ""the mustangs of dead horse point"".</i></span></p>

Wild Horses


Remembering the mustangs of Dead Horse Point
 
Towering cloud-drifts sail across blue sky
Ancients, 10,000 years before,
lived here and never brought harm,
beside fairyshrimp you survived on pothole water pools,
before history makers arrived, to drive you to these heights.
They rode north to rope and break your kin,
drove onto this isolated island mesa,
red rock buttes felt you suffer a dull aching pain.
 
Pent on this red island point
overlooking what is even now majestic,
the Canyonlands, thousands of feet below and away,
one by one your herd was broke and tamed,
led to water by gloved hands, past fences, to pastures and paths of Europeans,
to the craven 
untameable mustangs are easily forgotten,
even tangled manes and flashing eyes and split hooves,
they wear no man’s bridle,
unfairly made a left-behind band of broomtails –
in a sky adorned with red arches and great stone pillars
seized up high, Colorado River boundless waters tracing a silver snake far below – 
“you kept your freedom but you didn’t have much time.”
 
Today your corralled end prevades this place
an intensity whinies in the dry air
heavy clear skies push down
and pinon and juniper arch up on hindquarters and call out for water,
empty space hung beyond each cliff still presses in from the East, and West.
Exposed southern drop-off, demanded you retreat,
forced by your natural instincts in directions
that ended your living near a barrier made by man.
Your thirst for freedom is here today.
 
Those who listen recognize your ghost herd – you toss heads and drum on ground
where you once ached to be quenched,
you impart an emotional vertigo,
and your dark circumstances tempt me to throw my scarf skyward and ride
head-long into the chasm.
           
My memory of here is now forever bound to your loss, to Thelma and Louise, to
untamed spirits pent by wickedness and waste.
If we were to perished here, then or now,
we still remain as we ever were, so 
“let’s do some living after we die.”

<p>(in the studio throwing pots, and during my residency at the University of Delaware)</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I have been working seriously in clay since I was 14. I completed a BFA and MFA in Ceramic Sculpture. Working as an artist, technician and teacher, I realized that what I valued most was creating community and mentoring those who are coming up as artists. It is the thing that I love the most and the thing that gets me out of bed in the morning. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">BHCS is an idea that has been waiting in the wings for a long time while I searched for a suitable space. That search came to an end at the beginning of February when a couple of friends let me know that the space at 711 South 50th Street had just come available. It was perfect: my favorite part of my favorite neighborhood, close by to many thriving business, directly accessible to public transit, as well as having a large, open concept and lovely outdoor space.</span></p>
<p>No dream this ambitious can be realized by one person, which is why you find yourself on this page. I hope you'll read my story and consider contributing to help make Black Hound Clay Studio a reality.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">What The Studio Needs </span></h2>
</div><div>
<p>The start up costs for the studio are considerable. BHCS will have everything for a clay artist to make their work; that means pottery wheels, kilns, a slab roller and an extruder will need to be purchased. Also needed are things like plumbing for sinks and electrical and ventilation for the kilns.  There are a lot of miscellaneous costs as well, everything from copier paper to hiring an accountant. </p>
<p>We had a successful fundraising raffle held at Art Star Gallery and Boutique on March 12. This effort raised almost $1500 and really cemented my faith in the arts community to support a venture as big as this one.</p>
<p>BHCS was also lucky enough to secure a loan from Philadelphia Federal Credit Union (a great institution a stone's throw from the studio!) that will cover the deposit and first few months' rent for the space as well preliminary work done to the floors and walls (which is currently under way). The funds raised here on Indiegogo will go toward the equipment and outfitting of the studio. </p>
<p>That's where you come in!</p>
<p>The gods of free craigslist stuff have smiled upon me and I've collected many things already, including work tables, shelving and storage. I currently have four working pottery wheels, most of which were donated by friends and family or bought used. BHCS is well on its way.</p>
<p>The total amount we would like to raise is $10,000. To give an idea of the costs, here is a short list of some of the larger items we still need to purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skutt KM-1027 Kiln: $2200</li>
<li>Furniture Kit and Envirovent for kiln: $755</li>
<li>North Star 24"" Slab Roller: $815</li>
<li>North Star Extruder: $309.50</li>
<li>Stools for wheels and work tables: $285</li>
<li>plumbing hookup for sink: $500</li>
<li>Linoleum for floors: $1400</li>
</ul>
<p>A full, exhaustive list of everything needed is available, just ask!</p>
<p>In keeping with my philosophy of creative reuse, used and recycled items will be purchased whenever possible. </p>
<p>If the full amount of $10,000 isn't met, it'll simply be a matter of prioritizing what equipment is purchased. Essential things will be purchased first. It's the intention that, as the studio progresses, equipment will be added and the space will continue to be improved.</p>

</div>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Affordable studio space (indeed, any studio space at all) is increasingly at a premium in the city of Philadelphia. This is a problem in many cities as urban real estate prices continue to rise and artists are priced out of long held spaces. I watched this happen to my friends when I lived in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and when the studio building at 915 Spring Garden Street here in Philly closed this past summer.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I am hoping that BHCS will allow clay artists of any and every stripe to have an affordable place to make their work 24/7, whether they are a beginner just starting out, a serious hobbyist with a day job or a student newly graduated from one of the area's many art schools. When I graduated from Tyler School of Art in 2003, I was lucky enough to find such a space at a converted carriage house in Elkins Park, and it allowed me to continue the progress I had while in school. I would like to provide such a space to others and pay it forward.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">BHCS will be located in my neighborhood, West Philadelphia, right off Cedar Park at 50th Street and Baltimore Avenue. This area is home to many established and up and coming business, including Dock Street Brewery, Little Baby's Ice Cream, Greensgrow West, VIX Emporium, Firehouse Bicycles, Satellite Cafe, Cedar Park Cafe, Mariposa Food Co-op, Amari's, Snapdragon Flowers and Talking Headz Hair Salon. I am really excited to be a part of this growing business community and to continue to add value and increase artist involvement in the neighborhood.</span></p>

</div>
</div><div> <p>In many ways, I feel as though I have been preparing for a moment like this for many years. Opening Black Hound Clay Studio will truly be a dream come true for me.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">My practical experience includes 6 years of running clay studios. I began as an undergrad at Tyler School of Art mixing clay and glazes for the studio, and from there moved on coordinating work study students at the studio at UMass Dartmouth while I was a graduate student. For the last four years, I have been the ceramics technician at Main Line Art Center in Haverford, which includes running a studio used by 150+ students each semester, as well as developing and implementing programming for the studio. In addition to my technical experience, I have developed a successful pottery business called Stanley Chester &amp; Albert, which is currently in its third year. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">There are many risks inherent in a project this large, but my wide ranging experience as a studio technician will help me rise to the challenges of starting a business like BHCS. I think the single biggest factor in my success is this: I know tons of talented, hardworking, dedicated people who I am lucky enough to call my friends, supporters and colleagues. I am damn lucky to be a part of this community in the city of Philadelphia, and I am hoping BHCS will only strengthen that community.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>

<h3>And Finally:</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Please share this widely. It can really only become a reality if many people are invested in helping it succeed.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The space is currently under renovation and nearing completion. A lot of work is needed in the interior, including tearing up carpet, painting walls and laying a new floor, and most of May will be spent completing these tasks.

We had a successful fundraising raffle held at Art Star Gallery and Boutique on March 12. This effort raised almost $1500 and really cemented my faith in the arts community to support a venture as big as this one.
BHCS was also lucky enough to secure a loan from Philadelphia Federal Credit Union (a great institution a stone's throw from the studio!) that will cover the deposit and first few months' rent for the space as well preliminary work done to the floors and walls (which is currently under way). The funds raised here on Indiegogo will go toward the equipment and outfitting of the studio. 
That's where you come in!
The gods of free craigslist stuff have smiled upon me and I've collected many things already, including work tables, shelving and storage. I currently have four working pottery wheels, most of which were donated by friends and family or bought used. BHCS is well on its way.
The total amount we would like to raise is $10,000. To give an idea of the costs, here is a short list of some of the larger items we still need to purchase:

Skutt KM-1027 Kiln: $2200
Furniture Kit and Envirovent for kiln: $755
North Star 24"" Slab Roller: $815
North Star Extruder: $309.50
Stools for wheels and work tables: $285
plumbing hookup for sink: $500
Linoleum for floors: $1400

A full, exhaustive list of everything needed is available, just ask!
In keeping with my philosophy of creative reuse, used and recycled items will be purchased whenever possible. 
If the full amount of $10,000 isn't met, it'll simply be a matter of prioritizing what equipment is purchased. Essential things will be purchased first. It's the intention that, as the studio progresses, equipment will be added and the space will continue to be improved.


What You Get




  



We have some great perks to thank you for your generosity. In addition to launching Black Hound Clay Studio, I am a potter. My company is named Stanley Chester & Albert Ceramics. If you choose to contribute to the campaign, you could get a little piece of SC&A, everything from magnets to bowls to mugs to vases. 


There will also be a chance for you to have an inscription of your choice on dedication tiles that will hang in the studio.
There are also some fun experiences to be had, including a clay workshop with yours truly and 8 of your closest friends, and a chance to rent space on BHCS' enormous outdoor patio.



The Impact


Affordable studio space (indeed, any studio space at all) is increasingly at a premium in the city of Philadelphia. This is a problem in many cities as urban real estate prices continue to rise and artists are priced out of long held spaces. I watched this happen to my friends when I lived in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and when the studio building at 915 Spring Garden Street here in Philly closed this past summer.
I am hoping that BHCS will allow clay artists of any and every stripe to have an affordable place to make their work 24/7, whether they are a beginner just starting out, a serious hobbyist with a day job or a student newly graduated from one of the area's many art schools. When I graduated from Tyler School of Art in 2003, I was lucky enough to find such a space at a converted carriage house in Elkins Park, and it allowed me to continue the progress I had while in school. I would like to provide such a space to others and pay it forward.



BHCS will be located in my neighborhood, West Philadelphia, right off Cedar Park at 50th Street and Baltimore Avenue. This area is home to many established and up and coming business, including Dock Street Brewery, Little Baby's Ice Cream, Greensgrow West, VIX Emporium, Firehouse Bicycles, Satellite Cafe, Cedar Park Cafe, Mariposa Food Co-op, Amari's, Snapdragon Flowers and Talking Headz Hair Salon. I am really excited to be a part of this growing business community and to continue to add value and increase artist involvement in the neighborhood.

Risks & Challenges

 In many ways, I feel as though I have been preparing for a moment like this for many years. Opening Black Hound Clay Studio will truly be a dream come true for me.
My practical experience includes 6 years of running clay studios. I began as an undergrad at Tyler School of Art mixing clay and glazes for the studio, and from there moved on coordinating work study students at the studio at UMass Dartmouth while I was a graduate student. For the last four years, I have been the ceramics technician at Main Line Art Center in Haverford, which includes running a studio used by 150+ students each semester, as well as developing and implementing programming for the studio. In addition to my technical experience, I have developed a successful pottery business called Stanley Chester & Albert, which is currently in its third year. 
There are many risks inherent in a project this large, but my wide ranging experience as a studio technician will help me rise to the challenges of starting a business like BHCS. I think the single biggest factor in my success is this: I know tons of talented, hardworking, dedicated people who I am lucky enough to call my friends, supporters and colleagues. I am damn lucky to be a part of this community in the city of Philadelphia, and I am hoping BHCS will only strengthen that community.


And Finally:
Please share this widely. It can really only become a reality if many people are invested in helping it succeed.
The space is currently under renovation and nearing completion. A lot of work is needed in the interior, including tearing up carpet, painting walls and laying a new floor, and most of May will be spent completing these tasks. You can see the progress for yourself at http://blackhoundclay.com/blog. You can also find us on Facebook and Instagram. If you are local to Philadelphia and want to help (or just come by to see the space in progress!), please email me at bethany@blackhoundclay.com.

<p></p>
<p><span>Hello friends, family, and art lovers,</span></p>
<br/><p>If there are any artists in your life, you may understand that making art is not necessarily a choice for them.  Artists have a need to create. It occupies their imagination, their hearts, and their daily life constantly.  And they need 3 things in place in order to manifest creation:  time, space, and money.  </p>
<br/><p>I’ve been offered a residency in Auvillar, France this summer, and this Indiegogo campaign will help me take advantage of this wonderful and important opportunity. I have never been to France and I am excited to see how this new country, landscape, and culture will reveal itself in my paintings!</p>
<br/><p>Almost 4 years ago I moved to San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, where I work as a teacher and have a studio.  I know for certain that living in a different country, within a different culture, has changed my work.</p>
<br/><p>Recently, I have been working on a series of drawings inspired by the intersection between different biology and anatomy systems.  A gallery here in San Miguel is interested in giving me an exhibition in the fall and this residency will go a long way to making that happen.</p>
<br/><p>If you have ever admired, been transformed or have had your senses delighted by a piece of art, then you have benefitted from an artist’s creativity. I truly believe that art is what helps us to connect to each other and to the natural world.  </p>
<br/><p>I appreciate your support in helping me explore my artistic passion in Auvillar, France. I have already secured some of the money that I need for the trip, and I am asking for your help to cover expenses such as flight, ground transportation, residency fees, food and ultimately framing costs for drawings.</p>

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to combine the state of the art robot milling technology that I have been working with here with the experience of hand finishing a marble work. I will meet artists from around the world and be guided by world-class craftsmen. The Digital Stone Project is a unique experience that will allow me to realize a difficult work, network with artists and learn a variety of skills. 
As many of you know, I am an artist and MFA candidate at William Paterson University. Through the Digital Stone Project workshop, I will be able to expand my experience with digital sculpture techniques and stone carving. It's an invaluable opportunity to combine my interests!

My name is Heather Berthelette and I am a fine artist from southeastern Massachusetts. I believe that if you can dream of something, then you can achieve it. That's why I have never stopped creating and learning at any opportunity I could get, since my graduation from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in 2012. With a BFA degree under my belt, I have continued to thirst for more knowledge and understanding of our world and it's many cultures and ideas through my art.  <br/></p>
<p>During this past year, I stumbled upon the Greek language and began to teach myself, along with joining a small study group. I am now in two Greek classes a week and have been told I am doing pretty well for a non-Greek! I explore the ancient Greek and Roman art exhibitions all along the East Coast, gaining what lessons I can derive from them and drawing these ideas in my sketchbook. Even my local Greek community has invited me into their church, festivities, and holidays, in which I have gladly taken part of. All of this has been preparing me for what I know I am meant to do: travel to Greece and paint it's story. </p>
<p>In the midst of all of my studies, I was excited to learn of my acceptance to the Hellenic International Studies in the Arts (HISA) on the island of Paros, Greece. As a continuing education student, I will study for three months on the islands as well as the mainland, sketching and painting as I go. I can finally immerse myself in what I have been preparing for! Any and all contributions will go directly towards funding my education at HISA, a brand new series of work, and the opportunity to have my paintings shown abroad to fresh audiences. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>All of the funds raised are going directly towards my three-month semester abroad at the Hellenic International Studies in the Arts (HISA). This includes:</p>
<p>- Tuition</p>
<p>- Air fare</p>
<p>- Art supplies for courses</p>
<p>- Living essentials</p>
<p>I have already received two small scholarships from HISA for my studies. Because I am a continuing education student and already hold my bachelor's degree, they were able to drop the tuition by $1,500. For another subtraction of $500, I will be completing a work study on the island of Paros for a few hours a week outside the studio. All together, they have given me $2,000 off, but I still need your help to get there!</p>
<p>I believe in the balance of giving and receiving. With each donation I receive, I would like to give back with the gift of art! I will be sending signed prints and greeting cards, original mini paintings, and even some Greek-inspired creations to all who are able to financially support my dream! (Please view the ""perks"" section of my campaign page.)</p>
<p>If by chance I do not reach my entire goal, all of the funds raised will still be applied to a solo art trip. The length of the painting expedition will depend upon the total amount received. I am determined to create and show a series of work on my travels and, one way or another, I will achieve this dream, whether I am able to study at HISA or not!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The world has been filled with much disruption and negativity, which many people choose to focus on. There's also a lot of change going on in Greece right now. To me, I see this as a perfect opportunity to raise more awareness of all the beauty that is in this world, which is often overshadowed by outside events. This is a time of awakening and truly seeing, and supporting the arts can help us all do just that! </p>
<p>I have already personally experienced the impact art can have on viewers. In 2015, I journeyed to England and created a series of work based on my findings called, ""London to Glastonbury."" I had a very successful show when I returned back home. It drew attention from the viewers and local media towards the beauty of what I had captured in my pieces. That experience awakened a fire within me (a Greek fire) and I thought, ""What if I painted the beauty in this world, moments that some people may never otherwise see in their lifetime? What if I inspired some of those people to go to these places themselves in order to understand and embrace different cultures?"" </p>
<p>I know studying abroad and painting Greece will have an even bigger impact! With opportunities to exhibit both in Greece at HISA and back in America, this is a wonderful chance to support the arts and help spread the beauty that is still left in this world.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> Art provides strength, courage, hope, and passion to see and embrace the world differently. Behind each and every painting there is a journey and a story. If learning the Greek language and it's culture has taught me anything so far, it's this: they accept everyone, we are all one people, and we should support one another. Support the arts and support the journey!</span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I have had many obstacles in all of my attempts towards studying abroad in Greece. I have experienced a lack of support from close friends and family, challengers who try to sway me towards another path, and denied grant applications to study abroad for emerging artists. Most people would give up by now, but I have been through even more difficult challenges before and have made it through. The death of my 14-year-old brother always reminds me to keep reaching for my goal. In life, him and I were similar in that we believed we could overcome anything we set our mind to. Many of the things I do now, I do with him in my heart and mind! He would never give up and neither will I because I know that I am meant to do this!</p>
<p>Despite the obstacles, here I still stand, with the same passion and yearning to paint Greece. I will get there, one way or another, whether it be through a study abroad program or by planning my own solo trip. My vision is too clear for it not to come true and I cannot wait to share what I see with the world. Life is too short to sit idly by, so I embrace the obstacles as part of this journey to painting Greece!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I sincerely appreciate any help that I can get! If you are unable to make a donation but are interested in supporting this campaign, please consider sharing this page! It would mean the world to me. Spread the word and support the arts!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<i>The response we have already had to this and previous shows has been immense. It was so positive that many people and the theatre asked us to do it again, to continue the dialogue. </i>We want to stage more talk back sessions, take the show elsewhere in Austria and Germany and show our audiences important issues that can be expressed via entertainment. You can listen to some of our radio interviews see more of the play here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/viennatheatreproject"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.youtube.com/viennatheatreproject</a>
</li>
<li>All of our projects have seen a 90% to 100% audience turn out with super feedback from them and the press, The theatre is small but we have a wide outreach and want to continue talking about the things that make us get up mornings. Things we are passionate about and feel need to be out in the open and not hidden from. Our most humbling moment was when a muslim school came to see a previous show about Islamophobia and we had the most amazing discussions with these brilliant young people.</li>
<li>We are a small company that want to make a difference in a positive manner, we have no funds but pursue each project with a level of professionality and perservierance that enables us to get the job done. See some of the feedback we get from the press by visiting <a href=""http://www.viennatheatreproject.com/#!press/c14ak"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.viennatheatreproject.com/#!press/c14ak</a> or follow us anytime you like on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/viennatheatreproject"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/viennatheatreproject</a>
</li>
<li>We look forward to supporting and highlighting a good cause with the SAVE programme.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>The risks are we make no money at the box office and are unable to pay the actors. That is very serious.  </li>
<li>Not making the amount of money we need in time</li>
<li>Being able to secure enough interest in the production re-run in Vienna</li>
<li>Most astonishingly the newest risks....we were recently recommended to stop doing the plays as they are too dangerous in the current climate, even the press two years ago asked if we were not concerned. This is our response, if we stop the discussion we halt progress. Our shows  point no fingers, criticise no one, just open up a discourse on whatever subject matter  we deal with and make people think. We invite everyone to come and enjoy this wonderful experience with us and keep the discussion going.</li>
<li>What else are we doing? We are further applying to various companies and embassies in the hope they might be interested in supporting us. </li>

</div></div>","Cascadia Serapeum is a large scale art installation for Burning Man 2016. 
A Library, based on the Library of Alexandria, 38 feet in diameter and 16 feet high, with all the beauty of the Ancient Greeks, but with a contemporary twist that will challenge your preconceived judgements and expectations.

First, we would like to begin by THANKING ALL OF THE CONTRIBUTORS of our first campaign! With your help, we have been able to purchase building materials for shelving and structure, columns, and the central podium.


BUT NOW, WE NEED YOUR HELP SETTING IT ALL ON FIRE!!


Other events and efforts across all three cities have helped start off our build in a super exciting way! The central podium and book made their debut at SOAK*, Portland's Regional, and columns are ready to go for Critical, Seattle's Regional. Bookshelves are being built in Vancouver as we speak and this is 
ALL THANKS TO YOU!

                            

                                                                                                        
                          



                                                                        
     





With Cascadia Serpeum, we are hoping to challenge people's pre-learned ideas and perceptions. Things will not be as you expected, and there are many interesting surprises. On Thursday night of the Burn, the structure will go up in flames, leaving ruins behind. The podium and Community Book will remain in the centre, unscathed by the fire, reminding us that even in perceived destruction, beauty and community continue. Perceived ""destruction"" is challenged. Beauty and rebirth come from what may seem at one point to be an ending.

Fundraising efforts are continuing, and there is still lots to do. Things we are hoping to use this Part 2 campaign for include the lighting, propane for the flame effects, and DG for our burn in the desert (Thursday night at 11pm, btw) You all like FIRE, right???

<h3>The Installation</h3>
<p>I want to create a massive scale art installation with <b>fifty or more floating sea turtles.<br/>The floating Turtles will be white and minimal representing the ghosts of turtles killed by human impact, back to remind us that may still be there and it is our duty to respect the environment.</b></p>
<p><b>WHERE</b></p>
<p>The first host will be <b>Sardinia</b> after which I would love to take it to <b>any other island or location interested in this art project and in <span>the conservation of Sea Turtles.</span></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>WHY I'M DOING THIS INSTALLATION - Four re<span>asons:</span></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Worldwide<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> <b>millions of sea turtles have been killed in the last 20 years</b> due to: beach development, plastic refuse, poaching, long lines, nets, etc. Six of the seven sea turtle species are classified as endangered due to human actions and lifestyles.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.<b> I strongly believe that <span>art is the best and most effective way to communicate vit<span>al messages</span>. </span></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. <b>Sea turtles are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems.</b> They have vital roles in maintaining the health of the oceans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4. The <b>Sea Turtle</b> has an important symbolic role, it is the symbol of <b>wisdom, prudence, power, stability, regeneration of man and evolution. <span>It is the image of the universe and contributes to its stability. </span></b>In a broader sense this installation aims to remind us that, distracted by commitments and daily routines, we are slowly losing humanity’s most precious asset.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>This installation is part of <i>Sea Turtles from the Past</i>, an art project that involves the creation and staging of various installations and art experiences, in some cases installed independently, others in collaboration with other artists. In Sea Turtles from the Past <b>turtles who once lived in the Gulf of Cagliari, in our seas and oceans, killed due to human impact, return to remind us that they may still be there, and that we have to respect the environment if not turtles will disappear from Sardinia, the Mediterranean, from the planet.</b></p>

<h3>L'installazione</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Voglio creare una installazione artistica su larga scala con 50 o più tartarughe marine galleggianti. Queste saranno bianche e minimali, a simboleggiare<b> i fantasmi delle tartarughe marine uccise dall'impatto umano e tornate per ricordarci che potrebbero essere ancora li e che abbiamo il dovere di rispettare l'ambiente. </b></p>
<p>Prima location ad ospitarla sarà la Sardegna e successivamente vorrei mostrarla in altre isole ed altre location interessate a questo progetto artistico e alla tutela e conservazione delle tartarughe marine. </p>
<p>Perché sto creando questa installazione? Per 4 motivi:</p>
<p>1. Sono Sarda, e anni fa numerose tartarughe marine vivevano attorno alla Sardegna ma ora solo poche di esse sono rimaste e <b>in tutto il mondo negli ultimi 20 anni, milioni di tartarughe marine sono morte</b> a causa di: abusi edilizi vicino alle spiagge, rifiuti di plastica, bracconaggio, reti da pesca invasive, ecc. <b>Sei delle sette specie di tartarughe marine sono state classificate come in via di estinzione a causa delle azioni dell’uomo e del suo stile di vita.</b></p>
<p>2. <b>Sono fermamente convinta che l'arte sia il modo migliore e più efficace per comunicare messaggi vitali.</b></p>
<p>3. <b>Le tartarughe marine sono un anello fondamentale negli ecosistemi marini.</b></p>
<p>4. <b>la tartaruga ha un importante ruolo simbolico,</b> <b>è simbolo della saggezza, prudenza, forza, stabilità, rigenerazione dell'uomo ed evoluzione. È immagine dell'universo e contribuisce alla sua stabilità.</b></p>
<h3><b>Il Progetto</b></h3>

I'm a Creative Art Director, Designer and Artist, based in Sardinia, Italy, in love with life and nature and sea-addicted. You can see more about me here: 
Website - Facebook - Instagram
 
The Installation
I want to create a massive scale art installation with fifty or more floating sea turtles.The floating Turtles will be white and minimal representing the ghosts of turtles killed by human impact, back to remind us that may still be there and it is our duty to respect the environment.
WHERE
The first host will be Sardinia after which I would love to take it to any other island or location interested in this art project and in the conservation of Sea Turtles.
 
WHY I'M DOING THIS INSTALLATION - Four reasons:
 
1. Worldwide millions of sea turtles have been killed in the last 20 years due to: beach development, plastic refuse, poaching, long lines, nets, etc. Six of the seven sea turtle species are classified as endangered due to human actions and lifestyles.
 
2. I strongly believe that art is the best and most effective way to communicate vital messages. 
 
3. Sea turtles are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems. They have vital roles in maintaining the health of the oceans.
 
4. The Sea Turtle has an important symbolic role, it is the symbol of wisdom, prudence, power, stability, regeneration of man and evolution. It is the image of the universe and contributes to its stability. In a broader sense this installation aims to remind us that, distracted by commitments and daily routines, we are slowly losing humanity’s most precious asset.
 
The Project
This installation is part of Sea Turtles from the Past, an art project that involves the creation and staging of various installations and art experiences, in some cases installed independently, others in collaboration with other artists. In Sea Turtles from the Past turtles who once lived in the Gulf of Cagliari, in our seas and oceans, killed due to human impact, return to remind us that they may still be there, and that we have to respect the environment if not turtles will disappear from Sardinia, the Mediterranean, from the planet.

My home is in Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, but I currently reside at the Six Nations of the Grand River Territory (near Hamilton, Ontario). I am an Onkwehon:we (indigenous) man and I belong to the Kayenkehaka Nation, not the Canadian or English nation. My people have kept our ways and traditions, and despite generations of mistreatment at the hands of the Canadian government, we remain a separate, allied Nation with our own rights and responsibilities to creation. </p><p></p><p>I am asking you for your support in an important issue affecting me and my people. As you may be aware, the Conservative Federal Government of Stephen Harper has been mounting a concerted campaign to roll back and terminate our rights as indigenous peoples. In addition to the omnibus bills that sparked the Idle No More movement, the Harper government has also being targeting our people with malicious bills like the “anti-contraband Tobacco” Bill C-10 that target the lifeblood of our economy.</p><p></p><p>The Federal Government’s attempt to stop indigenous people from growing and manufacturing tobacco stem from their interests in keeping our communities poor and subservient. Our communities have been faced with an economic blockade, as government officials try and stop us from engaging in trade and commerce on our own terms and send our people to jail in ever increasing numbers for trading goods we have traded on these lands for thousands of years.</p><p>In all the time I've been involved in the tobacco trade, I have always only done business with other indigenous people on our own territories. We have been using this plant gifted us from the creator – one which our ancestors grew and traded with long before any white person came to these shores – to rebuild our economy and gain a measure of self-suffiency. This economic independence scares the Canadian government, because it means that our political independence will not be long in following it.  </p><p>On July 16th 2014, I was stopped by the police and charged for pulling a  trailer of tobacco I grew at my home at Six Nations of the Grand River Territory and had manufactured into cigarettes in my home community of Tyendinaga. I am now facing a $629,000 fine and up to two years in jail for the “offence” of growing and manufacturing tobacco on my own land, according to my own ways and customs.

I am a Kanyenkehaka (Mohawk)  man from the Tehanakarineh family of the Bear Clan. My home is in Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, but I currently reside at the Six Nations of the Grand River Territory (near Hamilton, Ontario). I am an Onkwehon:we (indigenous) man and I belong to the Kayenkehaka Nation, not the Canadian or English nation. My people have kept our ways and traditions, and despite generations of mistreatment at the hands of the Canadian government, we remain a separate, allied Nation with our own rights and responsibilities to creation. I am asking you for your support in an important issue affecting me and my people. As you may be aware, the Conservative Federal Government of Stephen Harper has been mounting a concerted campaign to roll back and terminate our rights as indigenous peoples. In addition to the omnibus bills that sparked the Idle No More movement, the Harper government has also being targeting our people with malicious bills like the “anti-contraband Tobacco” Bill C-10 that target the lifeblood of our economy.The Federal Government’s attempt to stop indigenous people from growing and manufacturing tobacco stem from their interests in keeping our communities poor and subservient. Our communities have been faced with an economic blockade, as government officials try and stop us from engaging in trade and commerce on our own terms and send our people to jail in ever increasing numbers for trading goods we have traded on these lands for thousands of years.In all the time I've been involved in the tobacco trade, I have always only done business with other indigenous people on our own territories. We have been using this plant gifted us from the creator – one which our ancestors grew and traded with long before any white person came to these shores – to rebuild our economy and gain a measure of self-suffiency. This economic independence scares the Canadian government, because it means that our political independence will not be long in following it.  On July 16th 2014, I was stopped by the police and charged for pulling a  trailer of tobacco I grew at my home at Six Nations of the Grand River Territory and had manufactured into cigarettes in my home community of Tyendinaga. I am now facing a $629,000 fine and up to two years in jail for the “offence” of growing and manufacturing tobacco on my own land, according to my own ways and customs. My actions harmed no-one and  were undertaken so that I could feed my family. With my pre-trial beginning on July 30th, 2015, I will be bringing a constitutional challenge to court, and requesting that the Crown handle this matter through the treaty relationship protocol that exists between our peoples as allies – the Silver Covenant Chain.
