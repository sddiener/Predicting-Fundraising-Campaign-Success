<p>-- Sarah Jean Anderson, six years (months?) from now, wearin' a Dishwalla t-shirt on her head, and feet adorned with CROCS...outside Degage' Ministries, telling people about how she used to be famous, &amp; panhandling...because NOBODY DONATED TO HER INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN back in May of 2013.</p>
<p>You guys...You hold in your hands, the future of my future. In other words, my future's future is in the hands of you guys's hands. Won't you give yourselves a hand, for giving me a hand? (""SHE'S ALWAYS ON!"" whisper YOU, to yourself!)</p>
<p>Hey guys, it's me, Sarah Jean Anderson! I'm a Grand Rapids, MI artist/performer, and I'm about to turn 29. The last year of my 20's! Somebody get me a xanax smoothie. And take me to Applebees for a ""fudgesplosion volcano chocolate death pie"" or whatever.</p>
<p>I've been self-employed for 5 years, and it's only been in recent (SINGLE) times that it has become increasingly more difficult to keep up with the amount of work I'm receiving, whether hosting, custom artwork orders, collaborations, out-of-state opportunities, or any other number of artistic/comedic performance situations. I have no manager, no agent, no business phone, no website. I have no rates, no contracts, no employees, no help. I have no car, no computer, and a phone from Family Dollar, out of service for three days now and counting. In my adult life, (18, when I moved out of my dad Bill Anderson's house) I have never made a major purchase, or racked up any substantial debt, meaning I have NO credit with which to rely on. Not bad credit, mind you, just plain NO credit. It's been hard to start my business officially, to commit to any long term plans or projects, as I feel like the money I need is just kinda sorta out of reach.<br/><img alt=""hey, you guys! "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/2199441582/sarahjeansmurf.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 3px;"" title=""business as usual""/></p>
<p><br/>SO...you look attractive today, by the way...can I have $5,000?</p>
<p>For nearly a decade, I've been entertaining audiences in person and on YouTube -- without ever owning a computer, a reliable phone or phone plan, or even a desk at which to sit and write. In 2011, in the midst of a divorce, I discovered that in the years before, I had been living JUST above the poverty line .Upon discovering just how poor I was, I looked over my calendar and realized that I had worked constantly and desperately, nonstop, without taking a break, almost exclusively at a super-low, bargain-basement-type rate. I've spent a long time consulting with my artist friends, and am learning how to price services, how to produce things faster, basically, how to be a businessbitch, something that never came very easy to me. I have to change stuff before I burn out completely and go back to my first love, pancake-related waitressing &amp; can-collectin'.</p>
<p>I hate asking for money, or telling people about how much money I make or don't make, and it's taken me 1,000 different plans, drafts and approaches to this fundraising campaign. Tonight it occured to me, I should just be honest as I can, cuz that's never failed me.</p>
<p>Awhile ago I read a book I had ""published"" in 1993, called The Star Of The Show. It was a really compelling and complex tale about a girl who ""wanted a chance to sing"", and at the end, she gets to go to an audition. SUPER interesting stuff. But the best part is, the About The Author. Looking at the answers I had given as a 9-year-old, I realized that 20 years later, I haven't changed. Under ""What I Want To Be When I Grow Up"", 9-year-old Sarah Jean said ""Artist"". I cried, but not from being sad, and not from being happy. Just, because it feels good to be reminded sometimes that you're doing what you're supposed to be doing, what you were meant to do. <img alt=""REE-TUH!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTovSZkevhVDROWKvy3sijOZCwbUBWi1CoSiDb4cJ4wcphAHuu_"" src="""" style=""margin: 3px; float: right;"" title=""Rita Schuvitinitscz""/></p>
<p><br/>When I was 18, I graduated from Forest Hills Northern with a C- in Advanced Placement Art, and 2 credits in Fine Arts at KCTC. While moving into a new apartment for the billionth time this year, I found my sketchbook from Fine Arts 101, and saw, AGAIN, proof I'm being true to past-Sarah Jean. On the page where I was told to illustrate my future after graduating, I saw cartoons and line drawings of me in long dresses singing on a microphone, standing at an easel painting, phrases like HAVE ART PUT UP IN A COFFEESHOP, BE IN A BAND, etc. And just like with The Star Of The Show, I've done, or still continue to do, the things I've always listed I would do, when forced to by authority figures.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><br/>I want to continue, but I need a little help. Like, I'm trying to hop the fence to the boys camp on the other side of the lake, with my slutty girlfriends. Can you take your muscular hands, cup my rump, and give me the little shove I need to tumble over the fence at last, and SCORE?</p>

<p>I love Grand Rapids, and refuse to believe that the only way I can ""make it"", is moving to Chicago, LA or Portland. Grand Rapids is where I began to live my dream as an artist, having been guided by the mentors I've been lucky enough to have in my life. I love my friends and family more than anything. Now that I'm taking time off to fund-raise, I am actually getting to hang out with them again! Imagine that!</p>
<p><br/>I'm grateful for everything you guys have done to help me, and please know that I will always be. Your love is so important, you guys! I'll never not show you how much I don't not appreciate it!</p>
<p>Think of this as a birthday present! What'd you get me last year? :) Yeah, that's what I thought.<img alt=""CLASSIC ADVENTURETIME COMIX!"" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 3px;"" title=""check it out you guys! ""/></p>
<p>Or think of it as a GIANT garage sale. Everything must go! That is to say, for the first time, I want something better for myself. Don't you guys want that for me, too? Hmmmmm? HMMMMM?</p>
<p><br/>My IndieGoGo campaign will go for 2 weeks, and will rely almost exclusively on FaceBook for promotion. The part that sucks, is that the very reason for this fundraiser, (to upgrade my crappy work conditions) is what prevents me from further promoting. It's just not possible. If I've gotten this far without this stuff, imagine what would happen if I could suddenly afford to fix all these little problems!</p>
<p><br/>Just like I tell my dad every time I get dumped and ask for a loan to move out of my boyfriends house (NOT THIS TIME!), I promise you guys... I'LL NEVER, EVER ASK YOU AGAIN. :)<img alt=""Hostin Lady Fest @ Pyramid Scheme in GR!

<p> </p>
<p>Please help me successfully publish another volume of Just Say Uncle strips. As a kid, I was captivated by the Peanuts anthologies I got when my Mom took me to the bookmobile on Saturday mornings. Who would have thought that someday I'd be publishing my own book of strips? </p>
<p>As an musician, artist &amp; writer, I earn my living in a variety of ways, including; CD sales, music reviews, video production, comic strips, and the generous support of patrons at <a href=""http://www.patreon.com/justsayuncle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.patreon.com/justsayuncle</a> . Projects like this book release literally keep the rent paid and the lights on. The price of the pre-order isn't going to some huge New York publishing house, most it's going to cover the cost of printing, shipping &amp; handling, and to pay me a few bucks for hundreds of hours of work.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Linda Zimmermann, and I'm the author of over 20 books, many of which are self-published because I am fiercely independent, and believe that writers, artists, and other creators deserve full credit and compensation for their work. Some of my most popular books are in the ""Ghost Investigator"" 10-volume series which chronicle my personal investigations of haunted sites throughout the northeast. A couple of years ago, writer Don Smith, who wrote for Heske Horror and Bluewater Comics, approached me about turning one of my cases into a comic book. One thing led to another and the inaugural issue of ""Ghost Investigator"" the comic book, was published in 2011 under our new independent Spirited Comics label.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sticking with the undead and pursuing my love of zombies, my latest book, ""HVZA: Hudson Valley Zombie Apocalypse"" follows the story of a medical student who fights to find a cure to the zombie infection, while fighting for her life in the streets. There are many minor characters and epsiodes that are briefly mentioned in the book that I wanted to explore in more depth, so Don and I decided to do that in an HVZA graphic novel. There will be several stories in the book, each of which will be written and illustrated by a different set of writers and artists. We are lucky to be joined by Nick Mockoviak as art director, and everyone is onboard and eager to see this project published. Our goal is to have it in print in time to introduce at NY Comic Con in October.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you know what it's like to need for someone to just give you a chance to show what you can do, or if you simply love zombies, we would appreciate your help with this project! And if you always dreamed of being a zombie, here's your chance to be drawn into one of the stories! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our main goal is to entertain people while highlighting the work of a lot of good artists and writers who deserve a chance to showcase their talents. What would make us the happiest? That the HVZA graphic novel is a huge hit, and all of the artists and writers get big, fat contracts to work on other projects, and then we have to hire a couple dozen new people to work on the second volume. Everybody with a dream deserves a break, and hopefully this project will open a lot of doors for them.  </p>

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Linda Zimmermann, and I'm the author of over 20 books, many of which are self-published because I am fiercely independent, and believe that writers, artists, and other creators deserve full credit and compensation for their work. Some of my most popular books are in the ""Ghost Investigator"" 10-volume series which chronicle my personal investigations of haunted sites throughout the northeast. A couple of years ago, writer Don Smith, who wrote for Heske Horror and Bluewater Comics, approached me about turning one of my cases into a comic book. One thing led to another and the inaugural issue of ""Ghost Investigator"" the comic book, was published in 2011 under our new independent Spirited Comics label.
 
Sticking with the undead and pursuing my love of zombies, my latest book, ""HVZA: Hudson Valley Zombie Apocalypse"" follows the story of a medical student who fights to find a cure to the zombie infection, while fighting for her life in the streets. There are many minor characters and epsiodes that are briefly mentioned in the book that I wanted to explore in more depth, so Don and I decided to do that in an HVZA graphic novel. There will be several stories in the book, each of which will be written and illustrated by a different set of writers and artists. We are lucky to be joined by Nick Mockoviak as art director, and everyone is onboard and eager to see this project published. Our goal is to have it in print in time to introduce at NY Comic Con in October.   
 
If you know what it's like to need for someone to just give you a chance to show what you can do, or if you simply love zombies, we would appreciate your help with this project! And if you always dreamed of being a zombie, here's your chance to be drawn into one of the stories! 


The Impact
Our main goal is to entertain people while highlighting the work of a lot of good artists and writers who deserve a chance to showcase their talents. What would make us the happiest? That the HVZA graphic novel is a huge hit, and all of the artists and writers get big, fat contracts to work on other projects, and then we have to hire a couple dozen new people to work on the second volume. Everybody with a dream deserves a break, and hopefully this project will open a lot of doors for them.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>It's seven months since the initial introduction of lockdown and my subsequent release from The National. At the time I could say that, since 2012, every weekend without fail I have produced a full-page, satirical comic strip based around Scottish and UK politics. Now, having pledged to continue self-publishing the cartoons without newspaper backing, I can still say the same.</strong></p>
<p>In April, I raised funds for what I thought might be a three-month 'quiet' period and produced '<a href=""https://gregmoodie.com/product/the-lockdown-chronicles/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Lockdown Chronicles</a>', a 20-page tabloid-size newspaper containing all the cartoons from that spring and summer period. It was a unique record of a unique time. But as we approach the end of this most hideous of years, it's clear that Covid-19 still has some way to go. </p>
<p>On the plus side, polls are now regularly showing a majority for Scottish independence and this, of course, has simply made me all the more determined to continue cartooning. So once again, I'm asking you to support the creation of the weekly strip.</p>
<p>In return, I will publish a festive stocking filler in the form of 'The Worst Of 2020', a 20-page tabloid collection of cartoons and other Moodie material that will take stock of the events and personalities of the year from hell, in a way that hopefully won't just make you want to weep.</p>
<h3>The Deal</h3>
<p>What I'm asking for is a basic wage for three months and enough to cover the newspaper's production, along with sturdy packaging and postage costs. In return, you will receive a physical copy of 'The Worst Of 2020' and have access to all of the cartoons online at <a href=""https://gregmoodie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gregmoodie.com</a>. All contributors, unless they choose anonymity, will be listed in the paper.</p>
<p>Additional perks include signed, hand-painted prints of a new Billy Connolly design, each one unique, and limited edition digital prints of the 'P45 Santa' image. These are ideal Christmas presents and will only be produced to order.</p>
<h3>For The Collector</h3>
<p>2020 has been a year that most of us would probably sooner forget, but it's important that we document it and still try to find humour as we go. 'The Worst Of 2020', by virtue of its sheer oddness, will be a very special and very collectible record of the year.</p>
<h3>Other Help</h3>
<p>Please share this campaign widely. Satire and art are both essential for the world's mental health, especially in these trying times. Thank you for your contribution.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Vincent Ferrante, creator/writer of Monarch Comics' <i><strong>Witch Hunter</strong></i> comic book. You don't have to nod politely. I can't see you, but I appreciate it. We're in the middle of crowd-funding campaigns for our small, fun line of titles which started with <i><strong>Evil Monkey Man</strong></i>, moved on to <i><strong>Witch Hunter</strong></i>, is at <i><strong>The Last</strong></i> now, and will culminate with the first issue campaigns on <i><strong>Horror Island.</strong></i> Let me tell you how we came to ask you for money for <i><strong>The Last</strong></i>, which won't be the last time we do this, because we have issue 2 campaigns planned. Now you know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monarch Comics exhibits every year from the front of the publishing section at the New York Comic Con. It's gotten us a lot of fans, attracted some great artists, forged some lasting business relationships, and, I'm most grateful to say, become the start of some amazing friendships. One such friendship is with the creator and writer of <i><strong>The Last</strong></i>, Joe Kitchell. Joe, a lifelong comic book fan raised on the classic comic book storytelling of the 70s and 80s, approached the Monarch Comics booth with some fiction pieces that he wanted to be considered for publication in our anthology magazine, <strong><i>Monarch Comics Chronicles</i></strong>, a little over two years ago. I published one of them, a dystopian-future science fiction story called ""Memorial."" We kept in touch. Joe would ask me occasionally if I had read any of the other stories he had submitted and asked that I consider publishing them in future issues of <i><strong>Chronicles</strong></i>. One day, I read a short story about Vikings he had written called <i><strong>The Last</strong></i>. As much as I loved it as a short story, it immediately struck me that it could be so much more. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I called Joe and asked him to consider turning <i><strong>The Last</strong></i> into an ongoing comic book series about this small group of Vikings known as The Fenris Wolves, about their adventures in a time when the Vikings were passing into shadow, when the mysterious unknowns of the ancient world were becoming all-too-many knowns, and the magical qualities inherent in ancient mysteries were becoming the mundane, quantifiable facts of an ever-modernizing world. It was a story about coming of age for the youngest Viking in the group, Taldar, making the most of one's prime for the middle Viking, Hogrun, and dealing with middle, and soon, old age, for the oldest Viking, Falgar. But it was even more than that. It was Vikings solving what could be called the first ""X-Files,"" a group of adventurers who knows that their kind is passing from the world and has a hunger to learn about the other whispered mysteries out there before they are all gone, too. This is what <strong><i>The Last</i></strong> has become, and we're so excited to introduce fans to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We've set up a lot of donation tiers with lots of fun stuff to say thank you for your support. We're very grateful to supporters of previous campaigns and hope you see more of what you love in <i><strong>The Last</strong></i>. If you do, please tell your friends, family, and people on the street to support <i><strong>The Last</strong></i>, and share the campaign on social media. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>     My name is Ahmed Alameen, and I am from Iraq. I am also the uncle of the kid who inspired me to create this comic and to help spread awareness about Autism through a unique story. I have published novels under the pen name A. H. Amin and became a national best seller with my fiction thriller, Psychs. As a comic artist I worked on motion comics before I finally decided to create something that represented a neurodiverse character in an Epic story.</p>

<p>My story features a superhero with autism. We decided to create a campaign that help us not to just tell an engaging story, but also to spread awareness and to help people understand more about Autism, which is our main motive to push this campaign. </p>
<p>     By funding this campaign you are creating a great contribution to the autistic community and to the people surrounding them. You will also going to revive the oldest story ever found in human history; The Epics of Gilgamesh, and make others become more interested in history and ancient stories that withstood the test of time.</p>

<p>     To help this project reach readers we need at first 6000 AUD (that is Australian dollars). The funds will be spent respectively as follow:</p>
<p>1- 2050$ for the artist who sketches and inks the comic. each page costs 50$ and there are 41 pages left.</p>
<p>2- 140$ will go for the editing to make sure the comic is error free.</p>
<p>3- 2500$ for printing 1000 copies for distributions and donations. </p>
<p>4- 640$ for online marketing (We will be seeking more funds in that regard)</p>
<p>5- 650 $ for the logistics.</p>
<p>6- 300$+174$+40$ for Indiegogo, transaction fee, and transfer fee, respectively. </p>
<p>This will be a total of 6509$, we might have to cover some expenses from our side, but it will worth it.</p>

<p>Of course if we weren't able to reach our original goal, we will either use what we have to create the comic and publish it online and on print-on-demand online stores. And if we couldn't have enough to create the comic, then the funds will go into supporting Autism.</p>

I want people to enjoy my stories and good stories in general. Everyone has a story to tell and I don’t think there should be any “gatekeeper” keeping anyone from telling their story. Therefore, the overall impact is to step around the gatekeeping and bring out new talent and new stories.Risks & ChallengesThe future's not written in stone, I can guarantee I will deal with any challenges I may face with this project. You must always be flexible and I have learned to be flexible in my life. This comic is going to print as soon as the art and lettering is completed.After the campaign ends, there will be NO REFUNDS issued. This is to ensure that items printed will not exceed demand, so to help properly ensure the best product available. Other Ways You Can HelpI understand that not everyone can contribute, but there are many ways that you can still help get the word out about the project. One way is to simply share or spread the word via Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mystery House Comics is a small-press publisher in Boise, Idaho.  Our mission is to bring the tools of self-publishing to potential comics creators and encourage writers and artists to take the first steps in making comics.  6x6 is a great opportunity to give feedback and advice on scripting and layout, to show creators step-by-step how to print and self-publish, and to practice salesmanship and table etiquette at conventions.  MHC also cares about expanding and fostering our local comics community.  The creative teams in each volume have never worked together before and learn to work with someone new while creating a new connection and making a new friend in the community they can count on for advice, recommendations, and future projects.  6x6 is a fun and adventurous project that utilizes the skill and experience of established, published creators, as well as providing a first opportunity for brand new writers and artists.  6x6:FORTUNE is guided by editors Mike Dreher (3-time 6x6 contributor and artist of CAT 5), Elysium Jacks (writer and 3-time 6x6 contributor), Jon Keithley (writer of Shivertown and Editor-in-Chief of Mystery House Comics), and Shanae Lavelle (artist of Shivertown and Art Director of Mystery House Comics).""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Mystery House Comics will print 200 copies of the comic book to be sold at conventions, events, and in retail locations like Captain Comics of Boise.  Creators are rewarded for their involvement with 10 complimentary issues.  Print costs total around $739 for those 320 copies (includes S&amp;H).  We will be throwing the creators a RELEASE PARTY in October to promote the book, and to thank and reward them for their time and effort.  The event will feature a multimedia reading of each comic with professional actors and a chance to chat with all 12 artists and writers, get their signature, and pick their brains about their work and the experience.  The only costs to the event are actors.  We will be holding the event at West Elm, a HOME furnishings store in Downtown Boise (get it... like our theme).  It means a lot to dedicate an evening to these talented comic book creators.  Please help us make them feel like the VIPs they are for an evening.</p>
<p>Rewards for contributing to the creation of this comic include: a signed copy of 6x6:HOME and original art, prints, and commissions by the creators involved!</p>
<p>In the event we don't reach our goal, what we raise will be put towards printing first and foremost.  This book is an important opportunity for creators of all experience levels to learn and grow, and we think it's one of the projects that really makes our flourishing Idaho comic book scene special.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>6x6 began in 2014 with our first volume, FERAL, co-published by Corvid Tear Media.  That edition featured work by Erica Crockett, author of Chemicals and The Blood Zodiac series, Albert Asker, Editor-in-Chief of Idaho Comics Group and publisher of Tarzan and the Comics of Idaho, Tarey Potter, whose art has appeared in every volume until this year, and included editorial work by Crockett and Joshua Shapel, co-founder of the Boise Library Comic Con.</p>
<p>The anthology was successful enough it returned in 2015 with MOMENTUM featuring Rob Liefeld-protege Jacob Bear, current 6x6 editors Mike Dreher and Elysium Jacks, and Bop Comics founder Randall Kirby.  Every year we're able to improve the process for the creators and to expand our reach and resources one aspect at a time.  In 2016 we were our most ambitious to date with the release of 6x6:PRETEND.  The book featured an incredible roster of writers and artists including Jacob Bear, Joseph Bradshaw, Mike Dreher, Dan Feldmeier, Elysium Jacks, Steve Willhite, and we pulled off the biggest release party yet with a live band and a slideshow timing each comic, panel-by-panel, to music and live performances by professional actors.  Last year's 6x6:FORTUNE featured Nathan Veibell (AKA Spooky Dinosaur), Arik Grant (creator of the webcomic Bohica Blues), and A Mighty Band of Microbes' Matthew Vorhies, as well as the debut of first-timers like Matthew Dominck, and Adozinda (returning in this year's volume).</p>
<p>Last year we debuted additions to the process we've always wanted.  In addition to a Meet and Greet for creators to get to know one another, we're hosting a Script Workshop and a Layout Workshop for writers and artists to sit down with their editors and work through the creative process face-to-face, overcoming obstacles and clarifying communication to ensure the finished product is more collaborative and detailed than ever before.  Oh, and enjoying donuts.  Many, many donuts.</p>
<p>6x6 is an important part of the Treasure Valley comic book creative culture.  It welcomes new artists and writers and introduces them to the creative partners who can help them make their dreams a reality.  It gives potential creators a chance to take their first drag in the art of making comics, and hopefully they come away addicted and eager for more.  When it's time for their next project they now know two handfuls of artists and writers to lean on for help, advice, and even partnership.  This project is a great chance to get experienced comic book creators who have their own lessons to impart in the room with people who may be able to benefit from their knowledge, and the old dogs can definitely learn a thing or two from new talent with a fresh perspective.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We realize you have a lot of options when it comes to crowdfunding campaigns.  And comic books.  And crowdfunding campaigns to support comic books.  If you can't help out right now... no worries.  But what you CAN DO is tell everyone you know about this campaign.  This is a passion project for everyone involved and it would mean the world to us if you would TELL YOUR FRIENDS!  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram... greeting cards...

<p>Hello, my name is Hillel and I
make comics. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a comic book artist but <span>I also had a curiosity about everything. My search for truth
never waned. I spent years learning but even in college, I still wanted
to create comics. I got a job, and then another
job, and then another job, and the whole time I still yearned
to make comics. </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446522012/fzhjflyheo25yykis2ku.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 168.316px;height: 260px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><br/>
I didn't actually consider being a comic book artist
until students in my How To Draw Comics class started telling me, “You ought to
make comics!”</span></p>
<p>With the added encouragement of
my wife I decided it was time pursue my dream…</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445871480/w78avfe9rzoljtxmncwz.png"" src="""" style=""width: 659.539px;height: 495px;""/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Now, I’ve started a company called New
Hero Comics (NHC); and <span>my comic is called <b>PROGRAM 13</b>. It’s about kids who are
given super powers and tasked with protecting the world from...technology! (duh
duh duuuuuhhhhhhhh!!!!)</span></p>
<p>So, I'm working on my comic,
drawing the pages and inking them and I realize that if I want to add letters
and format the comic I need to get penciled and inked comics from the real
world to the digital world. </p>
<p>Obviously, my work
requires a scanner, but I also need a copier and
printer—and it should be an all-in-one device! </p>
<p>Listen, I tried taking pictures with my HD camera, but the quality
just isn't the same. I need an A3 all-in-one.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h3>Funding and Perks</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Why the A3? </p>
<span>Comic book sheets are drawn on over-sized Bristol
board measuring at 11"" X 17"". Standard scanners scan 8.5"" X
11"", and A4 scanners scan at 8.5"" X 14"".<br/>
</span><br/><br/><p></p>

<div style=""text-align: right;""><br/></div>
<p></p>
<br/>
</div><p>What am I going to do with the money we raise? </p>
<p>You’ve probably guessed that the first priority is to purchase an A3 printer. <span>Here in Israel they cost between $250 - $300. They are
big machines! That means I'll need a sturdy table
to put it on, as well as a dolly to move the printer (remember,
it's big!). Of course, paper and ink will also have to
be purchased. Since they won’t deliver the A3
printer, I'll need to take a cab to pick it up.  </span></p><div><span style=""text-align: right;background-color: initial;""></span></div><div>

<p></p>

</div>
<p>Any money that is left over will go back into purchasing other supplies
such as more comic paper, ink, ink pens, blue pencil <span>lead;
basically lots of supplies. If there's enough left over I would like to get an
art table. I had one in the states but when my family and I moved to Israel I
left most of my supplies and equipment in the states, so I'm building my art
materials back up from scratch.</span></p>
<p>If it should happen that for whatever reason I don't reach my goal; I'll
use whatever money is raised to help me purchase the printer. </p>
<div>
<p><b>The Perks!</b></p>
<p>For those of you who’d like to support our campaign, we have some great perks such
as posters, preview pages, character sketchbook, and t-shirts. </p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>We’ve all seen Super hero comics, right?
Someone with a cape flies around and saves the day. That's not Program 13.
Okay, so maybe it's an anti-hero blood and gore fest about how if you gave
people super powers they would go around and just kill everyone (grrr). That's
not Program 13 either. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446493936/axbxoujuq7wp8mhdlj1k.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>Program 13</b>
is about kids who are given an opportunity to live their dreams and become super
heroes. Along the way, they <span>learn what it means
to be stronger than everyone else. But children
are innocent. Innocence mixed with power can lead to both very good and very
bad things. They have teachers—the same people
who created super powers. How will that help? </span></p>
<p><b>Program 13 </b>has time travel, super villains, action, adventure, and
weird characters galore. Your support helps bring all of this to life.</p>
<p>Your support will help
me get the equipment that I need to create this oysom (awesome) comic and also makes you a
co-creator of sorts. I'm really eager to bring <span>these
stories to life and get them into everyone's hands. These are characters I've
been developing in one form or another for
years. </span></p>

<p>This is like the pre-production
part of making a movie. <span>When Volume One is completed,
I'll be launching another campaign to help pay for printing costs, but you'll

</div><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Something could happen and for whatever reason the book
may not get produced, despite my best efforts—<span>that is a
Risk. The Challenge is to prevent that by
being nearly finished with the first sub-arc in Volume One, before launching
this campaign. I've already completed a lot of
work and that's why I'm able to offer perks. I've already got a lot of work put
into this; I'll be doing my best to see this thru. </span></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Not everyone can support our
project with money, but if you can <span>spread the word
about the project; use Indiegogo's share tools, and be a general spokesperson
for the campaign. Such efforts are tremendously helpful
and you’ll be a personal hero of mine. </span></p><div>

<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>In fact, whoever has the most
referrals <span>that result in monetary contributions
will receive everything in the $75 perk. To qualify, make sure the person making
the order mentions you by name. For example,
they should write, ""I was referred to this project by (first and last
name, and your email)"". That way I'll know that their contribution came from you. I think
this is a pretty great offer that means you have a chance of getting the $75
perk without spending $75! </span></p>
<p>Now go, spread the good word!</p>

Obviously, my work
requires a scanner, but I also need a copier and
printer—and it should be an all-in-one device! 
Listen, I tried taking pictures with my HD camera, but the quality
just isn't the same. I need an A3 all-in-one.



Funding and Perks


Why the A3? 
Comic book sheets are drawn on over-sized Bristol
board measuring at 11"" X 17"". Standard scanners scan 8.5"" X
11"", and A4 scanners scan at 8.5"" X 14"".






What am I going to do with the money we raise? 
You’ve probably guessed that the first priority is to purchase an A3 printer. Here in Israel they cost between $250 - $300. They are
big machines! That means I'll need a sturdy table
to put it on, as well as a dolly to move the printer (remember,
it's big!). Of course, paper and ink will also have to
be purchased. Since they won’t deliver the A3
printer, I'll need to take a cab to pick it up.  




Any money that is left over will go back into purchasing other supplies
such as more comic paper, ink, ink pens, blue pencil lead;
basically lots of supplies. If there's enough left over I would like to get an
art table. I had one in the states but when my family and I moved to Israel I
left most of my supplies and equipment in the states, so I'm building my art
materials back up from scratch.
If it should happen that for whatever reason I don't reach my goal; I'll
use whatever money is raised to help me purchase the printer. 

The Perks!
For those of you who’d like to support our campaign, we have some great perks such
as posters, preview pages, character sketchbook, and t-shirts. 
   The Impact 
We’ve all seen Super hero comics, right?
Someone with a cape flies around and saves the day. That's not Program 13.
Okay, so maybe it's an anti-hero blood and gore fest about how if you gave
people super powers they would go around and just kill everyone (grrr). That's
not Program 13 either. 





Program 13
is about kids who are given an opportunity to live their dreams and become super
heroes. Along the way, they learn what it means
to be stronger than everyone else. But children
are innocent. Innocence mixed with power can lead to both very good and very
bad things. They have teachers—the same people
who created super powers. How will that help? 
Program 13 has time travel, super villains, action, adventure, and
weird characters galore. Your support helps bring all of this to life.
Your support will help
me get the equipment that I need to create this oysom (awesome) comic and also makes you a
co-creator of sorts. I'm really eager to bring these
stories to life and get them into everyone's hands. These are characters I've
been developing in one form or another for
years. 





This is like the pre-production
part of making a movie. When Volume One is completed,
I'll be launching another campaign to help pay for printing costs, but you'll
have been part of the pre-production. Without the required equipment, it would
be impossible to move forward with the project. 




   
Risks & Challenges
Something could happen and for whatever reason the book
may not get produced, despite my best efforts—that is a
Risk. The Challenge is to prevent that by
being nearly finished with the first sub-arc in Volume One, before launching
this campaign. I've already completed a lot of
work and that's why I'm able to offer perks. I've already got a lot of work put
into this; I'll be doing my best to see this thru. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone can support our
project with money, but if you can spread the word
about the project; use Indiegogo's share tools, and be a general spokesperson
for the campaign. Such efforts are tremendously helpful
and you’ll be a personal hero of mine. 




In fact, whoever has the most
referrals that result in monetary contributions
will receive everything in the $75 perk. To qualify, make sure the person making
the order mentions you by name. For example,
they should write, ""I was referred to this project by (first and last
name, and your email)"". That way I'll know that their contribution came from you. I think
this is a pretty great offer that means you have a chance of getting the $75
perk without spending $75! 
Now go, spread the good word!",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>How this project is born and why crowdfunding</h3>
<p></p>The idea for this project came after having a hard time for different reasons specifically related to self-esteem and need for economic independence, and because of that I thought about quitting my passion, and so stop drawing. From this period came this story.<br/>Despite I was still doubtful and reluctant, I received from Linda Cavallini and Emanuele Tenderini of Tatai Lab the offer to create something for them. <br/>Being supported and helped by serious people who has already had experiece with crowdfunding with successful other projects such as Lumina, has given me the motivation that I need to throw myself into this adventure, and I can not thank them enough for this.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464949822/Canvas_The_silent_book_Alessandro_bkounq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>Who is Ilaria?</h3>
<p>I was born in Florence and passion for drawing was already in my blood: when I was a child I used to spend many hours watching my grandfather painting, so by having his example in front of my eyes, I found myself spending all day drawing ""Ibbi"" (""children"", in my five years baby language), before passing to my ""kittens"" period.</p>
<p>In Middle School years, despite my Italian teacher desperately wanted me to attend humanities-based High School, my idea was very clear about it: after my graduation exams I joined the Art School in Lucca.</p>
<p>During those years I got familiar with manga and Japanese drawing style, and my wish for the future changed from ""When I grow up I wanna draw!"" to ""When I grow up I will be a comic artist!""</p>
<p>For this reason, once graduated I enrolled for the International School of Comics in Florence; there, alongside with my classmates we got into the magical world of self-produced fanzines, publishing ""GATTAI!"", our collection of pure manga-style comics. The fanzine helped me to find my first real job into the comics field: I became a teacher at the European Academy of manga, At the same time I was working as a demonstrator for Pentel and Copic Italy, as graphic designer for mobile games and as illustrator for a documentary film produced by Sky television, dedicated to the tragedy of Fukushima and the nuclear energy issue.</p>

</div><div>Ciao
a tutti, mi chiamo <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ilaria.gelli.3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ilaria</a></b> e Canvas è il mio progetto, il mio sogno nel
cassetto.<br/><p>
<b>Canvas è un artbook con una storia,
ovvero un silent book, <b>un
racconto totalmente grafico e illustrato che tramite le immagini vi porterà alla
scoperta delle vere passioni</b>.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464169510/Canvas-Ilaria-Gelli_preview_Indiegogo_pvdfib.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Voglio
subito domandarvi una cosa: fino a che punto le passioni possono influenzare le
nostre vite? Trasformarle, modellarle e renderle piene? Cosa accade quando un
hobby non rimane più solamente tale ma diventa qualcosa di più, una passione
che si ingrandisce a dismisura fino a diventare essa stessa vivente?!<br/>
Questo è Canvas.<br/>
Una storia narrata per immagini alla scoperta di come le passioni influenzino
la vita delle persone, sia in negativo, che in positivo.<p></p>
<p><b>La storia è
quella di Alessandro, un bambino come tanti, con un profondo amore per il disegno</b>. Il
suo sentimento così forte, crescendo sempre più, si materializzerà. La sua
passione per il disegno prenderà corpo e vita a tutti gli effetti diventando
una bambina! Sarà proprio lei a fargli affrontare mille avventure e a farlo
confrontare con le emozioni più diverse.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461080922/Alessandro_Canvas_Indiegogo_whbgcn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b></b><p>Il volume che voglio realizzare è di 72 pagine con
copertina rigida cartonata, interamente a colori.<br/></p>
<p></p>
Il mio stile di disegno (come è chiaramente evidente :D) ha dei forti tratti
nipponici e i colori delle illustrazioni hanno l’importante compito di
esprimere i sentimenti del protagonista durante tutto il corso della storia. <p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Un regalo speciale per tutti<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>Per
dare maggiore completezza a questo mio sogno ho ideato e sviluppato
un'<b><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pimentoso.android.canvastutor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">applicazione: CANVAS TUTOR</a></b> - che trovate già online!<br/>Fin da subito ho deciso di renderla disponibile
gratuitamente a tutti per poter coltivare al meglio la propria passione.<br/>
<b>Canvas Tutor infatti è un’app per android utile a chiunque si diletti nel
disegno proponendo esercizi giornalieri per migliorare le proprie abilità in
varie discipline come l’anatomia, la prospettiva, l’inchiostrazione, la
colorazione e il character design.</b> Potete condividere i vostri lavori e

<b>Perché un artbook è associato a un'app?</b><br/><p></p>
Molto semplice, faccio parte di un team indie di sviluppo app, Pimentoso, che
fino ad adesso si è occupato per la gran parte, di giochi android. Inoltre,
lavorando per molto tempo come insegnante presso l’Accademia Europea di Manga
ho pensato di unire queste due attività, ovvero quella dell’insegnamento e
quella dello sviluppo di applicazioni mobile, il tutto incentivando e
condividendo il più possibile la mia passione per il disegno. Spero proprio che
possa aiutare tutti gli appassionati di disegno alle prime armi. Mi raccomando

<h3>Come nasce il progetto e il perché del crowdfunding</h3> <p></p>
</div>L'idea
per realizzare questo progetto è arrivata dopo aver passato un periodo molto
difficile per me nel quale, per diversi problemi legati soprattutto ad
autostima e necessità di un'indipendenza economica, avevo pensato di
abbandonare la mia passione, e di smettere quindi di disegnare. Proprio da qui
è nata l'idea di questa storia.<br/>Seppur ancora dubbiosa e titubante, mi è
arrivata in seguito la proposta da Linda Cavallini ed Emanuele Tenderini, di
TataiLab, di realizzare qualcosa per loro. Sapere di essere appoggiata ed
aiutata da persone serie che avevano già sperimentato il crowdfunding con altri
progetti come <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lumina--2/x/7469568#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lumina</a> mi ha dato la convinzione che mi serviva a buttarmi a
capofitto in questa avventura, e non finirò mai di ringraziarli.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461162225/Canvas_Illustration_gbzzb3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462867409/illu10_600x315_wl28hp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><p><br/></p>
<h3>Chi è Ilaria?</h3>Sono
nata a Firenze con la passione per il disegno nel sangue: fin da piccola
rimanevo ore e ore a osservare mio nonno dipingere. Così, con il suo esempio
negli occhi, mi son ritrovata a passare intere giornate a disegnare “ibbi”

Hello everyone, my name is Ilaria and Canvas is my project, my secret wish.Canvas is an artbook with a story, a ""silent book"" as I usually call it, a graphic novel full of illustrations that through them it will take you to discover what true passions really are.


First of all I want to ask you something: how passion can influence our life? Changing, shaping and filling them up? What happens when a certain hobby is a hobby no more but it becomes something different, a passion so big to become alive itself?!This is Canvas.A story told by pictures to discover how passions can affect people's life, both in a negative or positive way.


This is the story of Alessandro, a child like any other, with a deep love for drawing. His strong emotion, growing more and more, becomes real. His passion for drawing at last comes alive as a little girl! She will make him face many adventures and deal with many different kinds of feelings.



The graphic novel I want to create will be about 72-pages, full-colored book with an hardcover. My drawing style features a strong Japanese influence (which is evident :D) and the colors of the illustrations play an important role with the expression of the main character's feelings troughout the entire story.



A special GIFT for everybody
In order to fullfill my dream I also designed and developed an application: CANVAS TUTOR - that you can already find online!I decided to make it available for free so that everybody can increase their skills and follow their passion.Canvas Tutor is an Android app useful to anyone who delights in drawing, it offers daily exercises to improve their skills in various disciplines such as anatomy, perspective, inking, coloring and character design. You can share your work through the gallery and check your progress with drawing.
In addition, for those who have supported this campaign helping me to achieve the goal, I will provide a code that you can enter in the app to get extra exclusive content!



Why an artbook is associated with an app?It is easy to explain, I am a member of a team that develops indie apps, Pimentoso, which moslty works on Android games. In addition to this I work as a teacher at the European Academy of Manga, so I thought it would be great to combine these two activities: developing mobile applications and teaching, all by encouraging and sharing as much as possible my passion for drawing . I hope that it will help all drawing lovers novice. I highly recommend you let me know, and I look forward to your feedback!





What you can buy(List update, stay tuned!)The artbook, the silent book: ""Canvas - follow your passion""The color postcard + PSD File of one illustration with all the levels to discover all the realization stepsThe limited edition t-shirt created in collaboration with Kingyo Sukui!The sketchbook with custom cover!
An original colored illustration!

Perk composition

I have created a diversified offer as much as possible to meet all potential needs and curiosity: here you can find perks that includes from the artbook to postcards, from personalized sketches to private lessons.Have a good choice! :D
(The Perk Shipment will be done in Decembre 2016) 


How funds will be used
The goal to make Canvas happen is set to € 6.500,00 and this amount will be used as follows:


How this project is born and why crowdfunding
The idea for this project came after having a hard time for different reasons specifically related to self-esteem and need for economic independence, and because of that I thought about quitting my passion, and so stop drawing. From this period came this story.Despite I was still doubtful and reluctant, I received from Linda Cavallini and Emanuele Tenderini of Tatai Lab the offer to create something for them. Being supported and helped by serious people who has already had experiece with crowdfunding with successful other projects such as Lumina, has given me the motivation that I need to throw myself into this adventure, and I can not thank them enough for this.
Who is Ilaria?
I was born in Florence and passion for drawing was already in my blood: when I was a child I used to spend many hours watching my grandfather painting, so by having his example in front of my eyes, I found myself spending all day drawing ""Ibbi"" (""children"", in my five years baby language), before passing to my ""kittens"" period.
In Middle School years, despite my Italian teacher desperately wanted me to attend humanities-based High School, my idea was very clear about it: after my graduation exams I joined the Art School in Lucca.
During those years I got familiar with manga and Japanese drawing style, and my wish for the future changed from ""When I grow up I wanna draw!"" to ""When I grow up I will be a comic artist!""
For this reason, once graduated I enrolled for the International School of Comics in Florence; there, alongside with my classmates we got into the magical world of self-produced fanzines, publishing ""GATTAI!"", our collection of pure manga-style comics. The fanzine helped me to find my first real job into the comics field: I became a teacher at the European Academy of manga, At the same time I was working as a demonstrator for Pentel and Copic Italy, as graphic designer for mobile games and as illustrator for a documentary film produced by Sky television, dedicated to the tragedy of Fukushima and the nuclear energy issue.

ITA - DESCRIZIONE IN ITALIANO
Ciao
a tutti, mi chiamo Ilaria e Canvas è il mio progetto, il mio sogno nel
cassetto.
Canvas è un artbook con una storia,
ovvero un silent book, un
racconto totalmente grafico e illustrato che tramite le immagini vi porterà alla
scoperta delle vere passioni.


Voglio
subito domandarvi una cosa: fino a che punto le passioni possono influenzare le
nostre vite? Trasformarle, modellarle e renderle piene? Cosa accade quando un
hobby non rimane più solamente tale ma diventa qualcosa di più, una passione
che si ingrandisce a dismisura fino a diventare essa stessa vivente?!
Questo è Canvas.
Una storia narrata per immagini alla scoperta di come le passioni influenzino
la vita delle persone, sia in negativo, che in positivo.
La storia è
quella di Alessandro, un bambino come tanti, con un profondo amore per il disegno. Il
suo sentimento così forte, crescendo sempre più, si materializzerà. La sua
passione per il disegno prenderà corpo e vita a tutti gli effetti diventando
una bambina! Sarà proprio lei a fargli affrontare mille avventure e a farlo
confrontare con le emozioni più diverse.


Il volume che voglio realizzare è di 72 pagine con
copertina rigida cartonata, interamente a colori.

Il mio stile di disegno (come è chiaramente evidente :D) ha dei forti tratti
nipponici e i colori delle illustrazioni hanno l’importante compito di
esprimere i sentimenti del protagonista durante tutto il corso della storia.    Un regalo speciale per tutti
 
Per
dare maggiore completezza a questo mio sogno ho ideato e sviluppato
un'applicazione: CANVAS TUTOR - che trovate già online!Fin da subito ho deciso di renderla disponibile
gratuitamente a tutti per poter coltivare al meglio la propria passione.
Canvas Tutor infatti è un’app per android utile a chiunque si diletti nel
disegno proponendo esercizi giornalieri per migliorare le proprie abilità in
varie discipline come l’anatomia, la prospettiva, l’inchiostrazione, la
colorazione e il character design. Potete condividere i vostri lavori e
verificare attraverso la gallery i vostri progressi con il disegno.
Inoltre, per chi avrà sostenuto questa campagna permettendo il raggiungimento del traguardo metterò a disposizione un codice da inserire nell'app per avere un contenuto extra in esclusiva!


Perché un artbook è associato a un'app?
Molto semplice, faccio parte di un team indie di sviluppo app, Pimentoso, che
fino ad adesso si è occupato per la gran parte, di giochi android. Inoltre,
lavorando per molto tempo come insegnante presso l’Accademia Europea di Manga
ho pensato di unire queste due attività, ovvero quella dell’insegnamento e
quella dello sviluppo di applicazioni mobile, il tutto incentivando e
condividendo il più possibile la mia passione per il disegno. Spero proprio che
possa aiutare tutti gli appassionati di disegno alle prime armi. Mi raccomando
fatemi sapere, attendo i vostri feedback!

  
Cosa potete comprare
(Lista in aggiornamento!)L'artbook, il silent book: ""Canvas - follow your passion""  La cartolina stampata a colori + il file PSD dell'illustrazione con tutti i livelli aperti per conoscere i vari step di realizzazione.La t-shirt in edizione limitata creata in collaborazione con Kingyo Sukui!Lo sketchbook con la copertina personalizzata!
Una illustrazione originale a colori!

Messaggio speciale per le fumetterie
Sei una fumetteria interessata a Canvas?Qua sotto (e nella colonna di destra) trovi, nella lista dei perk, anche un pacchetto apposito per i punti vendita. Si chiama: PERK RESELLER ed è composto da 5 copie del volume di Canvas e 5 cartoline!
Lista dei perk
 

Per soddisfare al meglio le possibili
necessità e curiosità di tutti ho creato una serie di perk il più variegati possibili dove potrete trovare dall'artbook alle cartoline, da sketch personalizzati a lezioni private.Buona scelta! :D
(Le spedizione dei Perk verranno effettuate a Dicembre 2016)

Come verranno usati i fondi  
Il
traguardo per poter realizzare  questo
mio progetto è stato fissato a 6.500 questa somma verrà così ripartita:


Come nasce il progetto e il perché del crowdfunding 
L'idea
per realizzare questo progetto è arrivata dopo aver passato un periodo molto
difficile per me nel quale, per diversi problemi legati soprattutto ad
autostima e necessità di un'indipendenza economica, avevo pensato di
abbandonare la mia passione, e di smettere quindi di disegnare. Proprio da qui
è nata l'idea di questa storia.Seppur ancora dubbiosa e titubante, mi è
arrivata in seguito la proposta da Linda Cavallini ed Emanuele Tenderini, di
TataiLab, di realizzare qualcosa per loro. Sapere di essere appoggiata ed
aiutata da persone serie che avevano già sperimentato il crowdfunding con altri
progetti come Lumina mi ha dato la convinzione che mi serviva a buttarmi a
capofitto in questa avventura, e non finirò mai di ringraziarli.
Chi è Ilaria?Sono
nata a Firenze con la passione per il disegno nel sangue: fin da piccola
rimanevo ore e ore a osservare mio nonno dipingere. Così, con il suo esempio
negli occhi, mi son ritrovata a passare intere giornate a disegnare “ibbi”
(bambini, nella mia lingua da bimba di 5 anni), passando successivamente al mio
periodo “gattini”.
Alle medie, nonostante la mia insegnante di italiano volesse con tutte le sue
forze che io frequentassi il liceo classico, avevo già le idee molto chiare, e
dopo l’esame di terza media mi iscrissi al liceo artistico di Lucca. 
Durante quegli anni conobbi i manga e lo stile giapponese, e il mio desiderio
per il futuro si trasformò da “da grande disegnerò!” a “da grande diventerò una
fumettista!”.
Per questo, una volta diplomata, mi iscrissi alla scuola internazionale di
comics di Firenze. Insieme alle mie compagne di classe ci buttammo nel magico
mondo delle fanzine autoprodotte, pubblicando “GATTAI!”, la nostra raccolta di
fumetti in puro stile manga. La fanzine mi portò a trovare il mio primo vero
lavoro nell’ambito del fumetto, ovvero l’insegnante presso l’Accademia europea
di manga. Contemporaneamente ho lavorato come dimostratrice per Pentel e Copic
italia, come grafica per giochi mobile e come illustratrice per un film
documentario prodotto da Sky dedicato alla tragedia di Fukushima e alla
questione dell’energia nucleare.

It means a lot to me and the readers if this goal was fully funded.

My father helped me print the first two books and from here on, I want to actually self-publish the rest of the books and I'm glad to see all these crowdfunding websites that pushed the webcomics community and indie artists, in general, to get bigger.</p>

----------
Grey is... is an ongoing slice-of-life series, about two guys; Black (boy in white) and White (boy in black). It started in November 2010 and is +500 pages long so far, and counting.About the comic:

Grey is... have a great supportive audience. I feel very blessed every day. It has been featured on deviantART, has over 1500 readers on MangaMagazine.net, hard copies of Vol1 is almost out of stock and it's being translated and published in Spain starting this year.

It means a lot to me and the readers if this goal was fully funded. Since I started and realized I'm committed to this job, I decided that I want to make a living solely as an indie manga artist and thankfully, my supportive parents stood by my side at the beginning of Grey is... and it got bigger with the support and faith the readers put in the story and me.

My father helped me print the first two books and from here on, I want to actually self-publish the rest of the books and I'm glad to see all these crowdfunding websites that pushed the webcomics community and indie artists, in general, to get bigger.
greyismanga.com || tumblr || Online StorePage Samples:

Grey is the conflict and the balance between the heart and mind in the human soul. Black and White are similar yet so so different and they represent the heart and the mind respectively. Grey is... deals with intense themes like child abuse, self-harm and suicide but it's also about the ways to overcome these obstacles; friendship, love, peace within self and courage to welcome change. 
About the creator:I'm Diana Abbadi, mostly known by my pen name dee Juusan, a 27 years old Jordanian manga artist. This year I was one of the Winner Runner ups in the Silent Manga Audition hosted by the Japanese Monthly Comic Zenon Magazine.My career as a Manga Artist (I mostly go by Manga Artist because manga is the term we use here) started with Grey is... in 2010. It was originally a one shot test to see if this medium is my thing and 3 years later, all I want to do is draw stories 24/7I fell in love with stories even before I learned how to read, back when I was a kid and stories were read and explained by teachers in school. Since then, I knew I wanted to be a storyteller, whether it's novels, comics, poems, prose, animation, or film.And when my love for art grew with my age, choices got fewer and fewer and I realized after graduation college that telling stories as comics is my thing.Read a bit more about me || deviantART || twitter
THE BOOK:






$4000 is 2800JD (Jordanian Dinars).
75% of the goal will cover the costs to print 500 copies of the book. 
The rest will go for: A5 prints + Packaging and shipping costs (Shipped Worldwide using Registered Air Mail) + all fees for 3rd parties in the campaign (Credit Card and Indiegogo)



$500 + $1000 perks will get an exclusive t-shirt





Update: November 10th 20132 Perks have been added for those who want to contribute but are not Grey is... readers:
1. Original Artwork

2. 2 hour Art session (for lessons, critiques, art talk or all)

A5 Prints Preview:
(To check other merchandise rewards descriptions, please visit the online store)(Logbooks will most probably be bought through MangaMagazine.net Marketplace. will be ordered and paid for by me and would arrive separately from your package)

The book will happen.
So, you may have noticed that this campaign is using Flexible Funding, which means I am getting the money raised whether it'd reached the goal or not.
What will happen to the money? 
The people that contributed in the campaign will get the book as agreed. And whatever money I raise, I'll use to print the book with the same quality as the last two. My plan would be, in case the goal wasn't reached, is to print less copies (200 instead of 500) and use any money I get from the online store, the local stores (selling vol1+2), commissions or selling original art to have the book ready in January 2014 to ship as promised.

So, you don't have to worry.
The book will happen. I just wish I wouldn't need to go to extreme measures for it and hope the campaign would be fully funded.
Thank you!

<p><strong>Who - we are?</strong></p>
<p>DPD&amp;Y! is the production and creative team behind the new web graphic novel, The Soul of a Hero.  This new, community-funded web graphic novel will redefine readers’ experience with comics. Created to provide fans what they been looking for and missing…heroic, villainous, tormented and innocent characters, eye-popping art, gripping stories, and real-time interaction with comic creators, The Soul of a Hero hearkens back to the Golden Age of comics where stories mattered while blazing new territory with 21st century technology through the dynamic feedback loop.</p>
<p>The Soul of a Hero reminds us why we fell in love with comics in the first place and takes us to a place we’ve never been. The Soul of a Hero creative team has partnered with <a href=""http://redhandedstudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Red Handed Studios</a> to produce this long-overdue epic.  Red Handed Studios, a small, established independent publisher, is the creator of award winning graphic novel <a href=""http://comicrelated.com/wp_fallenjustice/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FallenJustice</a> and the ongoing web comic series, <a href=""http://www.dynagirlonline.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DynaGirl</a>.</p>
<p>The Soul of a Hero is team DPD&amp;Y!’s first collaborative effort. This fan -driven project expands the ever-growing super hero universe created by Red Handed Studios.</p>
<p>DPD&amp;Y! comprises of  creative amateur comic and graphic novel creators who have a strong belief that comics should be fun, informative and above all else fan supported.  Each member of the team has already worked on independent comic projects that have been published. The team members are big fans of 70’s-ploitation, action movies, comics, and super heroes.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What - we need?</strong></p>
<p>In order to adequately produce this web graphic novel to its full creative vision, DPD&amp;Y! requires $3500 seed money. These funds will cover the operating and production costs associated with creating the comic, including maintaining the website (so the graphic novel can be read for free), marketing collateral and for small stipends for the artists who produce the work.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where - you can see and get the comic?</strong></p>

Once a particular chapter is completed, It will be available for purchase at the online comic store in print or digital format as single issues.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>When -  is the comic coming out?</strong></p>

Created to provide fans what they been looking for and missing…heroic, villainous, tormented and innocent characters, eye-popping art, gripping stories, and real-time interaction with comic creators, The Soul of a Hero hearkens back to the Golden Age of comics where stories mattered while blazing new territory with 21st century technology through the dynamic feedback loop.
The Soul of a Hero reminds us why we fell in love with comics in the first place and takes us to a place we’ve never been. The Soul of a Hero creative team has partnered with Red Handed Studios to produce this long-overdue epic.  Red Handed Studios, a small, established independent publisher, is the creator of award winning graphic novel FallenJustice and the ongoing web comic series, DynaGirl.
The Soul of a Hero is team DPD&Y!’s first collaborative effort. This fan -driven project expands the ever-growing super hero universe created by Red Handed Studios.
DPD&Y! comprises of  creative amateur comic and graphic novel creators who have a strong belief that comics should be fun, informative and above all else fan supported.  Each member of the team has already worked on independent comic projects that have been published. The team members are big fans of 70’s-ploitation, action movies, comics, and super heroes.
        For more on DPD&Y! please see our press release.
 
What - we need?
In order to adequately produce this web graphic novel to its full creative vision, DPD&Y! requires $3500 seed money. These funds will cover the operating and production costs associated with creating the comic, including maintaining the website (so the graphic novel can be read for free), marketing collateral and for small stipends for the artists who produce the work.
 
Where - you can see and get the comic?
You can view the web graphic novel at anytime by visiting its web site www.thesoulofahero.com . There you will also see the project unfold with special online posters and concept art. Once a particular chapter is completed, It will be available for purchase at the online comic store in print or digital format as single issues. Fans will also be able to purchase the complete collector’s edition once the entire web graphic novel is completed.  Shhhh don’t mention the collectors edition to anyone, it’s gonna have all kinds of cool special never seen before stuff in it.
 
When -  is the comic coming out?
The Soul of a Hero is in production. The plan is to post a page a week of the graphic novel until completion. The story is planned to cover chapter issues and each will be available to read FOR FREE on the comic’s website. Don’t worry this ain’t like other projects that sound all cool but never come out.
The projected web publishing date in Late November 2013
 
Why - we need your help?

Note the wording “amateur comic enthusiast.” We are all professional artists and writers but amateur here means that we don’t get paid to do this, nor do we have a defined budget.

Lack of sales from my other finished projects means that this project, and ones like it, take weeks longer to produce than they should, and also that I miss out on major shows and conventions since I'm unable to provide samples of the work. Missing out on shows and conventions costs more than actually attending them, because it means I'm missing out on meeting potential fans and customers, collaborators, even employers, as well as earning an income.
This is my first publicationand I'm really excited about it. I want to give it the best measure of reach I can, and to do that, I need to have copies printed. I would love to have copies of the book on-hand to fulfill orders online and in stores. Further, there are a couple local shows and artist events happening this summer where I can showcase the book.
The Project

One night, during a wild stroke of inspiration, I sat at my computer and began writing the words that would become one of my favorite short stories, The Night Is Our Victory. Clocking in at just seven paragraphs, it told the story of an ambush happening in a forest at night. After sharing it with my friends, I mused about the idea of illustrating it.
The story tells the tale of a group of humans in a night forest who are ambushed by the forest-dwelling people there for gathering up bits of their home (fallen branches and things) to use as firewood on a cold evening. The sylf, the forest people, find them and, after dealing with them, leave the bodies to be reclaimed by the forest and its Fey inhabitants.
Over the span of two weeks, I sat at my drawing table, drawing each image and painting it. The final images were painted on 12 x 16, 140# Canson watercolor paper using Dr PhMartens watercolor inks.
I made a mock-up of the final book for my own visual aid purpose, and researched printing costs and formats. I spent another week putting everything together into its final form. All the pages are formatted, the story is printed at the bottom of each page, and the covers are complete.
Now, it's time to print. The book is complete and simply waits for the funds to be printed. A successfully completed campaign means the following:

100 copies of the book, ready to fulfill orders and store placement
An ISBN and barcode, necessary for store placement
Promotional prints for shows and events
I can print all the books I need, and get an ISBN and barcode. The printed books will be sent to a local store to carry and contributers to the campaign, and shown to other local comic shops and retailers for store placement. I will also have them available in my online shop and for upcoming shows and events.

<h3>Overview <b>개요</b><br/>
</h3>The world of <b>Seoul 2150</b> is dark, dangerous but familiar. It's a world full of people. People never change. They are driven by desire. driven to survive, to get by. When androids were introduced into society, they made in the image of their creators. They also want to survive, they have desires.  Some don't want them to survive. <br/><br/><b>Seoul 2150</b>의 세계는 어둡고 위험하지만 친근하기도 합니다. 수 많은 사람들로 가득 차있죠. 사람들은 절대 변하지 않는답니다. 살아가기 위해서, <span>도태되지 않기 위해 그들은 욕망에 따라 행동합니다. </span>안드로이드가 사회에 처음 소개되었을 때, <span>그들을 만들어낸 사람들의 생각과 완벽하게 부합했습니다.</span> 안드로이드들 또한 살아남길 원했고 욕망을 좇았습니다. 몇몇 사람들은 그들이 죽길 바랬지만요<span>.<br/>
</span><br/><b>Seoul 2150 </b>is a story about competing desires. A desire to search. A desire to control. A desire to live. A desire to destroy.  These desires will be set against a futuristic vision of Seoul, South Korea in the year 2150 but will be little different from the desires we see in today's world. <br/><br/><b>Seoul 2150</b><span>은 욕망을 좇아가고 채워가는 스토리를 보여줍니다. 무언가 찾고자 하는 욕망. 무언가 조종하고 싶은 욕망. 살고 싶다는 욕망. 파괴하고 싶다는 욕망. 이러한 욕망들은 미래 2150<span>년의 서울 속에 만연하지만, 오늘날 우리들의 세상에 존재하는 욕망과는 조금 다릅니다.
</span></span><br/><br/><h3>So what exactly is it? <br/>
</h3>
<h3>
<b>그렇다면</b><b> Seoul 2150<span>는 정확히 무엇일까요?</span></b><br/>
</h3>
<b>Seoul 2150 </b>is a comic that is trying to stretch the mould a little bit. The images in the comic are created through a mix of traditional photography, composition, and some digital illustration. Unlike other comics that use photography in the level of composition and editing done to each photo is much more extensive. Backgrounds are assembled from many pieces, and extensive editing is done to the individuals in the images from retouching to illustration as things like the android parts are added to the characters. <b><br/><br/></b>
<b>Seoul 2150</b>은 일반 만화와는 조금 다른 작품입니다. <b>Seoul 2150</b>은 사진 촬영과 편집 그리고 디지털 일루젼을 통해 만들어지기 때문입니다. 단순히 여러 장의 사진을 엮어 만든 기존의 만화와는 달리, <b>Seoul 2150</b><span>은 더욱 섬세하고 정교한 사진 편집 작업을 거쳐 완성됩니다. 작품 속의 배경들은 수많은 사진 조각들을 엮어 만들어지고, 고도의 일러스트레이션 리터칭 작업을 통해 등장인물들을 더욱 생생한 안드로이드처럼 보이도록
합니다.</span><br/><p></p>For this reason <b>Seoul 2150</b> looks to stand apart from traditional photo comics and webcomics as well. The comic will be produced in a traditional western comic book style of around 30 pages with a cover and splash page. Funds permitting we will do limited runs of hard copies for each issue. In the beginning this comic will run in Korean and English, but other languages are being looked at as well.  <br/><br/>따라서 <b>Seoul 2150</b>은 기존의 사진을 엮어 만든 만화와 웹툰과는 다르다고 볼 수 있습니다.  또한, <b>Seoul 2150</b><span>은 일반적인 서양의 만화 스타일을 따르기 때문에, 매 커버는 30페이지 분량이며 스플래시 페이지를 포함합니다. </span>재정적인 한계가 있는 관계로, <span>한정된 수량만을 출판할 예정입니다.</span> 비록 지금은 한국어와 영어로만
작품이 소개되지만, <span>이후에는 더 많은
외국어로 번역될 예정입니다. </span>

<h3>Who are we?<b> 우리는 누굴까요</b><b>?</b>
<br/>
</h3>
<p>We are <b>Posinoir Comics</b>, a group of many people who have given our time and effort to producing the the first demo issue which will be available to read in both Korean and English. <br/></p>
<p>많은 사람들이 모여 수 많은
시간과 노력을 쏟아 첫 번째 데모 작품을 한국어와 영어로 소개하기 위해 모인 <b>‘Posinoir Comics’</b> <span>그룹입니다.</span></p>
<b>Matthew Cross</b> is a photographer, editor, writer, and digital illustrator. He conceived of the idea about a year ago after testing different kinds of shooting styles and editing in the studio and managed to convince everyone else that this was worth a shot. <b><br/><br/>크로스매튜</b>는 사진작가이며 에디터인 동시에 디지털 일러스트레이터입니다. 스튜디오에서 다양한 스타일의 사진 촬영과 편집작업을 하던 그는 <b>Seoul 2150</b>을 제작해야겠다는 생각을 떠올리게 되었고, <span>이는 다른 사람들의 두터운 공감대를 형성하였습니다. 그리하여 본격적인 작품 제작에 돌입하게 되었습니다. </span>
<b><br/><br/>Kristine Lee</b> is a text book translator by day and, hopefully, about to lead the way in bringing the noir style to the Korean language. While noir themes exist in many Korean films, the speech and narrative style wasn't so easy to replicate. Kristine was able to make the story flow and keep its nuances during translation. <b><br/><br/>Kristine Lee</b>는 번역가입니다. 수 많은 한국영화 속에서 느와르 장르가 소개되었지만, <span>그 말투와 문체는 정통 느와르 스타일을 따라가기엔 조금 무리가 있습니다. </span>Kristine<span>은 <b>Seoul 2150</b>을 번역하며 스토리 전개를 매끄럽게 전개하며 동시에, 느와르만의 뉘앙스를 생생하게 전달했습니다.</span><br/><br/>
We are backed by a host of individuals willing to stand in funny positions or do somersaults while jumping off large wooden blocks onto mattresses over and over just to get a shot. From the main characters to the extras, everyone is ready to do their best. 

<b><br/><br/>Seoul 2150</b> <span>제작에 수 많은 사람들이 자발적으로 참여하였습니다. 참여자들은 나무
상자에서 미리 준비된 매트리스 위로 여러 차례 뛰어내리는 등 완벽한 사진을 촬영하기 위해 노력했습니다. 주인공과 엑스트라 모두 최고의 작품을 만들기 위해 고군분투 했습니다. </span><p></p>

Photographers from time to time will do up a handful photos from a shoot in a comic style, the idea of doing an entire book this way was written off as simply unfeasible. We think we've shown them wrong. Our demo issue covered a wide variety of situations from action, to dialog and from humans to death dealing security drones.

</span>그러나 우리는 그들이 틀렸다는 것을 입증했습니다. 저희들이 소개한 데모버전은 다양한 상황을 생동감 있게 전하는 액션과 대화, <span>무인정찰기와 관련된 죽음과 인간으로 구성되어있습니다.</span>몇몇의 패널들은 주로 사진으로 만들어졌으며, <span>때로는 모두 디지털 일러스트레이션만으로 완성되기도 했습니다.

Overview 개요
The world of Seoul 2150 is dark, dangerous but familiar. It's a world full of people. People never change. They are driven by desire. driven to survive, to get by. When androids were introduced into society, they made in the image of their creators. They also want to survive, they have desires.  Some don't want them to survive. Seoul 2150의 세계는 어둡고 위험하지만 친근하기도 합니다. 수 많은 사람들로 가득 차있죠. 사람들은 절대 변하지 않는답니다. 살아가기 위해서, 도태되지 않기 위해 그들은 욕망에 따라 행동합니다. 안드로이드가 사회에 처음 소개되었을 때, 그들을 만들어낸 사람들의 생각과 완벽하게 부합했습니다. 안드로이드들 또한 살아남길 원했고 욕망을 좇았습니다. 몇몇 사람들은 그들이 죽길 바랬지만요.
Seoul 2150 is a story about competing desires. A desire to search. A desire to control. A desire to live. A desire to destroy.  These desires will be set against a futuristic vision of Seoul, South Korea in the year 2150 but will be little different from the desires we see in today's world. Seoul 2150은 욕망을 좇아가고 채워가는 스토리를 보여줍니다. 무언가 찾고자 하는 욕망. 무언가 조종하고 싶은 욕망. 살고 싶다는 욕망. 파괴하고 싶다는 욕망. 이러한 욕망들은 미래 2150년의 서울 속에 만연하지만, 오늘날 우리들의 세상에 존재하는 욕망과는 조금 다릅니다.
So what exactly is it? 


그렇다면 Seoul 2150는 정확히 무엇일까요?

Seoul 2150 is a comic that is trying to stretch the mould a little bit. The images in the comic are created through a mix of traditional photography, composition, and some digital illustration. Unlike other comics that use photography in the level of composition and editing done to each photo is much more extensive. Backgrounds are assembled from many pieces, and extensive editing is done to the individuals in the images from retouching to illustration as things like the android parts are added to the characters. 
Seoul 2150은 일반 만화와는 조금 다른 작품입니다. Seoul 2150은 사진 촬영과 편집 그리고 디지털 일루젼을 통해 만들어지기 때문입니다. 단순히 여러 장의 사진을 엮어 만든 기존의 만화와는 달리, Seoul 2150은 더욱 섬세하고 정교한 사진 편집 작업을 거쳐 완성됩니다. 작품 속의 배경들은 수많은 사진 조각들을 엮어 만들어지고, 고도의 일러스트레이션 리터칭 작업을 통해 등장인물들을 더욱 생생한 안드로이드처럼 보이도록
합니다.For this reason Seoul 2150 looks to stand apart from traditional photo comics and webcomics as well. The comic will be produced in a traditional western comic book style of around 30 pages with a cover and splash page. Funds permitting we will do limited runs of hard copies for each issue. In the beginning this comic will run in Korean and English, but other languages are being looked at as well.  따라서 Seoul 2150은 기존의 사진을 엮어 만든 만화와 웹툰과는 다르다고 볼 수 있습니다.  또한, Seoul 2150은 일반적인 서양의 만화 스타일을 따르기 때문에, 매 커버는 30페이지 분량이며 스플래시 페이지를 포함합니다. 재정적인 한계가 있는 관계로, 한정된 수량만을 출판할 예정입니다. 비록 지금은 한국어와 영어로만
작품이 소개되지만, 이후에는 더 많은
외국어로 번역될 예정입니다.

The oft-discussed never-yet-published Booty collection is finally happening!</p><p> My name's Anne and I'm an artist based in Western MA. I started an autobio comic in 1995 called booty to document my day-to-day life after finishing college, going to work in the woods for a little while, and then on to graduate school.

<p><strong><br/></strong>Hello, my name is Bec, thank you for taking a look at my fundraiser! I am an aspiring comic artist, and would love to get my career off the ground with my latest comic '<em>Succubitch</em>'.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About <em>Succubitch</em>
</h3>
<p><em><br/></em><em>Succubitch</em> is a comic about Mel, a Succubus that enjoys nothing more than luring out male victims from local strip clubs, and everything seems to be going well, until a rag tag group of angels show up in town and try to steal her work at the club. A scrap over who dances the pole turns into something much more serious. (NOTE: There wont be any explicit content in the first issue of the comic, this means no explicit sexual activity, it will be suggested but at least in the first issue or two there will be no explicit adult content, bar a bit of blood of course). </p>
<p>The first issue I'm hoping will be about 30-40 pages long, and will include Mel, the group of angels (Lolly (Miranda), Sugar (Rebecca) and Candycane (the name's a mystery!)) and a series of male victims who all fall for their tricks and charms!</p>
<p>Depending on how much funding I get, I can either have <em>Succbitch </em>printed in monochrome (similar to the sexy as hell Mel on the pole you cans ee) or B&amp;W (which will still be impressive but I personally prefer monochrome). The cover will be in colour if I get enough funding.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the author/illustrator</h3>
<p>My name's Bec, and I've had a love for art since I was young. I've come a long way from my zombie obsession at eight years old, and I have made a lot of progress with my art, and I'm confident a career in comic art is definitely a path I would like to take.</p>
<p><em>Succubitch</em> will be my first physically printed comic if funding goes well, though I can't work on it full-time just yet. There's a preview of the comic in the image gallery if you'd like to take a peek.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks for looking, and I hope you like the perks!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE: Some extra information about the 'add your character' perks:</p>
<p>Characters must be humanoid, no furry characters (anthro or feral animals), werewolf is acceptable.</p>
<p>Characters must NOT be copyrighted! I will check.</p>
<p>You must provide a reference of your character. Detailed decriptions are fine, but do not blame me if the character does not look as perfect as you were imagining it if all I have to base the character on is words.</p>
<p>Your character can be another succubus/incubus/angel, but this wont grant them a huge part in the story.</p>
<p>No immortality or ridiculously overpowered abilities will be included. Also unless specified you would rather not, the character will most likely die after their feature is over.</p>
<p>Roles can be discussed. </p>

Your character can be another succubus/incubus/angel, but this wont grant them a huge part in the story.
No immortality or ridiculously overpowered abilities will be included. Also unless specified you would rather not, the character will most likely die after their feature is over.
Roles can be discussed.

Ma non possiamo e non dobbiamo fermarci!Noi, come tanti artisti di ogni campo e genere, stiamo cercando di rialzarci. Insieme all'Italia tutta.Con #eroinsieme vogliamo voltare pagina e proprio dietro questa nuova pagina c'è il seguito di un eroe, che, come tante altre storie, il momento storico in cui viviamo ha bloccato. Ma ora è il momento di far venire fuori la sua storia, la storia di ogni eroe e possiamo farlo solo tutti noi. Insieme!Infatti, grazie al tuo sostegno il secondo volume potrà vedere la luce e continuare a raccontare la storia Nino e di una Napoli in subbuglio, teatro di scontri tra forze del bene e del male.E non solo!Sostenere questo progetto significa non solo poter proseguire il percorso editoriale di Capitan Napoli e sostenere il mercato dell’editoria italiana indipendente duramente colpita dalla crisi, ma anche dare un aiuto concreto a realtà che hanno sofferto ancor di più questo periodo di emergenza sanitaria e conseguente isolamento, realtà in cui un abbraccio può fare veramente la differenza.Così abbiamo deciso che una parte del ricavato verrà devoluta alla cooperativa sociale ""Hope”, una casa famiglia costruita per dare aiuto a tanti ragazzi abbandonati dalle proprie famiglie. Anche per questo #eroinsieme ci sembra più di un semplice crowdfunding.Potrai sostenere la campagna scegliendo tra tanti diversi perk che abbiamo pensato per accontentare davvero tutti pensando a cosa vi sarebbe piaciuto trovare in una fiera del fumetto! Potete vedere tutti i perk con i dettagli sia qui a lato che più sotto.Sappiamo che non tutti potranno supportare la stampa di questo secondo volume contribuendo con denaro. In questo caso, potrai sostenere questo progetto anche solo condividendo questa campagna con i tuoi amici e altri fan appassionati di fumetti via e-mail, o Twitter, Instagram, Facebook o qualsiasi altrosocial media che possa aiutarci a spargere la voce il più possibile.

Despite of not making new comics anymore, I am still receiving requests and questions if when I could continue the next episodes.You see, I really like to make more episodes but my current situation has no room for it. The success of this campaign will change all that.(P.S. I took me two years before I was able to get AirsofComics.com back) Contribution BreakdownThe only way for me to focus on making these comics is for me to replace my website development jobs. I can only give it up if I could swap it with something that requires somewhat the same amount work and nearly produce same amount of funds.If you're going think deeply about it, a commitment of making 50 WEEKLY COMIC EPISODES for a WHOLE YEAR is actually a pretty serious job that demands hundreds of hours of accumulated work. I think I placed my current goal way too high, so I present to you below my revised Campaign Mid-Goals which is I believe very reasonable enough. There is no need to reach $3,900 to make this campaign successful and I will keep my promises for those who availed the perks. The number of comics and the frequency of release will however be proportional to the number of sponsors and advertisers committed.My Campaign Mid-Goals


I used to draw my comics using the very old software Corel Draw 11 (2002) and I already lost my copy when my previous laptop gave up years ago. Though I still have my back-up template files, I need a new Corel Draw software so I don't have to re-learn how to draw my next comics on a free open-source drawing tools.
Here is what I am about to buy for $379.95 (plus $29.99 and $5.99 shipping to Asia)...
  www.amazon.com - Corel Draw 6x


I am currently hosting AirsoftComics.com on a shared hosting plan. While my hosting account does a decent job on a low traffic website, its performance suffers a lot when multiple viewers tries to access my site the same time. There were complains that my comics sometimes loads very slowly. 



To solve this performance problem, I am also planning to transfer my web account and file on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) which is more powerful and efficient when it comes to hosting websites. This will cost me $480 a year (plus $120 for a $10/month Cpanel subscription)...
www.fastnext.com - VPS Hosting


What do you get from this?

First of all, you get to enjoy the rest of the webcomic weekly for the whole year of 2014. That is 50 comic episodes to look forward to.


Second, since this is a website that will draw thousand of online visitors, I will give you the privilege to be recognized as a sponsor and an advertiser. If you have a business or an organization that benefits from web exposure, then a link from my webcomic to your target site can really help you with that. Check out my perks at the right, and the related Webcomic Site Layout below.

<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p>Not just a Horror story. Fiend is unique in that there are larger social messages in the guise of a horror story. It explores addiction, PTSD, and the human condition in a way not typical to the horror genre. When there is blood and guts in this story there can also be deeper meanings as well. Those who typically don't like Horror may like this book and those that do, will find what they're looking for and more in the new ""Fiend.""</p>

<p><span>Drake finds himself restrained when he wakes from his self imposed drug induced state. Nothing has been able to keep him from his chemical obsession. Today is no different. He runs from the past that haunts him but today everything is catching up. A booby trapped syringe is injected into his veins. Soon he will find that addiction has a cure. Forced into sobriety, Drake must now face the horrible events that sent him down the path of addiction. He must remember those who did unspeakable things to him. They are criminals and evil men. The injection has another effect. There's a horrible beast growing inside him and it possesses the keys to Drakes fixation. “It” wants control and it knows how to get it.

When Drake reawakens he is returned to his human self but finds there's a heavy price for his new fix. Now he must decide if he will let the monster kill to get his high.

When the haunting memories that he once numbed away, begin to permanently fade away as though they never even happened to him, will he still have the desire to use at all?

<h3><span>ABOUT ME:<br/></span></h3>
<p>My name is Lucas Wade. I've worked a long time to reach the day when I could share the stories I need to tell, but just when I thought the stars had aligned for me the unthinkable happened. A large part of every book that I had worked on for over 10 years was taken from me in a burglary. From what I can piece together from the information I've received, It's very likely that the art was all burned to hide the evidence. Either way I was told by the court system that apart from a small sketchbook that was recovered, I wouldn't be getting anymore back.</p>
<p>Imagine your dream being ripped away from you. Every time you put the pencil to paper, something deep in your gut tightens up in a visceral response because all you can think about is all that lost time and effort. You can't stop thinking about strangers going through all of your things and just taking whatever they want as they destroy anything they don't. Helping me by supporting this project would mean the world. If everything happens for a reason than you are here reading this for some reason right? Maybe it's to help set things right! Please contribute in anyway you can.</p>

The Story:
Not just a Horror story. Fiend is unique in that there are larger social messages in the guise of a horror story.

Those who typically don't like Horror may like this book and those that do, will find what they're looking for and more in the new ""Fiend.""
Synopsis (for the entire series including books still to come)
Drake finds himself restrained when he wakes from his self imposed drug induced state. Nothing has been able to keep him from his chemical obsession. Today is no different. He runs from the past that haunts him but today everything is catching up. A booby trapped syringe is injected into his veins. Soon he will find that addiction has a cure. Forced into sobriety, Drake must now face the horrible events that sent him down the path of addiction. He must remember those who did unspeakable things to him. They are criminals and evil men. The injection has another effect. There's a horrible beast growing inside him and it possesses the keys to Drakes fixation. “It” wants control and it knows how to get it. It taunts Drake with ""another way."" Drake is given a taste but in an unconscious state the monster takes over. Drake's body takes the form of the monstrosity living within. When Drake reawakens he is returned to his human self but finds there's a heavy price for his new fix. Now he must decide if he will let the monster kill to get his high. He decides those responsible for his torment wont be true victims at all. Drake begins using his adversaries to replace the drugs that once got him high and for the same effect.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Radio Comix is a small-press comic publisher that was formed in 1997 to publish anthropomorphic, independent and American manga comics. For the last fifteen years, we have continued to publish our mainstay anthologies Furrlough and Genus, as well as dozens of other comics and graphic novels. The company was formed by two people, Elin Winkler (me) and Pat Duke, with assistance from Will Allison and Christina ""Smudge"" Hanson. Though Pat departed in 2007, Will and Christina stayed on and the company has continued publishing as a threesome. Everything needed to run the business is done by Elin, Will and Christina- editing, book layout, website design and maintenence, mail order, invoicing, promotion, bookkeeping, etc. We all work day jobs and do Radio Comix work in our off time, because we are passionate about the comics and graphic novels we produce. Never an enormous financial success, we've always kept the company running on a shoestring budget, rolling any money made into the next round of published books. The last few years in particular have been increasingly difficult, what with the loss of indie distributors Cold Cut Distribution and Haven Distribution- we moved quite a lot of backstock through both those channels, and now are left with only Diamond Comics to distribute our titles to the wider market. We're making inroads in self-distribution, but it's a slow, incredibly time-consuming process. We have always operated on a razor-thin margin, and that is why we are currently in such a financial bind.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Trouble</h2>
<p>I stated in the previous paragraph that the three people at Radio Comix do everything there- well, everything except the business taxes. Due to a horrible oversight on the part of our (now former) accountant, we now owe a staggering amount of back taxes. The total is truly shocking, and when I first discovered it, I was ill for days. I've been working for three months with a new accountant to get everything that wasn't filed taken care of, but filing does not equal paying and now not only do these freshly filed taxes have to be paid, but there are penalties due to the late filing. I'm a firm believer in filing and paying all my taxes, and finding out I was behind was my worst nightmare come true. I have been working with the IRS to come up with a payment plan, but if we could get a large lump sum together to pay in at one time, it would be an enormous help!</p>
<p>Not only would a lump sum for the IRS help me sleep again at night, it would also go a long way towards helping our company continue operations. I have spent the last fifteen years of my life pouring all my energy, time and yes, even my personal money into Radio Comix, just to keep publishing. When the comic industry had tough times, I went out and got retail day jobs or took on freelance work to keep everything going. I would be devastated if I had to declare bankruptcy over this tax issue, especially since we've weathered so many ups and downs in the industry thus far. Also, our many, many talented artists would lose their publisher- artists like Shon Howell, Joe Rosales, Christina ""Smudge"" Hanson, Will Allison, Matix, Mark Moore, DAQ, Zel, Terrie Smith, Heather Bruton, Diana Harlan-Stein, Phil ""Poinko"" Gibson, Steve Gallacci and many more! I have always only published artists whose work I believed in and whose work I personally enjoyed. I firmly believe all our artists, though they aren't mainstream in the slightest, deserve to have the wider exposure professional comic publishing can offer them. It has always been my greatest joy when a new reader discovers one of our artists and falls in love with their work. And, it has always kept me going despite the hard times, knowing that there are readers out there who believe in our crazy dream enough to buy one of our books.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Difficulty in Asking for Help</h2>
<p>I understand that Radio Comix isn't a mainstream comic company. We're not even the traditional sort of high brow indie comic company. We publish anthropomorphics and American manga, which one could argue aren't the coolest things in cool town. But we have incredibly loyal, incredibly supportive fans who recognize that our books are made for the pure love of making them. These are the stories all of us here are compelled to tell, and thanks to Radio Comix, we have a platform to continue telling them whether it be via print or via our webcomics site.</p>
<p>Many other anthropomorphic publishers and artists have gone through the fan community, begging for help whenever they have had the slightest upset. I always swore I would never, ever be that person and thus far, I have never asked our fans for help. However, this is the day that has finally made me crack; the thought of losing this company that I have worked so hard on and that I have poured all my passion for comics into is a fate I can't stomach. So, please, if you can, help. Any little bit is welcome.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What This Money Will Go For</h2>
<p>Straight up, 100% of any money raised via this campaign will go directly to the IRS. It's not an exciting or glamorous thing to pay for, but keeping the IRS paid and happy means Radio Comix can keep operating. That means we can keep publishing comics and graphic novels, keep our websites up and running, keep selling at conventions. We're asking for $4000. The actual amount we owe to the IRS is much, much higher than that, but I would not feel comfortable asking for more than the amount I've asked for. Heck, I'm not even really comfortable asking for this amount! If we don't reach our goal, whatever amount we raise will be applied to our tax debt anyway. If we exceed our goal, whatever amount we raise will be applied to the tax debt! None of this money will be used for anything other than paying off the IRS- it's my number one goal in life now to get that debt paid off so I can keep my company going for another fifteen years, or at least until there's no such thing as comic books anymore.</p>
<p>A friend suggested that I reveal the full amount the IRS wants from us (back taxes, penalties and interest), in the interest of transparency. That total is $40K. I would never expect such a huge amount to be crowd-funded, and would never presume to ask for the full amount. But, should we go over our goal, by any amount, we would just be that much closer to paying off this debt.</p>

A world where society has fallen to nuclear war, governments are powerless and subcultures reign supreme. The comic follows main protagonist Soaka as he embarks on a mission to rebuild his 'lab' after being torn from his past life and into this stark, harsh reality.Contributors are needed to make this idea a reality, funding is needed for printing, marketing and distribution and that's where you come in. You can help me take this comic from my computer's desktop and into the real world.What's needed?I'm asking for a total of $1000200 x First issue                                             - $517.5050   x Limited edition Micro issue                    - $129.371     x Domain name                                        - $39.991     x Web hosting                                          - $59.991     x Silver signature pen                               -$61     x Social Network Advertising Campaign - $247.15Any donations are welcome and every contributor will receive a special thanks in the credits!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

I love comics. It's one of the purest forms of storytelling there is. The creative team doesn't have the same budgetary constraints that, say, television and film producers do.

At some point life becomes work, bills, family, Little Timmy's soccer game, and back to work on Monday. Adults stuck in the everyday struggle don't dare to dream anymore. Comic books, and the stories within, are that escape into the wondrous; they make us feel young again. They can make you weep at the death of a beloved character or whoop in delight as the hero conquers his or her greatest conflict.

<h3>Let Me Explain -- No, There Is Too Much. Let Me Sum Up.</h3>
<p>My name is Matt Nelson, and I've been drawing comics pretty much ever since I could pick up a pencil. When webcomics came onto the scene, I started putting my stuff online, first with a Transformers parody comic called Super Deformers, and then with a comic about students at a Lutheran college called Pewsitters. I eventually went as far as I could with those comics, but never lost my love for the artform.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, I've started getting back into the comics scene, and that brings me to Catbeard the Pirate.</p>
<p>Catbeard is something that combines my love of cats and adventure comics, and with Catbeard, I try to put forth the fun that I think a lot of comics lack these days. It's high seas fantasy with an incredibly silly twist, and it's a comic that really brings me a lot of pleasure to write and draw.</p>
<p>Your contribution is pretty awesome to me for one simple reason: it gets you my finished first volume of Catbeard, and it makes it available to others. I love it when people read and enjoy my comic! It's a huge rush, and it makes me want to do more so they can read more.</p>
<p>Sure, there's lots of other things that are great about supporting independent comics and their creators, but there are other people who can explain that better. Right now I just love doing this comic, and I'd love for you to have a copy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>My Loot Is Your Loot</h3>
<p>Here's where your money goes:</p>
<p>Printing and shipping the books, and creating any extra material incentives. Really, that's it! The book is done, the printer has all the files, I just need to fund a print run so I can have some books for comic conventions, and some stock for the website so folks can order in the future. While I'd love to finance it all personally, my cat eats a LOT (okay, so do I... Geez, I need to get out of this art chair!)</p>
<p>If I don't meet my goal, I'll still print my books - I'll just have to curtail my order sharply. But wouldn't it feel great to help <em>way</em> more people read about a pirate with a cat on his face? Sure it would!</p>
<p>If I exceed my goal, I'll print more books, and maybe buy a tiny bit of ad space in a few strategic places. Gotta spread that pirate comic goodness around!</p>
<p>I'm asking for a small amount because I figure it's realistic. Heck, all I'd need is roughly 67 people at the $15 donation amount to make my goal! Odds are, YOU know 67 people who might want a fun comic!</p>

<h3>Hi, I'm Jason Brubaker and this is my new COMPLETE comic called <i><strong>Sithrah</strong></i>.</h3>
<p>I've worked as a professional <strong>Storyboard Artist</strong>, <strong>Animator</strong> and <strong>Visual Development Artist</strong> in Hollywood for 20 years on movies like <strong><i>Blade, Pitch Black</i></strong>, and the <i><strong>Kung Fu Panda</strong></i> Trilogy. In 2015 I quit my coveted and cushy job at <strong>Dreamworks Animation</strong> to pursue self-publishing my own graphic novels and I've been doing it ever since. My first graphic novel series is called <i><strong>reMIND</strong></i> and it won a few awards. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560280082/ulcq2q1vifvxuhvvotdy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Sithrah 5 - 176 pages</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sithrah 6 - 208 pages </strong></p>
<p>Sithrah is a project very close to my heart. It is a journey about <i>""the Leap of Faith""</i> of a little girl who travels in and out of the spirit world to try to find her missing father. It is heavily inspired by my love for <strong><i>Miyazaki's</i></strong> movies but with a western worldview. </p>
<p>For this final campaign, I am printing the last 2 books in the series. The artwork is complete and pretty much ready for the printer. The last 2 books contain a total of 380 full color pages.</p>
<p>Best of all, the final book is not scheduled to be released until the end of 2020 and so <strong>only backers</strong> will be able to read the full story without having to wait for the release date. <strong>If this campaign does really well and we sell out of copies,</strong> <strong>you will be the ONLY PEOPLE who will have copies of Sithrah 5 and 6</strong>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560456535/ntp8wekn227le8w0zgga.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The only reason I am able to print these high quality books is because of you. You guys have come through for each campaign and made it possible for my crazy stories to get published. You are my <i>financiers, friends, editors, collaborators, inspiration, motivation, mentors</i> and <i>marketing partners</i>. I could not have done any of this without you. You have changed and blessed my life in so many ways on this 5 year journey to complete Sithrah and I cannot thank you enough for helping me get these books made and onto coffee tables around the world.</p>
</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560456591/zpfvlkhy2wid176edh1e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>50% off of my entire back catalogue.</h2>
<p>Indiegogo exclusive! I am slashing the prices on all my old books for this campaign. This will be the cheapest price that you will be able to purchase <i><strong>Sithrah</strong></i> or <i><strong>reMIND</strong></i>. That means that you can get the entire <strong>Sithrah 6-book hardcover set for as low as $99</strong>. </p>
<h3>Get Sithrah 6 a YEAR before anyone else!</h3>
<p>The release dates for each book is spaced out by a year for retailer orders and Amazon orders. That means that <strong>only you</strong> will be able to read the final Sithrah book <strong>a year and a half before it's release date</strong> and 6 months early for Sithrah 5.</p>
<p>And if we sell all of the print run in this campaign then it means that you will be the ONLY ones who have a copy and I not release it in stores or on Amazon. Why would I limit the print run? Because the previous books only had a print run of 2500 copies and in order to print more copies of Sithrah 5 &amp; 6, I would also have to reprint Sithrah 4, 3 and 2. And since I don't have that kind of money laying around I will not be reprinting those older books again.</p>
<h3>Win Exclusive Gifts</h3>
<p>You are my marketing experts! I need your help in spreading the word to all your friends and family and in return I will give you exclusive gifts and rewards. Watch the video below to see just how easy it will be to get something unique from this campaign like a sticker, art print or original inked page from the books.</p>

<h3>Art Contest - Get Your Art Printed in the Book!</h3>
<p>Just like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed books. And so… ART CONTEST!!! Submit your art while the campaign is active to get a chance at getting it published in the gallery of Sithrah: Book 5 or 6.

Please send all submissions to CoffeeTableComics@gmail.com for consideration. I'll pick the final winner(s) for the book. :)</p>
<h3>Add-Ons</h3>
<p>I will be offering Add-ons when you take the survey after the campaign is finished. You will then have the option to add single books to your order as well as copies of reMIND and other books of mine at a discounted price. Because there are already so many books and options with this campaign I decided to keep the Add-Ons separate. But not to worry, you will have the option of adding things to your order prior to shipping.</p>
<h3>Timeframe</h3>
<p>The books are pretty much ready to go to the printer. I'll be preparing the files in InDesign while the campaign is active. The moment the campaign is finished I will deliver the files to the printer. The printing schedule will be about 2 months and so you will get your books before Christmas. International orders might take a little longer. </p>
<h3>Why so Much Money?</h3>
<p>I've been making beautiful hardcover graphic novels for 10 years now. <i><strong>Sithrah: Books 1 - 4</strong></i> have already been printed with high quality cloth bindings, foil stamped covers and thick delicious paper. Yes, I said delicious. </p>
<p>To wrap up this series, I am trying to print the final two books at the same time. It usually costs about <strong>$12,000 to $15,000</strong> to print just one book like this, and not only am I printing two books, I plan to make a <strong>collectors slipcase</strong> as well. The shipping costs have been anywhere between <strong>$8000 to $30,000</strong> on my past campings and so that is why my funding goal is <strong>$45,000</strong>. If I don't reach this goal then you will be refunded and the books will <strong>not</strong> go to print. But I am confident that we can easily make this happen.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've launched 6 successful crowdfunding campaigns over the years, raised and fulfilled nearly $400,000 in orders. I am very familiar with the whole process and what it takes to make and deliver on a big or small campaign.</p>
</div></div>","Hi, I'm Jason Brubaker and this is my new COMPLETE comic called Sithrah.
I've worked as a professional Storyboard Artist, Animator and Visual Development Artist in Hollywood for 20 years on movies like Blade, Pitch Black, and the Kung Fu Panda Trilogy. In 2015 I quit my coveted and cushy job at Dreamworks Animation to pursue self-publishing my own graphic novels and I've been doing it ever since. My first graphic novel series is called reMIND and it won a few awards. 
Sithrah 5 - 176 pages
Sithrah 6 - 208 pages 
Sithrah is a project very close to my heart. It is a journey about ""the Leap of Faith"" of a little girl who travels in and out of the spirit world to try to find her missing father. It is heavily inspired by my love for Miyazaki's movies but with a western worldview. 
For this final campaign, I am printing the last 2 books in the series. The artwork is complete and pretty much ready for the printer. The last 2 books contain a total of 380 full color pages.
Best of all, the final book is not scheduled to be released until the end of 2020 and so only backers will be able to read the full story without having to wait for the release date. If this campaign does really well and we sell out of copies, you will be the ONLY PEOPLE who will have copies of Sithrah 5 and 6. 

The only reason I am able to print these high quality books is because of you. You guys have come through for each campaign and made it possible for my crazy stories to get published. You are my financiers, friends, editors, collaborators, inspiration, motivation, mentors and marketing partners. I could not have done any of this without you. You have changed and blessed my life in so many ways on this 5 year journey to complete Sithrah and I cannot thank you enough for helping me get these books made and onto coffee tables around the world.


50% off of my entire back catalogue.
Indiegogo exclusive! I am slashing the prices on all my old books for this campaign. This will be the cheapest price that you will be able to purchase Sithrah or reMIND. That means that you can get the entire Sithrah 6-book hardcover set for as low as $99. 
Get Sithrah 6 a YEAR before anyone else!
The release dates for each book is spaced out by a year for retailer orders and Amazon orders. That means that only you will be able to read the final Sithrah book a year and a half before it's release date and 6 months early for Sithrah 5.
And if we sell all of the print run in this campaign then it means that you will be the ONLY ones who have a copy and I not release it in stores or on Amazon. Why would I limit the print run? Because the previous books only had a print run of 2500 copies and in order to print more copies of Sithrah 5 & 6, I would also have to reprint Sithrah 4, 3 and 2. And since I don't have that kind of money laying around I will not be reprinting those older books again.
Win Exclusive Gifts
You are my marketing experts! I need your help in spreading the word to all your friends and family and in return I will give you exclusive gifts and rewards. Watch the video below to see just how easy it will be to get something unique from this campaign like a sticker, art print or original inked page from the books.

Book Specs.
Sithrah 1: Kingdom of the Air -  96 pages
Sithrah 2: Propositions - 160 pages
Sithrah 3: The Symbol - 188 pages
Sithrah 4: The Deep - 176 pages
Sithrah 5: Light City - 176 pages (NEW)
 Sithrah 6: The End - 208 pages (NEW)
Only 500 copies of the new books have a signed and a numbered collectors bookplate.

Art Contest - Get Your Art Printed in the Book!
Just like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed books. And so… ART CONTEST!!!

The page dimensions are 6.75 inches (wide) x 10.5 inches (tall). Please make sure all art is 300dpi when scanned. The deadline for submission is the end of the campaign. Please send all submissions to CoffeeTableComics@gmail.com for consideration. I'll pick the final winner(s) for the book. :)

THE WILD WEST AS YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE

Jaxon Cage, a boxer of the Crown, Melanie McHall, an American student, a lawless town and ancient people protecting their land…From the metallic London sky, to the cloudless landscapes of North America, across two continents: powder and bullets, trickeries and treasures, subjugated souls and guardian spirits.
This is the story of the man who would change HISTORY!

 Il selvaggio West, come mai visto prima!
Jaxon Cage (un pugile londinese), Melanie McHall (una studentessa americana), una cittadina senza legge ed un antico popolo che protegge la propria terra...
Dai cieli metallici di Londra, ai paesaggi incontaminati del Nord America: un viaggio che attraversa due continenti. Fra polvere e pallottole, acciaio e sangue, fra Anime soggiogate e Spiriti guardiani...
Questa è la storia dell'uomo che può cambiare la Storia!



How we realize this amazing digital comic?
For which concerns the contents we have drawn upon historical and anthropological sources to be later embedded in a fictional context.


Man Born Again is released in online instalments: just like a TV series! Divided into 3 seasons, each of which will focus on the Italian actor Giuliano Gemma (Jaxon Cage) as the main character, next to many other artists, such as Moses Brings Plenty.





 Come viene sviluppato Man Born Again?
I contenuti e le tematiche affrontate nella storia, prendono spunto da documenti storici ed antropologici, autentici e originali, applicati in un contesto finzionale (fiction).
Man Born Again viene pubblicato in formati digitali, adatti a qualunque ebook reader e qualunque dispositivo digitale.
Proprio come una serie televisiva, il fumetto si divide in tre stagioni, ognuna delle quali vede come protagonista Jaxon Cage, interpretato dal noto attore italiano Giuliano Gemma, accanto a molti altri personaggi, ispirati o interpretati da molti altri artisti, come Moses Brings Plenty.



Why the Western genre needs Man Born Again?
Man Born Again is a comic, yeah we know it. But it isn't JUST a comic.
The story is grounded on historical documents and the spirit of the Lakota Sioux culture permeates all the novel.
Thanks to the expert advice by Dr. Alessandro Martire, president of the Wambli Gleska association we have transported, in our comic, the Lakota culture, without filters! 




Every single pencil's sign means something... will you able to understand all the messages, hidden in the Man Born Again's panels, in the story's events and in the narration? Don't worry, if you need, the spirit of the wolf will guide you ;)
Check ""Something about the Comics Experience 4.0"" for more details.

 Perché il genere Western ha bisogno di Man Born Again?
Man Born Again è un fumetto, fin qui ci siamo... ma non si tratta SOLO di un fumetto.
La storia si basa su documenti e reperti storici dell'Europa vittoriana e dell'America colonialista.
Grazie alla consulenza del Dr. Alessandro Martire, presidente della Wambli Gleska association abbiamo potuto trasportare in questo fumetto anche la cultura Lakota, senza filtri di alcun genere, per narrare le vicende che sono accadute e quelle che, nel bene o nel male, sarebbero potute accadere.
Ogni singolo tratto di matita ha precisi e definiti significati... sarete in grado di individuare tutti i messaggi nascosti nelle tavole di Man Born Again? Niente paura, se non ci riuscirete, lo Spirito del Lupo vi guiderà alla scoperta di antichi simboli e nuovi significati. 


Why Man Born Again needs you?
Even though Man Born Again is a digital comic, it is expensive realize it, in order to give our readers an innovative product, in line with new technologies.
Since two years ago we have supply our work's costs... but now we want to realize the comic in a better way: more professional, more fast!
So, we have choosen the flexible campaign and we will carry-on anyway. Your help will allow us to do our work in the greater possible manner.
When this campaign will be ended, we'll start work on the episode #2, titled ""Death travels by train"" and, when it will ready, we'll started another campaign, for the episode #3, and so on!


 Perché Man Born Again ha bisogno di voi?
Sebbene Man Born Again sia un fumetto in digitale, è veramente costoso realizzare un'opera di questa portata, soprattutto se vogliamo garantire ai nostri lettori un prodotto innovativo, sempre in linea con le nuove tecnologie.
Da due anni a questa parte, abbiamo provveduto noi stessi al finanziamento del nostro lavoro, ma ora vogliamo realizzare questo fumetto in maniera più professionale e, soprattutto, più rapida!
Per questo abbiamo scelto il tipo di campagna flexible e continueremo a lavorare indipendentemente dalla cifra raggiunta. Il tuo aiuto è indispensabile per permetterci di lavorare nel modo migliore, rendendo il nostro fumetto la migliore opera digitale in circolazione!
Terminata questa campagna inizieremo a lavorare all'Episodio #2, intitolato ""La morte viaggia in treno"" e, quando sarà pronto, procederemo ad una nuova campagna di crowd funding per finanziare l'Episodio #3, e così via... 




How we'll spend the funds:

9500$ will used for perks, shipping and indiegogo and paypal fees
500$ for the translation from italian into US english
2000$ will spend in order to create the iPhone and iPad Apps and to make it free to download, without advertisement and with free uploads!
3000$ will used to upkeep our sites and online services and to promote our comic, worldwide and for organization and participation in special events, such as exhibits, fairs, etc...
 5000$ will spend in order to reinforce our team and, we hope, to translate Man Born Again in Spanish and Japanese languages! And, maybe, to pay an english speech course :)

This campaign is worldwide, US$ payment are required!
For currency convertion, check this site!

9500$ saranno usati per creare i perks (quello che otterrete in cambio del vostro finanziamento), per le spese di spedizione (sempre a nostro carico!) e per pagare le commissioni a Indiegogo e Paypal.

<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Greetings, my dear fellows. Thank you for taking the time to visit. <br/><br/>Wayside Creations presents Blackgold, a science-fiction animated web comic!<br/><br/><h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Wayside Creations is a group of extremely talented young filmmakers based out of Los Angeles, California whose only goal is to entertain and have fun while doing it. Though most of Wayside hails from different backgrounds, they have come together as friends, roommates, and co-workers to create blockbuster films and outstanding digital media. Their YouTube page, which details some of their excellent work, can be found here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/WaysideCreations"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/user/WaysideCreations</a><br/></p>
<br/><h3>What is Blackgold?<br/>
</h3>
<p>The idea that eventually grew into Blackgold started as nothing more 
than a single sentence on a piece of notebook paper. It has taken me 
over a year to develop and nurture that one sentence into an ambitious 
undertaking that has succeeded in consuming my life. It was initially slated to 
be a science fiction novel of around one thousand pages, but I soon realized that this story could 
not be confined to the pages of a book. It would have to be unique, with
 worlds and creatures the written word cannot do justice. So, I enlisted the help of 
some of my closest friends and family and came up with the idea of an 
animated web comic.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Blackgold is presented as Seasons of twelve five to ten minute long episodes, each fully voice-acted and sound designed with limited and stylized animation. The comic itself will be featured on its own website (<a href=""http://www.blackgoldcomic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.blackgoldcomic.com</a>) and on YouTube. As of now, only Season One is ready, pending additional funding and/or adoption.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plot<br/>
</h3>
<p>Blackgold takes place in the far distant future on an alien world 
called  Marratt, where human beings co-exist with a race of reptilian 
humanoids called ""rygar."" The humans have carved out a slice of 
existence on the continent Jenowa, while the rygar remain in the same 
place they have been in for thousands of years: the island nation of 
Rygara. In this world, the humans are much like their earthbound 
ancestors, while the rygar are a strict, militaristic culture with a 
polytheistic system of beliefs and a theocratic system of government. 
Color plays an important part of their culture: gold is considered all 
that is good, while black is considered the hue of death.</p>
<p>Sixty-two years ago, a black rygar was born in the capital city of Rygara, a megalopolis called T'Ali. Believing the child to be a demon, he was exiled to Jenowa, 
forever banished before he was a week old. Now, the black rygar has 
grown up into a strapping young man named Ky'Tal Tsune. For fifteen of 
those years, he has been an assassin, driven by a powerful subconscious 
force he calls ""The Drive"" and a desire to know more about his missing 
past. Opposing him is the corrupt and malevolent ruler of Rygara, Zetar,
 the man who put him where he is and who will stop at nothing to ensure Ky'Tal meets his end before his own 
dark secret can be revealed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It is a story full of action, intrigue, back-stabbing, suspense, and colorful characters.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Such a project is not an easy undertaking. This is where the funding 
comes in. I am going to not only need webspace to distribute the comic, 
but also money to pay my very dedicated and talented crew with. They 
have put their own sweat and blood into this to develop it, and they 
deserve to be rewarded for their time and effort. But most of all, the 
money will help me develop the story beyond what's written into 
something perhaps far greater. Friends we may be, but we can't afford to keep doing this for free. The $1,500 I'm asking for during this campaign will pay Mr. Finfrock for his time, as well as my entire cast for the time and effort they will be putting into this project in order to bring it to life. Even if we don't make our goal, we're still going to move forward with our project. Every little bit helps, in that regard.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What are we offering for your generous contributions? Take a gander below:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you offer $5, you will receive a unique sticker of Blackgold's stylized logo, along with our heartfelt thanks.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you offer $15, you'll receive the digital line art of one of Blackgold's characters, which will be signed by the artist and the voice actor portraying the character, as well as a Blackgold sticker. Your art will be printed on high-quality card stock and will be ready for framing.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you offer $30, you'll receive everything listed above along with a frame for your drawing. The selected voice actor will also record a special thank-you message specifically for you. You will also be granted an appearance in the comic as a background character!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you offer $50, you will receive everything already mentioned, except now your drawing will be a full-color digital print that will be signed by the creator, the artist, and the voice actor portraying the character.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you offer $100, you will receive a heartfelt thank you video from the creators of the comic, recorded specifically for you, as well as a framed digital print of the two main characters, plus the line art of a character of your choice. This is all on top of what you've already seen listed above!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you offer $200, you will receive everything already mentioned, along with a two-of-a-kind poster of the entire Blackgold cast of characters, signed by the entire team. You will also be rewarded with a walk-on role in the comic! We will discuss the specifics with you via e-mail when the time comes. This particular perk only has two slots, so get them before they're gone!</p>

<p>All of our perks will be sent at the end of the campaign.<br/></p>

<h3>The Broad Pitch</h3>
<p>In the Universe of Earthbound there are 13 Sponsors across the galaxy.  They recruit the greatest contenders on each planet and submit two every four years to the GGPT, Galactic Grande Prix Tournament. They hold a draft every year for an exclusivity contract, so other Sponsors won't compete for the same contenders.  But once you draft a contender, you still have to go out and recruit them.  A subclass of warriors emerged to make a living specifically on the task of recruitment, known as headhunters.  Even headhunters are often compelled to do their job by blackmail and threats of punishment.  Freedom is not guaranteed, even Free Will is not guaranteed. </p>
<p>Spaceman and Julia are sent to Earth to recruit the Sirens of Violence, four deadly warriors hiding out. Whoever recruits more of the four shall earn their freedom.  In the case of a tie, Wiz Kid, their ex-teammate who happens to be stranded on Earth, will be the tie breaker.  Wiz Kid was recently drafted by the 13th Sponsor.  He is a very late draft pick but he's also a Dark Horse, one Handler in the 13th ward has a mysterious high stakes bet on him.</p>
<p>The big idea that everyone likes behind this story is the R-types.  The R-types are weapons that jack the targets free will.  Headhunters use them to recruit Contenders.  But the Sirens are extremely deadly.  Spaceman and Julia will have to recruit other warriors on Earth first, enlist their help, and then go at the Sirens.  It plays out in really fun ways, for example later in the story (this isn't a big spoiler i promise) one of the headhunters needs a car to get somewhere fast, so they stop the nearest car that approaches and shoot the driver.  It happens to be a soccer mom.  So a soccer mom is on their team for the rest of the story at that point, driving them around like a badass.  One could also shoot cops, hell you could shoot the President but you might have to shoot some other targets first.  It's a fun concept.  The different strategies Spaceman and Julia utilize is telling of their character.  Just how the R-types work is slowly revealed through the story. </p>

<p><strong>Hey, I'm Narwhal</strong></p>
<p>  I'm very passionate about indie comic books and hope to make a living writing and drawing them soon.  I've floated on the outskirts of the industry for years now, some pro work here and there.  Earthbound is a great way to introduce my style to the world.  It's been three years in the making, and the process of writing goes back further, into my twenties.  I'm always trying to master story structure more and more.  Earthbound represents my attempt to be really efficient, every scene is multi-tasking and building on the whole.  I want it to feel brisk and compelling as you read it, and I can't wait to share.</p>
<p>Earthbound's greatest influence is the movie Battle Royale (2001) by Kinju Fukusaku.  In Battle Royale, the players are all set up quickly and the meat of the movie is just this deadly game-scenario playing out.  The Strategy Is The Story, I like to say.  Stories like this allow you to focus on the characters, alliances, friendships, romance, heartbreak, betrayals, sacrifice, tragedy, and levity during moments of repose, as opposed to the plot.  The plot is these things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Free Will: Truth or Dare</strong></p>
<p>A big theme in Earthbound: BTBOE is Free Will.  I've heard from some smart people that Free Will doesn't actually exist.  But we have this concept of losing it, as shown throughout popular media: The Borg, for example.  How could we lose it if it wasn't a thing in the first place.  Throughout Earthbound every character is fighting for their own Free Will with their life.</p>
<p>Earthbound is intended for ages 16 and up.  I dare you to read it if you're 15!</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Narwhal Comics is looking for 4000k as a campaign goal to fund a limited edition signed print run, and top ramen.  The funding will also help continue the story.</p>
<p>I did everything on this comic, writing, art, coloring, lettering, layout.  I had some help with editing (Thanks Avid!).  It is a true indie comic.  I hope it stands out and reinforces the fact that the modern indie comics movement is really special.</p>
<p>I've crowdfunded in the past but this is the project I'm the most excited about, a full graphic novel.</p>
<p>Personally, the goal for me is to transition to doing this more and more, and away from my day job.  I slice meats at the local Fred Meyer for the upper echelon of society, the meat-buyer, the elites gotta have their salty meats.  They send out personal shoppers with chihuahua service dogs to fetch them their precious salty meats.  All the time they hide behind an iron curtain of anonymity.  Who are these mysterious elites who need daily salty meats sliced?  And entire infrastructure exists underneath them to ensure they get the salty meats.  We mustn't have a meatless elite class, no sir.  I'm a pillar of society.  Somebodies gotta do it, but I'd rather be drawing comics.  If I'm good enough, then I deserve to, that is my goal, and I present to you Earthbound: BTBOE.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Strange News from Another World will present innovative computer graphics combined with unique alternative press cartooning to present concepts and ideas  focused on the social and spiritual evolution of human society in the 21st century. Often when new or controversial ideas are presented to corporations and investors, they are rejected not for lack of merit or  commercial potential, but for political or personal agendas. We are pleased to announce that this project will not be abandoned for lack of financial backing. We have secured distribution with Diamond distributors. </p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The total cost for the last book was $12,756.00 for 5,000 books plus promotional postcards. We will print books by demand this time in units of  1000 to get books out ASAP.</p>
<p>Therefore our goal is to raise a modest $3,000 to finance the first print run. We will do whatever necessary to get the books out! However, with your support the books will be made available much sooner. We offer some fun perks to inspire you.</p>

<h3>Micro Mob the drawing</h3>
<p>The Mob is an A3 drawing made in six weeks during July and August this year.

#ComicBookArt_V_Cancer
At the end of 2011 Issy's courageous battle (the 15 yr old daughter of a good friend diagnosed with cancer of the spine) inspired the 3hundredand65 project where I tried to teach myself to draw in a year by making a comic book on Twitter one day at a time one tweet at a time http://story.3hundredand65.co.uk/  Last year I fell in love with comic book/graphic novel art. So far 3hundredand65 and the Mob have made over £25,000 with book sales and the auction still to come in 2014 all through drawings whose heart belongs to comics.

Hello,<br/>I'm
R.S.  SHESTO, The Creator of IWMFH.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Genisis:</b></p>
<p>
Ever
since I had basic motor skills, I aspired to create. I always
challenged my level of creativity, From drawing my very first
comicbook when I was 6, to fronting my first band when I was 16. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>My
Mother was my main support system, having encouraged me to sing,
write poetry, and model. She took me on my first tour and even funded
my projects.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Trials
&amp; tribulations:</b></p>
<p>
In
2008, she lost her battle with leukemia... It damn near killed me as
well and I became selfish, reckless, and irresponsible. Following
many personal and family crises, I went on emotional professional
hiatus. I lost every friend I ever had and became the proverbial man
in the box with my every creative endeavor. last year I was bedridden
unless i had obligations to fulfill. My Father was diagnosed with a
rare and terminal form of cancer in mid August of 2013. My depression
worsened, I became more bitter and morbidly defeated.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Resurrection:</b></p>
<p>
When
I finally accepted the fact that I was going to lose my Father, I
remembered how valiantly my Mother fought to simply take another
breath. I was Hellbent on enjoying every millisecond I had left with
my Father and continuing to be artistic. Now resurrecting a corpse is
a process and anything but glamorous. so I began by writing songs,
studying,  working out, laughing, etc. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Creation:</b></p>
<p><i>
On
October 31st of 2012,</i></p>
<p>
I
wrote a story where Halloween was celebrated year-round but was
ironically forbade. Fortunately I put it on the side for more
developement.</p>
<p><i>
On
October 31st of 2013.</i></p>
<p>
I
created a character inspired by my favorite comic book characters and
band mascots. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This
character would become Peponaugh Cavatus Fool'sfire.</span></p>
<p>
The
creative process was nearly a 2 year long search for perfect artist
to bring Peponaugh to life. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">All
i had was my concept, a written description and some rough character
sketches.</span></p>
<p>
I
began developing IWMFH 6 months ago and I only had a brief back story
for Peponaugh.</p>
<p>
Then
I was approached by an indie movie maker and my Father encouraged me
to write a screenplay. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This
was the push I needed to begin writing Peponaugh's elaborate origins. B</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">efore
I knew it, I had an entire world of characters, each with their own
unique names and identities.</span></p>
<p>
Soon
after, I enlisted the help of my friend and co-writer Gayle
Tomasello. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I
was utterly amazed by how well she could see my vision.  </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It's
as if she reads my mind.</span></p>
<p>
We
began writing in the 1900's part of the story but recently decided to
open with the present.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b>Interpretation:</b></p>
<p>
Due
to the fact that I do not have Internet access, it was very difficult
to find the right artists. However, I was fortunate enough to have
found a piece of Nick Nestor's work and my friend and editor Leah
Cardimona contacted him. Nick helped us bring Peponaugh, Flora, The
Jackal Lantern and our logos to life, word for word from my written
description. For months now, he has worked steadily with us as our
character concept artist and illustrator and consultant. </p>

<p>            <i>The trials before getting the final illustration by Nick</i></p>
<p> We recently
somehow managed to find RJ Gonzalez. Gonzalez has done work for DC,
Marvel and currently is employed as an inker for IDW Publishing. His
interpretation of characters, while different are equally as
impressive and accurate. </p>
<p>Nick and RJ have the patience of saints
considering a lot of communication is by mail and phone. It is truly
an honor to have both of these phenomenal artists involved with
IWMFH. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Aggregation:</b></p>
<p>
IWMFH
is comprised of a diverse group of consultants from the United States
to Athens, Greece. Lead By myself, our editor- Leah Cardimona and our
project coordinator- Stephanie Spike Drewa, we have already exceeded
our own expectations. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>
Conclusion:</b><br/>IIWMFH
is by no means ""<i>just a comic</i>.""</p>
<p>
 It
has so many artistic aspects, from comics to music, movies to
theatre. 
</p>
<p>
I
sold most of my musical equipment and personal belongings for chump
change to get this project started. 
</p>
<p>
It
was something I told myself I would never do because of sentimental
value and music having been my main passion since I was young.
However, sometimes we wake up from one dream to live another. This is
the most elaborate, exciting and Innovative project I've ever been
involved in.. And despite the struggles, I am certain this project
will be ridiculously lucrative franchise by as soon as next year.</p>
<p>
Please,
allow us to tell the elaborately compelling, beautiful yet disturbing
story of I Was Myself For Halloween. Every contribution will be
greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
Thanks
for your time and ultimately for your support.</p>

<p>I'm Gayle Tomasello, I'm one of the writers for I Was Myself For Halloween.</p>
<p>I was first inspired to write by my sister when I was a teenager. My first scribblings were quite deplorable, but hey, we've all got to start somewhere. </p>
<p>When I am writing, I'm inspired by the wind around me, the trees, the green grass, thunderstorms and candlelight. They put me in a place where I can delve deep inside myself and reach for thoughts and ideas that wouldn't necessarily occur to me.

</div></div>","Hey guys, This campaign is sadly over, however we have another one running to continue our goal of bringing this amazing comic to life.  So please check it out and the new fun perks.
igg.me/at/IWasMyselfForHalloween
Short Summary
The creative team of I Was Myself For Halloween is enlisting the help of our fans to tell the story of Peponaugh C. Fool'sfire though a comic book.  
This elaborate story is dark and disturbing yet beautiful and 
compelling.  It takes place in the early 1900's and continues in present
 day.   
The comic itself is sent in present day New York. It follows Peponaugh C. Fool'sfire as well as other unique 
and intricate characters in a world where Halloween is forbade due to several gruesome unsolved murders.
This is our stepping stone to invite you to follow him into a world where Halloween is year round. 

Our ultimate goal is to create a series of graphic novels, movies, a band and a theatrical horror opera.

What We Need & What You Get 
Our Goal is $5,000.   Funds are required to employ a former DC/Marvel artist and current IDW Productions Inker to render 22-26 pages of drawings to bring our comic book to life.  We will also need to cover printing physical color copies of the comic and shipping fees.  Anything received over and above our goal will go towards merchandise.
*Update*
         Ladies and Gentlemen Let us present our Covers! We decided to have a variant cover. 

       

*Update*
Here are two choices for the posters, one from each of our artists, Nick Nestor and RJ Gonzalez.  If you chose the perk with the signed poster, it will be signed by the artist as well as the creator.  

  By Nick Nestor,  freelance illustrator          


By RJ Gonzalez,  former DC/Marvel & current IDW artist

*Update*
The hoodie option.

About Me's were dictated by phone and mail by the person and typed up

The Creator

Hello,I'm
R.S.  SHESTO, The Creator of IWMFH.



Genisis:

Ever
since I had basic motor skills, I aspired to create. I always
challenged my level of creativity, From drawing my very first
comicbook when I was 6, to fronting my first band when I was 16. 

 
                                                 Drawings from first comic Fill

My
Mother was my main support system, having encouraged me to sing,
write poetry, and model. She took me on my first tour and even funded
my projects.





Trials
& tribulations:

In
2008, she lost her battle with leukemia... It damn near killed me as
well and I became selfish, reckless, and irresponsible. Following
many personal and family crises, I went on emotional professional
hiatus. I lost every friend I ever had and became the proverbial man
in the box with my every creative endeavor. last year I was bedridden
unless i had obligations to fulfill. My Father was diagnosed with a
rare and terminal form of cancer in mid August of 2013. My depression
worsened, I became more bitter and morbidly defeated.





Resurrection:

When
I finally accepted the fact that I was going to lose my Father, I
remembered how valiantly my Mother fought to simply take another
breath. I was Hellbent on enjoying every millisecond I had left with
my Father and continuing to be artistic. Now resurrecting a corpse is
a process and anything but glamorous. so I began by writing songs,
studying,  working out, laughing, etc. 




Creation:

On
October 31st of 2012,

I
wrote a story where Halloween was celebrated year-round but was
ironically forbade. Fortunately I put it on the side for more
developement.

On
October 31st of 2013.

I
created a character inspired by my favorite comic book characters and
band mascots. This
character would become Peponaugh Cavatus Fool'sfire.

The
creative process was nearly a 2 year long search for perfect artist
to bring Peponaugh to life. All
i had was my concept, a written description and some rough character
sketches.

I
began developing IWMFH 6 months ago and I only had a brief back story
for Peponaugh.

Then
I was approached by an indie movie maker and my Father encouraged me
to write a screenplay. This
was the push I needed to begin writing Peponaugh's elaborate origins. Before
I knew it, I had an entire world of characters, each with their own
unique names and identities.

Soon
after, I enlisted the help of my friend and co-writer Gayle
Tomasello. I
was utterly amazed by how well she could see my vision.  It's
as if she reads my mind.

We
began writing in the 1900's part of the story but recently decided to
open with the present.

 1920's Peponaugh
Interpretation:

Due
to the fact that I do not have Internet access, it was very difficult
to find the right artists. However, I was fortunate enough to have
found a piece of Nick Nestor's work and my friend and editor Leah
Cardimona contacted him. Nick helped us bring Peponaugh, Flora, The
Jackal Lantern and our logos to life, word for word from my written
description. For months now, he has worked steadily with us as our
character concept artist and illustrator and consultant. 


                   


                         


            The trials before getting the final illustration by Nick
 We recently
somehow managed to find RJ Gonzalez. Gonzalez has done work for DC,
Marvel and currently is employed as an inker for IDW Publishing. His
interpretation of characters, while different are equally as
impressive and accurate. 
Nick and RJ have the patience of saints
considering a lot of communication is by mail and phone. It is truly
an honor to have both of these phenomenal artists involved with
IWMFH. 




Aggregation:

IWMFH
is comprised of a diverse group of consultants from the United States
to Athens, Greece. Lead By myself, our editor- Leah Cardimona and our
project coordinator- Stephanie Spike Drewa, we have already exceeded
our own expectations. 




Conclusion:IIWMFH
is by no means ""just a comic.""

 It
has so many artistic aspects, from comics to music, movies to
theatre. 


I
sold most of my musical equipment and personal belongings for chump
change to get this project started. 


It
was something I told myself I would never do because of sentimental
value and music having been my main passion since I was young.
However, sometimes we wake up from one dream to live another. This is
the most elaborate, exciting and Innovative project I've ever been
involved in.. And despite the struggles, I am certain this project
will be ridiculously lucrative franchise by as soon as next year.

Please,
allow us to tell the elaborately compelling, beautiful yet disturbing
story of I Was Myself For Halloween. Every contribution will be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks
for your time and ultimately for your support.
Writer


I'm Gayle Tomasello, I'm one of the writers for I Was Myself For Halloween.
I was first inspired to write by my sister when I was a teenager. My first scribblings were quite deplorable, but hey, we've all got to start somewhere. 
When I am writing, I'm inspired by the wind around me, the trees, the green grass, thunderstorms and candlelight. They put me in a place where I can delve deep inside myself and reach for thoughts and ideas that wouldn't necessarily occur to me. I sit at my desk with a pen in my hand and blank pages before me, trying to conjure up characters and events that truly capture the imagination. 
Writing for this project has been very satisfying creatively. I'm working with so many people with extraordinary talents. It's a rare gift to be able to create something so astounding, so mesmerizing and so rich in detail. 
This has been one of the most creative times in my life. I feel very privileged to be writing for this project with my long time friend, R.S. Shesto. We work very well together and have a strong mutual respect for each other's opinions and ideas. Our creative flow meshes together well and we have written some of the best writing I have ever done. I'm extremely proud of the work everyone has done for I Was Myself For Halloween.

<h2>Petit zoom sur La BD</h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>AZVALTYA c’est quoi l’histoire?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ça se déroule dans un monde onirique (on dirait un rêve!). Mais les événements ont un double sens: cette histoire est une parabole qui fait allusion à notre vie intérieure, nos pensées, nos émotions et notre spiritualité.<br/>Sur sa route, Marcel, (le personnage principal), rencontre amis, potes, amours, mais aussi trahisons et impasses. Ses problèmes sont devenus un fardeau qu’il traîne péniblement derrière lui.

L'Atelier Auderset présente sa nouvelle BD!
Salut les amis! Et bienvenue sur notre nouvelle campagne 2021. L'Atelier Auderset, c'est qui? Alain Auderset fait de la BD depuis plus de 27 ans. Auto-édité et auto-financé, il a vécu un incroyable parcours qui lui a permis de mettre en place une joyeuse équipe. Aujourd'hui, une petite dizaine d'employés apportent leurs touches à ses projets et forment l'Atelier Auderset.
Alain est un ami de Dieu. Il est pourtant allergique à la religion, n’est à la solde d’aucune église, secte ou mouvement particulier. C’est juste un artiste qui aime son Créateur et les gens. Sa foi est basée sur la Bible. Reportage sur France 2
AZVALTYA, c’est quoi le projet?
C’est la nouvelle saga BD d’Alain Auderset, une histoire à suivre sur plusieurs albums.Deux tomes sont déjà disponibles sur shop.auderset.comA.Auderset et son équipe ont quasi terminé le tome 3, reste plus que des finitions et l'IMPRESSION.

La création d’un jeu

Pas l’imitation ou l’amélioration d’un autre jeu déjà existant, mais une création originale.Pour l’occasion, l’Atelier a engagé Nicolas Poitevin, un créateur de jeu fraîchement sorti d’une école de Paris avec la Licence Pro de Game Design. Ce projet a été pour toute l’équipe de l’Atelier un gros boulot de plusieurs mois, mais un big kiff pour un résultat de qualité.
Une BD d’Azvaltya 3 est comprise avec le jeu, et le tout tient dans une belle boîte.

Petit zoom sur La BD
AZVALTYA c’est quoi l’histoire?
Ça se déroule dans un monde onirique (on dirait un rêve!). Mais les événements ont un double sens: cette histoire est une parabole qui fait allusion à notre vie intérieure, nos pensées, nos émotions et notre spiritualité.Sur sa route, Marcel, (le personnage principal), rencontre amis, potes, amours, mais aussi trahisons et impasses. Ses problèmes sont devenus un fardeau qu’il traîne péniblement derrière lui. Il est paumé dans un monde fantastique, peuplé de fleurs géantes, de montagnes en colère, de monstres et de routes vivantes et psychologiquement instables.
Marcel se croit seul, mais c’est faux! Car le créateur d’Azvaltya en personne veille sur lui, (un peu comme Dieu pour nous). Et les embûches que permet cette entité sur le chemin de Marcel sont, en fait, des marques d’affection de sa part - même si seul le lecteur s’en rend compte. voir la BA du tome 1
Dans le Tome 2 , le créateur franchit un cap relationnel en approchant Marcel davantage. Il cherche son cœur et pénètre son âme, pour y attiser la foi et éveiller sa soif d’absolu. Il met Marcel face à lui-même et ses incapacités, pour tenter de le sauver de lui-même.
 

 
AZVALTYA 3, les profondeurs
Dans ce nouveau Tome, Marcel se pose enfin les bonnes questions. Mais Jays (un mystérieux pote qu’il a pris en stop), en bon pédagogue, va le laisser trouver les réponses par lui-même, car dans le fonds, Marcel sait déjà, sans savoir.C’est ainsi qu’il va à nouveau être confronté au sentiment amoureux. Des monstres seront combattus par des fleurs. Des conceptions vont s'écrouler et Marcel (ainsi que le lecteur) va découvrir une nouvelle dimension aux choses et au sens de la vie.
AZVALTYA, le but
Sans négliger le fun et le divertissement, le but est de faire réfléchir. Comme à son habitude, A.Auderset essaye de réveiller le lecteur à des questions existentielles vitales et spirituelles.Ce genre d’histoires fantastiques et originales, très en vogue dans le milieu de la BD, permet d’atteindre un grand public avide d'aventures.Azvaltya a le don de sensibiliser à la question de notre âme, de nos sentiments contraires et paradoxaux, du sens de nos vies, d’un au-delà, et d’un Créateur bienveillant. Invisible lorsqu’on ne le cherche pas, il nous aime et nous cherche avec passion.
 
Petit zoom sur le jeu
 
Pourquoi ce jeu?
Azvaltya, les anges gardiensToucher les gens sur des questions vitales et spirituelles avec fun et divertissement est un leitmotiv de l’Atelier Auderset.
En effet, en plus d’un amusement ludique, ce jeu de plateau et de coopération a un but existentiel. Il force le joueur à réfléchir et philosopher sur sa propre vie. Le “pourquoi Dieu permet de telles choses ?” trouve ici une réponse et permet un nouveau point de vue.
 

Comment ça marche?
Marcel de la BD doit traverser le plateau, tout comme nous des étapes de la vie. Il avance au gré de ses envies et émotions du moment, sans trop savoir où ça va le mener.Le Créateur, qui tient à son bonheur, a nommé des anges: les joueurs. En fins stratèges, ils sont chargés d’arranger des circonstances favorables sur son chemin. Parfois, obligés de le faire passer par des épreuves à court terme, ils lui imposent des détours pour lui éviter de se planter.Mais difficile de prévoir l’attitude de Marcel qui… Rââââ quelle prise de tête ! En plus, le temps est limité !!!On ne sait pas pour les anges, mais ici, pour les joueurs, c’est tendu, défiant et marrant. Jeu, rire et sagesse
Le temps d’une partie, nous avons le point de vue d’en haut. Nous comprenons mieux que certaines épreuves sont bénéfiques. Les pleurs d’aujourd’hui peuvent mener à la joie, et nous laisser porter par nos envies conduire à des situations critiques. On relativise avec philosophie.Ici-bas, nous avons une vision limitée des choses...mais heureusement, là-haut, quelqu’un veille sur nous. Soyons à son écoute.

I've been making my own comics for years now, but haven't ever published them. This is my first attempt at publishing a webcomic and updating it steadily. I don't have any money to spend on the hosting fees, however, and need donations to make it the first year. </p><p><i>ThunderHead </i>is an adventure comic about a girl with extraordinary powers finding herself and her friend stuck in a world of ordinary things, and their race to get home before someone gets hurt. It's like <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, except in this case Alice is the magical one, and she falls through the rabbit hole into the boring world beyond. </p><p>If you want to have a look at my comic so far, here is the website: <a href=""http://thunderheadcomic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>www.thunderheadcomic.com</a></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I need to have enough money to steadily pay for hosting services, software, and sketchbooks (which I use to sketch out the comic and its special pages).

I am a 17 year old in high school, and making this comic is my passion. I've been making my own comics for years now, but haven't ever published them. This is my first attempt at publishing a webcomic and updating it steadily. I don't have any money to spend on the hosting fees, however, and need donations to make it the first year. ThunderHead is an adventure comic about a girl with extraordinary powers finding herself and her friend stuck in a world of ordinary things, and their race to get home before someone gets hurt. It's like Alice in Wonderland, except in this case Alice is the magical one, and she falls through the rabbit hole into the boring world beyond. If you want to have a look at my comic so far, here is the website: www.thunderheadcomic.comWhat We Need & What You GetI need to have enough money to steadily pay for hosting services, software, and sketchbooks (which I use to sketch out the comic and its special pages). All of these together can cost up to $1000, if I buy quality materials. The money that you donate will help me cover those costs.As far as perks go, there are several options:

 the first 2 people to donate $10 or more will receive a sketch commission of a character of their choice. 


The first person to donate $25 or more will receive a lineart print of a character of their choice. 


The first person to donate $50 or more will get a commission of anything  valuing $50 or less from my commissions page on my blog. 


The first person to donate $100 or more will receive a commission of anything on my commissions page. 

If you claim a perk, please email me at epiphanyontoast@gmail.com and tell me! It's hard to get in contact if you don't have an indiegogo account. If I don't reach my goal (which was actually supposed to be $300, not $1000), I'm still going to use as much as I can towards paying the hosting fees. The ImpactCreating comics and telling stories is my job. In fact, its my mission in life. If I can't spend my time entertaining people with my hard work, I don't know what else I can do to make a difference in this world. I want to inspire others to tell their own stories, as well. Comics and literature have a power to connect people and introduce ideas. I want to be a part of that.

Then we will make the newly remastered tracks available both digitally and in a swanky new physical double CD version!NOTE:This isn't O Captein! My Captein!, which we released as part of our 2012 campaign. It's newer, and bigger.NOTE 2:If you previously purchased the Auditory Assistance digital album from our Bandcamp store, don't worry, we know who you are, and will make sure you receive a jolly discount off the digital version of Auditory Assistance Remastered. IS IT, LIKE, FINISHED?It's, like, 90% finished. We're putting the final polish on the designs of both the Tour Guide book and I, ANNET, editing all the words and waiting for the last few illustration commissions to float in. The music has been complete for quite some time, but we have spent the last few months going over each individual track, and the album as a whole, to use the techniques and skills we've improved over the years to make them really shine. We also have comprehensive quotes for most of the stages of publication including printing, fulfilment, audio mastering, etc. IMAGINE I PLEDGED SOME CREDITS: DO I GET ANYTHING?Depending on the size of your pledge, we're offering to deliver a plethora of different things from simple and accessible digital files, through signed books, to Super Special Deluxe Crunchy Welcome Packs full of things we think will delight and entertain you. Also, everything in between. Let's go through them:£6: DIRECT-TO-BRAIN DOWNLOAD£12: WISH YOU WERE HERE£18: FUN-SIZE SPECIALS£25-35: ARTEFACTS£35: EXHIBITS (SOLO) - NEW!£40: SPECIAL CRUNCHY SKETCHES - NEW!£53: ARTEFACT SPECIALS£75: ARTEFACT ALLIANCE£100: EXHIBIT GALLERY - NEW!£100: WRITER'S DELIGHT£125: EMPLOYEE WELCOME PACKAGE£250: DIRECTORATE TOURIST WHY IS THIS MONEY NECESSARY?You might have seen us at various conventions, but don't mistake us for a giant international corporation: we are a tiny outfit based in Ontario and the UK and, while our ambitions are huge, our cash reserves are not. We're certain you know about the principle of economy of scale, so let's just say our scale is tiny. If we're going to make this exciting new thingy come to life, we need a little help from you, our esteemed fans. So if you like what you've seen, heard and read so far, please consider pledging a few of your hard-earned credits and we will endeavour make it very worth your while.HOW WILL MY CREDITS BE USED?Your credits will go directly towards manufacturing and shipping your perks. Our initial goal is not designed to deliver any profit to us, only to take care of the issues of economy of scale (see above!). If we exceed our goal, our plans are flexible enough to handle the extra scale we could then achieve, and left-over funds can be reinvested in current and future projects. Some elements (like audio mastering) are fixed, and others are directly related to the volume of items required. WHAT IF IT ALL GOES BUM?Actually, that's really unlikely. We have relevant experience of launching, running, completing and fulfilling campaigns like this going back to 2012. We made mistakes at first, but over time we have become very good at what we do, and we're confident that we won't let you down. We also have ongoing cashflow from conventions and online sales that can, if necessary, provide a temporary cushion to get us through any financial difficulties.Any delays or hardships are most likely to come from printing and manufacturing partners, or from illness or injury (for instance, if an illustrator's eyeballs popped out). If anything like this happened, which would be beyond anyone's control, we'd bring you regular updates to keep you informed as we work to resolve them.At this stage we're legally obliged by Paypal's terms to advise you that, while we will do our absolute best to deliver on all our promises, we can't guarantee perks will be delivered. We have to say this to satisfy our legal requirements, and it has no bearing on our intention to ship you your perks! WHO, WHAT AND WHEN IS ROMANTICALLY APOCALYPTIC?Romantically Apocalyptic is a webcomic begun in 2009 by Vitaly S. Alexius. It contains crafty and dark humour, a tense, dramatic story arc, and a small crew of apocalypse survivors with complex, interwoven relationships with each other and the end of the world. The art style is a combination of high-resolution photo-manipulation and cinematic digital painting. It is totally free to view online at www.rom.ac and if you like it, please consider coming back to support us. :)Follow the adventures of Captain and Snippy on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and via a comic convention near you!",29.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>GEP's Story</h3>
<p>GEP was born in the early hours of a working week, to the parents of insomnia and creative freedom. It weighed a healthy ∞ imagination. Its first word was “gaga”.</p>
<p><br/>Most creative people, who are not self-employed, feel the longing for creative freedom at one point in their careers. That feeling kept me up at night until I decided to put pen to paper and start GEP.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is GEP?</h3>
<p>GEP (Gojo Entertainment Presents) is an anthology comic book series. Each issue contains one or more short stories. The stories are all fiction and include action, adventure, sci-fi, horror, fantasy, crime, drama and super heroes.<br/><br/>GEP aims to keep readers entertained through the use of interesting, unique, creative and exciting stories, and excellent and varied art. It strives for continuous, good quality.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Issue 1</h3>
<p>Issue 1 contains 3 short stories, which I wrote and illustrated. The stories are available to read on GEP's website, and can also be purchased in digital and printed form.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Issue 2 (or “I can't do this alone”)</h3>
<p>If only one person contributes to a creative project then it will be creatively limited. The first issue had good stories, but the art was lacking. So I decided to work with good artists, while I focus on writing. I started saving up money to hire artists for issue 2. And I am glad I did! It has been a great pleasure working with such talented artists.<br/><br/>7 stories have been completed for issue 2, all of which are available to read on GEP's website. Only 1 more story left to complete for issue 2. Almost there.<br/><br/>The digital version of issue 2 will be available at the end of February, and the printed version will be available by the end of March 2011.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Issue 3 and GEP TPB Volume 1</h3>I have started planning stories for issue 3, and will start on the scripts within the next week.

</div></div>","GEP's Story
GEP was born in the early hours of a working week, to the parents of insomnia and creative freedom. It weighed a healthy ∞ imagination. Its first word was “gaga”.
Most creative people, who are not self-employed, feel the longing for creative freedom at one point in their careers. That feeling kept me up at night until I decided to put pen to paper and start GEP.


What is GEP?
GEP (Gojo Entertainment Presents) is an anthology comic book series. Each issue contains one or more short stories. The stories are all fiction and include action, adventure, sci-fi, horror, fantasy, crime, drama and super heroes.GEP aims to keep readers entertained through the use of interesting, unique, creative and exciting stories, and excellent and varied art. It strives for continuous, good quality.


Issue 1
Issue 1 contains 3 short stories, which I wrote and illustrated. The stories are available to read on GEP's website, and can also be purchased in digital and printed form.


Issue 2 (or “I can't do this alone”)
If only one person contributes to a creative project then it will be creatively limited. The first issue had good stories, but the art was lacking. So I decided to work with good artists, while I focus on writing. I started saving up money to hire artists for issue 2. And I am glad I did! It has been a great pleasure working with such talented artists.7 stories have been completed for issue 2, all of which are available to read on GEP's website. Only 1 more story left to complete for issue 2. Almost there.The digital version of issue 2 will be available at the end of February, and the printed version will be available by the end of March 2011.

Issue 3 and GEP TPB Volume 1I have started planning stories for issue 3, and will start on the scripts within the next week. The illustrations for each script will start as soon as I have enough funds to hire artists.I am hoping issue 3 will be completed by the end of April 2011. The digital version will be available first, and the printed version about 4 weeks after that.GEP TPB (trade paperback) Volume 1 will contain issue 1, 2 and 3. The TPB will be available in print about 2 weeks after issue 3 is available in print.Why do you need $2700?This is based on the amount of $2100 which I spent to produce issue 2, plus extra to cover printing and shipping perks to funders, plus the 4% fee for IndieGoGo and the 3.9% fee for Paypal.How will the money be used?The money will primarily be used to hire artists for issue 3, and to print and ship perks to funders.What if you don't meet your $2700 goal?I will take the same road I took for issue 2, by saving up money. But this time it will take much longer, as my monthly expenses have increased. Any funding received will be greatly appreciated, and it will make the journey easier.What if you make more than $2700?The extra funds will contribute to future issues, starting with issue 4.What's the comic like?It is awesome, filled with brilliant art and unique and creative ideas!

<h3><strong>Cerebus No. 1, the 1977 original as it was intended to be seen!</strong></h3>
<p><i><strong>""I have waited 43 years to see Cerebus No. 1 the way it was supposed to look. Thanks to Sean Michael Robinson and The Waverly Press that wait is now over."" - Dave Sim, 2020 </strong></i></p>
<p>In December 1977, Deni Loubert published <i>Cerebus</i> No.1, Dave Sim's comic book that followed the adventures of a short-tempered, barbarian Aardvark. Originally conceived as a parody of Barry Windsor-Smith's masterfully illustrated <i>Conan the Barbarian</i> (which was a big hit for Marvel Comics in the 1970's), Sim quickly found his own voice as a storyteller and illustrator, developing elaborate story-arcs which would span dozens of issues. The 1980's saw the popularity of Cerebus explode, igniting a revolution among self-motivated artists and storytellers who were looking for ways to go it alone. Dave Sim helped pave the way for countless other self-publishers of the day, including Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>, Bob Burden's <i>Flaming Carrot,</i> and Jeff Smith's <i>Bone</i> to name a few... Along the way, <i>Cerebus</i> cemented its place as one of the most intelligently written, entertaining, and influential comic books of all time! The original <i>Cerebus</i> No.1 was printed on newsprint paper and after 43 years, most of the few examples that have survived are typically found in lower grades. This new edition is presented with beautifully remastered art, prepared by master digital restoration artist Sean Michael Robinson, for stunning crystal clarity! </p>
<p><strong>Due to the popularity of Cerebus, original 1977 copies of the first issue now command thousands of dollars, putting them out of reach for most collectors. </strong></p>

</div></div>","I've animated on some of the most unique films of the 1970s & 1980s and want to share some of my drawings and behind the scene experiences with you!
Here is the front cover and some sample interior pages:

 


 
 

I’ve been a classical 2D pencil-on-paper animator for 45 years. I’ve always enjoyed capturing quirky personalities with my pencil; and now I want to share some of my favorite character drawings by presenting more than 80 of them in a large-sized 80 page 8.3 x 11.7 inch landscape portfolio...
...but I need your help to get the funding to lay out and print the book.
The following are more samples of the sketches I'll include:
I animated the first appearance of Boba Fett in the Star Wars Holiday Special.

I animated on the cult classic feature ROCK & RULE...

The characters I focused on were:

Cindy the Rollerskating Disco Princess, 
Officer Quadhole,
 Mylar the Club Owner.




AND one of my favorite projects I animated was the always entertaining four BATMAN ZELLERS commercials.

<p>We came up with the idea for this comic when we were both just a few months out of college.

<p>We're asking for funding for two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) to fund the printing, shipping, and promotional costs of producing hard-copy comics, stickers, and posters - $1,500</p>
<p>(2) to fund and support the artistic labor necessary to illustrate the second issue - $3,500</p>
<p>The central item is a high-quality printing of our very first issue. We've seen the publisher's proof, and we can report that it's a gorgeous and glossy product. For those interested in supporting the campaign a bit more, we're also offering additional perks including posters, stickers, and for the true connoisseur, original artwork on canvas by Ben Marlowe.</p>

<p>My current drawing tablet is 6 years old, large, heavy, and on its last legs. My goal is to upgrade to the very portable Cintiq Companion, shipping by Wacom this October.</p>
<p>This upgrade would be HUGE to me, as the majority of my drawing is done digitally, with a Wacom Cintiq 21UX, purchased in 2006. The Cintiq Campanion takes this giant <i><b>essential piece of drawing equipment</b></i> and packages it in a 14"" Windows 8 tablet.</p>

<div class=""clear""><em><strong>About the</strong><strong> s</strong><strong>tory:</strong></em></div>
<div class=""clear"">
<p>Salta is a four limited issue action comic that tells the story about archaeologist Guinevere Hinz (Salta) who spent most of her early life assisting and learning the profession from her late grandmother, who was greatly renown in the field.  Guinevere continued to carry on the family trait in honor of her grandmother.</p>
<p><img alt=""Page 1 "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10990669/Salta%20Comic%20Page%201.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But by an unknown twist of fate, during her field of work, Guinevere stumbles across a mound-like tomb that channels the celestial abilities of the mythical god, Atlas.  During thorough research, Guinevere discovers that dark evil deities from multi dimensions, often in the disguise of humans, have been trying to gain possession of Atlas' powers for ages in an attempt to destroy the universe based off their ultimate evil plans.</p>

<p>After further research, Guinevere discovers that there was no coincidence of her discovery of Atlas' tomb and that she is celestially linked to the powers, giving her a right to posses them, manifesting extra abilities such as time traveling, unnatural strength, astral projection and many more.</p>

<p>Realizing the universes are in danger by the deities she harness the powers and takes on the mantle of balancer for both the celestial and terrestrial plains, becoming her alter ego ""SALTA.""  Spell the name backwards...  ;-) </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Why the revamp of female superheroines?</strong></em></p>
<p>I love storytelling and happen to be a great fanatic of characterization.  Throughout the years I've been waiting anxiously for more strong female heroines.  They're a few in other comic universes that has influenced the thought, but not as many as I would like to see.   </p>
<p>I will like to add to the entourage with a strong character of my own.  With this approach, I would like to contribute more to the famous quote, ""Story First.""     </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>How will the money be used?</em></strong></p>
<p>Please help us raise $6,500 to cover the cost of artwork for my creative team.  This include penciling, inking, coloring, lettering, etc.  It will also go toward printing and shipping copies of the comic &amp; rewards to all donors. </p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, all donors are still guaranteed to get as your reward.  But let's take it to further heights and reach the goal!  :-) </p>

</div></div>","About this project
I'm Julian ""Jay"" Burton.  I am a filmmaker and story designer and I want to publish a comic that I've been writing for over two years.  I'll need funds to pay my art team for the artwork of the first issue.  Indiegogo is the place to help this project.  Thanks for your incredible support and please consider donating to help this project. 
 
 
About the story:

Salta is a four limited issue action comic that tells the story about archaeologist Guinevere Hinz (Salta) who spent most of her early life assisting and learning the profession from her late grandmother, who was greatly renown in the field.  Guinevere continued to carry on the family trait in honor of her grandmother.

But by an unknown twist of fate, during her field of work, Guinevere stumbles across a mound-like tomb that channels the celestial abilities of the mythical god, Atlas.  During thorough research, Guinevere discovers that dark evil deities from multi dimensions, often in the disguise of humans, have been trying to gain possession of Atlas' powers for ages in an attempt to destroy the universe based off their ultimate evil plans.


After further research, Guinevere discovers that there was no coincidence of her discovery of Atlas' tomb and that she is celestially linked to the powers, giving her a right to posses them, manifesting extra abilities such as time traveling, unnatural strength, astral projection and many more.
 
Realizing the universes are in danger by the deities she harness the powers and takes on the mantle of balancer for both the celestial and terrestrial plains, becoming her alter ego ""SALTA.""  Spell the name backwards...  ;-) 
 
Why the revamp of female superheroines?
I love storytelling and happen to be a great fanatic of characterization.  Throughout the years I've been waiting anxiously for more strong female heroines.  They're a few in other comic universes that has influenced the thought, but not as many as I would like to see.   
I will like to add to the entourage with a strong character of my own.  With this approach, I would like to contribute more to the famous quote, ""Story First.""     
 
How will the money be used?
Please help us raise $6,500 to cover the cost of artwork for my creative team.  This include penciling, inking, coloring, lettering, etc.  It will also go toward printing and shipping copies of the comic & rewards to all donors. 
Even if we don't reach our goal, all donors are still guaranteed to get as your reward.  But let's take it to further heights and reach the goal!  :-) 
 
The common question:
For months I've been flooded with the common question,  ""will you make this comic a motion picture one day??.""   I've tried keeping answers at bay to focus mainly on developing the comic but realize that people know that I am a filmmaker and would like to see the story on screen. 
So to prevent anymore grey hairs the answer is YES!!!  But first thing's first, people need to know the story as a comic!!
I need your help to fund this project so the story of SALTA is on the market. I am beyond excited about the first issue and can't wait to get the story in your hands! :-)
P.S.  Enjoy the promo in the gallery section!  This is just a taste of what's to come!!

<h3>*UPDATE* As a result of our offline funding efforts for this book, if we can reach $4000 on Indiegogo, we will have enough to print the book in colour the way we want! We're almost there!<br/>
</h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are the Cloudscape Comics Society, a non-profit organisation dedicated to supporting British Columbia based comic artists and their community. We run weekly gatherings, events, and fundraisers. We offer our 60 members access to a local distribution network, information about and access to printers and other services to support their independent comic endeavours.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our annual project is to produce an anthology that will highlight some of the best short story work by members of our group. Our latest anthology is 21 Journeys, although the title is subject to change depending on if we can get all our member's work in on time :)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are asking for help in printing 21 Journeys because it is a 250 page full colour book, an ambitious project that has expanded beyond our current capacity. Every contribution of $25 or more is a pre-order, and you will receive a copy of 21 Journeys along with other goodies. We have outlined the different incentive scales below.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We will be able to publish and support more than 22 artists and writers directly contributing to the book. Contributors get copies of the anthology at wholesale, giving them an opportunity to flesh out their inventory and have more books to sell to comic stores, at conventions and on their online stores. Their contribution will also allow them a publishing credit, a crucial necessity to apply for Literary Grants from the Government of Canada and British Columbia.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we do not reach our fundraising goal, the hard work done by each of the contributors over the last 6 months will be sorely wasted. Our organisation is lucky to have some very talented and dedicated artist and we want to see them flourish!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $7000 that will directly go towards printing 1,000 copies of the book. This is the minimum to print offset, which makes our per unit price competitive and viable for distribution to bookstores and comic shops. If, by some miracle, we reach $8,500, we will be able to print 2,000 copies, doubling our selling power with only $1500 more.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Punchline is an ongoing comic book and trade paperback series published by Antarctic Press. Our series is available at many comic book shops through Diamond Comics Distribution. A version of our first issue was offered on Free Comic Book Day in 2019.</p>

<p>In Super-Frenemies, Jessie meets other people that live a super-double life much like hers. She learns the source of her new powers as she makes new friends and enemies. Super-Frenemies collects Punchline #6- #10. Antarctic Press is publishing a version of this trade and if your store carries our book, shop with them. For the people not near a comic book store, this might be your best opportunity to read our comic.</p>
<p>The campaign for Punchline: Super-Frenemies will raise funds to help pay the printing bill for the second collection and to get ahead of the expenses on the next batch of issues. </p>
<p>We are shipping signed hard covers and signed trade paperback editions of the second collection, Super-Frenemies. This edition will have a cover gallery and sketch book material not included in the Antarctic Press version of the collection. Our version of the book will have a final page count of over 130 pages.</p>

<p><span>Walking on Broken Glass is an urban fantasy with a sense of humor, about a man (who happens to be a werewolf) with terrible prophetic dreams about losing his morality and doing unspeakable things to the people he loves. Understandably, this isn’t at all what he wants, so he strives every day to make up for his future wrongs. Meanwhile, he has a terrible crush on his gun-toting fashionista secretary and best friend, who is bent on changing his fate altogether.</span></p>
<div>Meanwhile, monsters are attacking their city, in sneaky and clandestine ways. He and his pack are looking to figure out why they’re here, where they come from, and most of all, how to stop them. It’s about monsters. It’s about magic. It’s about werewolves! And witches! And vampires! (Oh my?)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<span>In issue 5, faced with a relationship that's grown closer than she was expecting, Kennedy is faced with sharing her deepest kept secret with the man she loves. Remembering how she came to know all his secrets only reinforces a sense of guilt over her own innate suspicion and dread at Nick's reaction to the one piece of herself she could never share with him before. </span>

<p>We're aiming to print 200 copies of volume 1 and 150 copies of issue 5. Should we go above and beyond our goal of $3150, the extra funds will go back into the company for printing more comics, and promoting Broken Glass. </p>

<h3>Who am I and what is this?</h3>
<p>Hello. My name is Tinet. I've drawn since I could hold a pencil, and since I was little I've made up characters and stories to escape my messed up reality. At 15 I decided I wanted to learn to draw comics for real, and I started to draw ""Driftwood"". 16 years and 387 pages later, here I am, and here it is.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kommiekomiks.com/indiegogo/9-46.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Driftwood is an epic anarcho-socialist adventure story about parallel universes inhabited by pirates, assassins, love-girls, cossacks, revolutionaries and shamans, and romantic harbour towns in foreign lands that may remind of Communist China and the Soviet Union.<br/>It's a love story. And it's a story about being a second generation immigrant, working class and the child of an alcoholic.<br/>Not least is it a story about growing up. </p>
<p>The life of 16 year old Willie is dominated by her dad's alcoholism and the mystery with her mother, who was absent all of Willie's life, but has now contacted her again out of the blue and wants to meet her.<br/>Willie's mum arranges a ferry trip for her to come visit her in Norway, but the ferry sinks in the North Sea. Willie is able to save herself on a life raft, and mysterious things start to happen ... She finds herself in a different world, and is rescued by the crew of the sailing ship the<em> Eagle Ray</em>. They drag her along on their crazy adventures, and in the process Willie starts to learn to deal with her problems at home and to dare to choose her own way in her life.</p>
<p>You can <a href=""http://kommiekomiks.com/driftwood/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">read Driftwood online here</a> to see if you like it. (Though for the printed edition I've redone the lettering and translation of the earlier chapters.)</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kommiekomiks.com/indiegogo/8-38.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Now that <strong>Driftwood</strong> is finished, I'm printing it as a book. It was published in Swedish last year. But <a href=""http://doggie-island.tumblr.com/post/55412812823/why-the-english-edition-of-driftwood-will-be-better"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the English edition is even better</a>. Heh.</p>
<p>Driftwood will be 392 pages, black and white, 17x22 cm.</p>
<p><img alt=""Flotsam cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kommiekomiks.com/indiegogo/Flotsam-cover-s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I've also put together the book<strong> Flotsam and Jetsam</strong>, with all the side stories, lots of sketches and illustrations from all the 17 years I've been working on Driftwood, and deleted scenes. There are also articles about what influenced me to create the story and the characters, and notes about interesting details such as Eva's mysterious breast expansion between chapters 6 and 7, or how telepathic powers aren't really a supernatural thing in my experience. </p>
<p>Flotsam and Jetsam will be 204 pages, black and white, 17x22 cm.</p>
<p>Anyways,<strong> the actual cost of printing the two books is 2220 €</strong>.

But who cares about that when you can print comics!! <br/>However, you can help me with the funds by pre-ordering here.</p>
<p>And more importantly, the number of copies I've planned is limited:<br/>300 copies of ""Driftwood"" and 100 copies of ""Flotsam and Jetsam"". So to make sure you get one, you should really pre-order. <br/>And in case hundreds of people should happen to pre-order copies, I can print more books and actually be able to afford it! Win-win!</p>
<p>You can also get both books as digital copies in PDF format. Handy if you don't like to be burdened by too many worldly possessions and don't mind reading books on your computer, or if you're not <em>quite</em> sure if you like it enough to get a printed copy. </p>
<p>I'm also making <strong>T-shirts</strong> that will look like this:</p>
<p><img alt='The ""No Leashes, No Masters"" T-shirt' class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kommiekomiks.com/indiegogo/shirt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>""No leashes, no masters"" ... I'll post actual photos after I get the test shirts. They'll be printed with Spreadshirt (guaranteed no American Apparel), and available in women's fitted sizes, women's plus sizes, and men's sizes. You can write your preferred size and cut as a note in paypal, or I will contact you about it when it's time to order the shirts.</p>
<p>You also have<strong> the exclusive chance to acquire an original page</strong> of your choice. I drew it on A3 sized paper. Some of the originals look terrible (adds to the charm, I guess). So I offer you both the actual original and a print if you'd like. First come, first serve ...</p>

</div></div>","Who am I and what is this?
Hello. My name is Tinet. I've drawn since I could hold a pencil, and since I was little I've made up characters and stories to escape my messed up reality. At 15 I decided I wanted to learn to draw comics for real, and I started to draw ""Driftwood"". 16 years and 387 pages later, here I am, and here it is.

Driftwood is an epic anarcho-socialist adventure story about parallel universes inhabited by pirates, assassins, love-girls, cossacks, revolutionaries and shamans, and romantic harbour towns in foreign lands that may remind of Communist China and the Soviet Union.It's a love story. And it's a story about being a second generation immigrant, working class and the child of an alcoholic.Not least is it a story about growing up. 
The life of 16 year old Willie is dominated by her dad's alcoholism and the mystery with her mother, who was absent all of Willie's life, but has now contacted her again out of the blue and wants to meet her.Willie's mum arranges a ferry trip for her to come visit her in Norway, but the ferry sinks in the North Sea. Willie is able to save herself on a life raft, and mysterious things start to happen ... She finds herself in a different world, and is rescued by the crew of the sailing ship the Eagle Ray. They drag her along on their crazy adventures, and in the process Willie starts to learn to deal with her problems at home and to dare to choose her own way in her life.
You can read Driftwood online here to see if you like it. (Though for the printed edition I've redone the lettering and translation of the earlier chapters.)

Driftwood is my pet project, but I think it may also be quite valuable for other people. I would have been so happy to discover a comic like this when I was younger (and certainly also now that I'm a bit older).
It's a comic by and for girls, with complex and flawed female characters who deal with women's problems. (It's a bit sad that this is still a relatively unusual thing ...)And other children of alcoholics have told me that it was a good comic to read, as it deals with these issues in a constructive way that you don't see very often.
And of course, even if you can't directly identify with those aspects, it's an interesting story with plenty of drama, romance and stupid/dark humour! 



Books!

Now that Driftwood is finished, I'm printing it as a book. It was published in Swedish last year. But the English edition is even better. Heh.
Driftwood will be 392 pages, black and white, 17x22 cm.

I've also put together the book Flotsam and Jetsam, with all the side stories, lots of sketches and illustrations from all the 17 years I've been working on Driftwood, and deleted scenes. There are also articles about what influenced me to create the story and the characters, and notes about interesting details such as Eva's mysterious breast expansion between chapters 6 and 7, or how telepathic powers aren't really a supernatural thing in my experience. 
Flotsam and Jetsam will be 204 pages, black and white, 17x22 cm.
Anyways, the actual cost of printing the two books is 2220 €. I have some money put away ... although I put it away in order to cover for medical and other emergencies if such should ever happen to me. But who cares about that when you can print comics!! However, you can help me with the funds by pre-ordering here.

I grew up like many enjoying the major comic companies and characters they produce.  As i grew as an artist, I began attempting to submit work to the major three in hopes of getting to work my dream job as an illustrator on these characters.  But the more I worked, the more I realized maybe that wasn't exactly the path.  I began working as a freelancer, things have had their ups and downs, but I have continue to work on various projects and grow my own style.  Overtime I began to dream more about my own projects and the idea of bringing them to life. I also realized as I did comic conventions that many people spoke of things that the industry lacked. Stories they wanted, and characters that could bring a lost energy back to comics.  That's where Legends of the Black Pandas comes in.  I am not saying this fixes all missing gaps, but i am saying that it fills in a few.  This isn't the type of project that would get published by the majors, but it is a project you can proudly stand behind and watch grow and be a part of with the person who actually created it!<br/></p>
<p>I have respect for the other companies, but part of the beauty of crowd funding is freedom and options.  Black Pandas is a chance to bring something a little familiar, yet different back to the forefront in comics. The classic Protagonist who must avenge his, well ...everything.... So here is the story....<br/></p>
<p><b><b>Pandas, Giant beast, Samurai, Ninjas, and martial arts!!</b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Synopsis:</b></p>
<p><b>Legend of the Black Pandas: ""A world once existed that was balanced and at peace. Ruled by the Lion King Panda, all in his Kingdom enjoyed a peaceful and balanced world.... Until the legend was delivered that two sons would be born unto two kings, the last of the legendary Black Panda bloodline. These sons would decide the fate of all in this land. The first born would have first choice in his path. This choice would either continue balance or disrupt it. Ursus was born first, two hundred years before the son of the Lion King Panda, and raised under the hand of a fallen king who cared only for the wealthy and sought to rid the land of those deemed ""unworthy"". With this upbringing, Ursus grew to be the hand of destruction and forge forward taking over the Six Kingdoms of Equality. Jai-Den, born two hundred years later, is hidden by monks after the fall of his mighty fathers kingdom. The monks raise him, the last pure blooded of his kind, teaching him the martial arts, magic, understanding of chi energies, and compassion. All an attempt to prepare him for the day when he will have to rise to reclaim the land for the people to restore balance and defeat Ursus. This is the story of where the Legend of the Black Pandas begins.""</b><br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What I am asking for. <br/>
</h3>
<p>My total goal for this project is $3,000.00. These funds would be used to cover production cost for the project. I am not depending only on this fund raiser to produce the book. I am printing copies of issue 1 out my own pocket to take to conventions, use to promote the project, and continue to produce future issues.  So if the total goal isn't reached, though i hope it is, any funds raised will go towards satisfying perks selected, covering cost for books, posters, bookmarks, and fees to run the campaign that go to Indiegogo and pay pal. Meeting the goal would allow me to produce at least 200 copies each (1,000 total) of the first 5 issues of the series, 11x17 prints, a collected volume 1 soft cover of the first five issues with some extras inside, stickers, bookmarks, and possibly a few other cool extras.  The money raised isn't to pay me for the artwork or cover cost for conventions i attend, but instead to produce the product and help me bring everything to life in the best quality and secure the path to making this project grow. </p>

<br/><h3>The Importance of your support.</h3>The core of any successful project is often the people who support and believe in.  Your contribution is just as important as the story,the characters, the art, the final product itself. Without you reading the book, telling someone about it, or contributing to this campaign... there is no life to the project.  Your support is the most valuable thing to any project of any kind. If you don't like or support something, it doesn't grow.  I truly want to bring something strong, fun, and cool back to comics and a little different. This is a story that as it grows, you can actually give input that helps it grow, and be a part of it from the beginning.  I value you and the energy you bring to the table. Help me to make some major noise with this project, and force the major companies to pay a little attention and give more support to things other than the normal. <br/>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Jon Hughes, and you probably know me best as the founder of an independent comic book publishing imprint called <a href=""https://www.overgroundcomics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Overground Comics</a>.  If you don't, that's okay, we're pretty small.  While most of my experience in comic books is as a writer, I also enjoy drawing, and I drew quite a few covers for the Overground books  when it was necessary.  During my time as a publisher, I continued to work as a commission artist to help raise money for my comic books, and the result is a lengthy portfolio of sketch covers, a popular collectible in the comic book community.  I've decided to collect my best works into a book in order to, you guessed it, raise some money for my further comic book projects.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise funds for an upcoming project, and so I'm offering this new anthology with some cool perks to go along with it, namely a lot of original art.  I'm doing my best to make these works in the highest quality, to give you all incentive to take part in this.  Remember, even though I'm a writer and editor professionally, I've been drawing my whole life, and I hope to make an impact with this project.  </p>
<p><strong>Here are some images of the sketches that will appear in full size in the book!</strong></p>

</div></div>","Hey, there! My name is Andres Colmenares, I'm the creator of Wawawiwa comics, an illustration project that started in 2010 and has turned into something that I really love. My comics are inspired by daily objects, food, animals and life. I currently live with my amazing wife and son in Bogota, Colombia. 


Recently we reached 100K followers on Instagram, and we want to take this opportunity to celebrate and also ask for your help to reach a goal we've had in mind for a while. We've been running this small family business for a few years now and we would love to expand to other countries, so all of our friends can find our products easily.
 

To be able to reach our goal, we want to start distributing our products in a few stores located in United States. For this, we've estimated a production of 3500 enamel pins + sticker packs. The total amount we need is US$5514.


There are 7 different designs available. Created in zinc alloy with an average size of 40mm  (1.57 inches).


 
Each pack will contain 5 different vinyl stickers.

These stickers have great outdoor durability. Sizes will go from 1.7 inches to 2.7 inches. One sticker will have holographic details and another one will have mirror effect with metallic background color. Which ones? It's a surprise!
 

In order to buy you must select a ""perk"". Each perk has a price and contains different products and quantity.
On desktop, you’ll see a list with all available perks on the right hand side of the page. Click on the perk you want, then click the ""Get This Perk"" button to be redirected to the payment page. If you're on a mobile device, scroll up to see all available perks.
Once you select the quantity of pins you'd like and purchase. We will contact you in around 24-48 hours, via email, to ask which designs you would like to receive when we start shipping everything.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>I joined Scotland's newest daily newspaper, The National, as a freelancer in December 2014. Since then, each week without fail I've created a full-page, satirical comic strip based around whatever political situation happened to unfold. But the coronavirus lockdown has meant shops have closed and people are unable to buy newspapers. As a consequence, The National is functioning with a skeleton staff and is unable to pay freelancers.</strong></p>
<p>It strikes me that now is not the time to stop making fun of politicians, when there is such a glut of incompetence and buffoonery on display, and readers are trapped at home desperate for anything that might raise a smile. So I plan to continue cartooning, publishing the usual Monday strip on my website, gregmoodie.com, for the next three months until we see how the land lies.</p>
<p>At the end of three months, I will gather the cartoons produced and publish them in a one-off National-sized tabloid newspaper called 'The Lockdown Chronicles'.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Deal</h3>
<p>In order to do this, I need your help. What I'm asking for is a basic wage for three months and enough to cover the newspaper's production, along with sturdy packaging and postage costs. In return, you will have access to all of the cartoons online and receive a hard copy of 'The Lockdown Chronicles'. All contributors, unless they choose anonymity, will be listed in the paper.</p>
<p>Additional perks include limited edition digital prints of the 'Robert Burns in Lockdown' image and signed hand-painted screenprints of the image, each one unique. These will only be produced to order and will not be available to buy beyond this campaign.</p>

Each of the seven main characters is a warrior with unique powers.  Their strength as individual fighters and as a team grows through the series as they meet new challenges and overcome the forces that oppose them.  Their mission is to discover the ancient legend of the LadyStar and defend the Realm of Aventar from the Cryptics and their evil minions.</p>
<p>Girls can be heroes, and in the world of LadyStar, they <i>are</i> the heroes. Our stories are different from many others in television, books and movies where the teenage girl characters are often sour, hyper-competitive, angry, jealous and self-destructive.  The challenges faced by Jessica and her friends reaffirm the value of teamwork, courage and friendship.  As warriors, they rely on their honor to sustain them through hardship and crisis.</p>

Tomorrow's Update #7: The Warrior of the Rocks



LadyStar: Fury of the Venom Legion is a full-color comic series based on W. Scott's LadyStar characters.  It tells the story of Jessica Hoshi's Ajan Warriors and the Scribe Arcanist Reina of Kulnas joining forces to defeat the Cryptic Sorcerer Sai Magnen and his legion of fiends in the isolated and treacherous Chaer Badlands.
The first volume in the Venom Legion series LadyStar: Fury of the Venom Legion #1 is currently the top-rated LadyStar book with an average 4.7-star rating, and on October 16, 2013 was ranked the #7 superhero book on Amazon.com.
LadyStar is a fantasy adventure book series about seven girls who wear magical jewelry that can become powerful weapons.  Each of the seven main characters is a warrior with unique powers.  Their strength as individual fighters and as a team grows through the series as they meet new challenges and overcome the forces that oppose them.  Their mission is to discover the ancient legend of the LadyStar and defend the Realm of Aventar from the Cryptics and their evil minions.
Girls can be heroes, and in the world of LadyStar, they are the heroes. Our stories are different from many others in television, books and movies where the teenage girl characters are often sour, hyper-competitive, angry, jealous and self-destructive.  The challenges faced by Jessica and her friends reaffirm the value of teamwork, courage and friendship.  As warriors, they rely on their honor to sustain them through hardship and crisis.
LadyStar has been in continuous development for 13 years, and is now featured in a series of 21 novels, novellas and comics on the Kindle e-book platform.  This campaign is to fund development of the second issue of the Fury of the Venom Legion comic series.
We are a team of 17 artists, eight voice actors and two writers.  We have developed 33 interactive games, including a record-setting hit release on the Steam PC Game Store, 21 e-books including six full-color comic titles, eight audiocasts and a daily animated video series.  We have produced, on average, a new commercial product every six weeks for the last five-and-a-half years.
LadyStar is our first commercial project, and our flagship series.
Five years ago, we published the comic that helped launch our business.  That comic was LadyStar: Fury of the Venom Legion Issue #1. It began a series that brought us over 200,000 new readers and helped us build the largest English-language webcomic association in the world with over 115 member sites and 70,000 readers a day.
Now, the same team that brought you LadyStar: Fury of the Venom Legion is preparing Issue #2.  We believe we can top our opening act and we want you to be a part of it!
Bug - Art Director - Bug is one of our studio's most veteran artists.  She was the page designer and lead artist on all six of our comic titles, and her work has been featured in dozens of studio projects, from games to official merchandise to animation.
Bug's specialty is epic character design, and she is equally conversant with both western and anime comic styles.  One of her primary talents is dramatic page design, and our newest comic is certain to benefit from her creativity.  She is the artist and creator of the long-running Tales of Pylea webcomic series.
Animetor - Animation Director - Animetor brings a unique style to Heavy Cat Studios' works.  Her skill in hand-drawn linear animation has been the foundation of many successful projects beginning with some of our earliest games and leading right through to our new animated web series.
Her comic work both in her own projects and the studio's have been dramatic successes.  Her character design, page design and color style have been crucial to sales and critical acclaim for the LadyStar comic series, and her book covers have become the stuff of studio legend.  She is the artist and creator of the Magician's Quest webcomic.
Hortensie - Lead Environments Artist - If we need a place for something magical or mysterious to happen, Hortensie will probably draw it for us.  An expert in the arcane art of speedpainting, Hortensie is renowned for her ability to make you look twice at her work to be sure you aren't looking at a photograph.
She will be primarily responsible for mattes, backgrounds and color design in the new comic.  Expect something stunning, because all of her studio work so far has been nothing short of ""wow"" level.
The Crow - Lead Creature Design - If there were an awards category for ""nightmare fuel,"" The Crow would need to build new shelves on a regular basis for his trophies. One of our fastest and most prolific artists, The Crow is capable of combining realistic texture and otherworldly design into illustrations that are in a word ""unforgettable.""
(His plans for Sai Magnen's ""alternate forms"" are more than a little unsettling, so prepare yourself before you recklessly dive into this particular comic.)
You might think that girl warriors would face something not-quite-as-scary as other warriors might expect, and you would be wrong.  The Crow will see to it that the Ajan Warriors have all manner of beasties to contend with as they journey through the action-packed pages of this comic project.
Chibi - Lead Producer - All great teams need a leader, and Chibi is our most accomplished producer.  She has led dozens of projects for our studio, both large and small, and her managerial instincts have been honed to a precise and superior level over the past two years.
Chibi's skills range from color style to inking to original illustration work.  She has an appealing style and a huge library of work to draw inspiration from.  Chibi is a skilled creative professional and we are looking forward to her contributions during production of our comic project.
W. Scott - Author and Script Writer - W. Scott is the creator of LadyStar and the author of 11 books and four comic titles in the Adventures of Jessica Hoshi series.
Scott is a 17-year veteran of the entertainment industry whose work includes script and character development for comics, games, audiocasts, animation and numerous other book series, including The Zombie Plumbers, Railgranny and Fat Guys on Tricycles with Bazookas
Scott's newest free work is featured at the new LadyStar: The Ajan Champions site.
We're going to write, draw and color a new comic book of either 22, 30 or 40 pages to continue the story of LadyStar: Fury of the Venom Legion where Issue #1 left off in 2008.
And YOU can be a part of this project!  By contributing to our campaign, you are making this comic happen, and in return, we're giving you some of the coolest rewards any comic project has ever made available!

<h3>The Unforgotten</h3>
<p>Who is William Messner-Loebs? <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Messner-Loebs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(Click to find out--he's amazing!)</a></p>
<p>William and Nadine Messner-Loebs are wonderful people, and we remember not only the great work they have done within the comic book community but also the types of inspiration, encouragement, and direct help in getting us on our own creative paths.  Were it not for them, I would have lost hope in terms of my own personal desire to create comics and games.  It was for this reason that I asked my friends in Detroit Tradecraft to not only create art and story for this anthology, but also to put out the word in our community that we wanted to help Bill and Nadine. </p>
<p>This full-color comic book is thirty-six pages of art and story, featuring many of those in our community.  In order of appearance, these are:</p>

<li>Anthony Zicari and Claudio Sepulveda, and</li>
<li>Nick Gibson, Jason Johnson, and Jammie Eric Baird</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>I mostly handled editing and a few lettering assists.  All profits from sales of these books (after manufacture and shipping, as necessary) will go directly to Bill and Nadine.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The goal we set assumes the cost of a print run of 500 books and shipments for the books within the United States, with the profit going directly to Bill and Nadine Messner-Loebs.   The more books we print, however, the lower the cost-per-book goes, and the more we get to give.  Should we miraculously raise enough to help them into a new home by our means alone, any surplus funds will go to Habitat for Humanity, helping to build homes for the homeless.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>What you get depends on your level of donation to the cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3:  A digital version of The Unforgotten</li>
<li>$10:  A print copy of The Unforgotten, shipped anywhere in the United States by US First Class service</li>

<h3>If We Miss Our Goal</h3>
<p>If we miss our, everyone still gets their books--we're committed to that.  It just means we don't end up sending nearly as much to Bill and Nadine.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the end, this isn't about us.  This is about William and Nadine Messner-Loebs and helping them find their way back into a place of their own.  This is also about homelessness in general--these are people like us, and most of us are just one bad month from being on the streets, just like them.  This anthology highlights that fact.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge was getting the content together.  I was hoping to get everything together by mid-September (and then later, by mid-October) so that we could hopefully have something for Bill and Nadine in time for Christmas.  Sadly, stories ran past deadline, so we had to start the campaign late.  That said, even with the late timing, every bit of this helps.  The only problem that could be bigger would only be if this proves a bigger success than I could have hoped, which may force a change in layout to accommodate a larger ""thank you"" page or take up more of my own time in getting these shipped out.  To my mind, this would be a great problem to have.  Still, this isn't my first time making an anthology (or handling mass shipping).  If that happens, I look forward to it.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>SHORT SUMMARY</p>
<p>Sarah-Isabelle Tremblay: Creator, illustrator, co-writer</p>
<p>Kendra Henderson: Co-creator and writer</p> <p>We are long-term friends, pursuing different paths, who joined forces to create something together. Sarah is interested in visual narrative and wordless storytelling. Kendra is interested in the power of fiction in meaning making. Together, we want to explore the power of the comic medium. We take inspiration from science fiction, gothic and horror, as well as fairytales.</p>
<p><strong>Our story is about how communication technology affects fundamental human experiences such as loss, love and loyalty</strong>. We also aim to look at the increasing role of a.i. technology in our lives and relationships.</p>
<p>It is science fiction as much as it is science fact; social media and our online lives are in the process of shifting our framework for grief and loneliness.  How do we deal with the loss of someone we love when their online presence continues in our lives?</p>
<p>Comic books and graphic novels are well suited to literature of trauma and survivorship.With our project, we hope to open up discussion about the relationship between technology and grief, and, more broadly, the interplay between verbal and visual.</p>

</div></div>","SHORT SUMMARY
Sarah-Isabelle Tremblay: Creator, illustrator, co-writer
Kendra Henderson: Co-creator and writer We are long-term friends, pursuing different paths, who joined forces to create something together. Sarah is interested in visual narrative and wordless storytelling. Kendra is interested in the power of fiction in meaning making. Together, we want to explore the power of the comic medium. We take inspiration from science fiction, gothic and horror, as well as fairytales.
Our story is about how communication technology affects fundamental human experiences such as loss, love and loyalty. We also aim to look at the increasing role of a.i. technology in our lives and relationships.
It is science fiction as much as it is science fact; social media and our online lives are in the process of shifting our framework for grief and loneliness.  How do we deal with the loss of someone we love when their online presence continues in our lives?
Comic books and graphic novels are well suited to literature of trauma and survivorship.With our project, we hope to open up discussion about the relationship between technology and grief, and, more broadly, the interplay between verbal and visual.
The story is written, the pages have been drawn, and now we need your help with the final stages: coloring, printing and distribution.  You can make our dream a reality by helping with production costs! WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET Sarah here, this is the breakdown of where the money goes: ~1,500$ _gets us 300 copies of the book
~150$ _goes to colouring materials for the final stages of the book
~1000$ _for everything to go with distribution. This consists of the shipping costs of books to a few different cities, as well as transportation to attend a book launch (or two?) in other cities.
~200$ _is for printing merchandise and promotional material.
~150$ _well, this is just a buffer fund in case of potential unforeseeable problems! If there is no urgent need for this extra money, it will go directly perks or my next comic project :) PERKS
Please check out the perks on the side, there are options of receiving prints of my art for your contributions, as well as physical and digital copies of the book. I am so happy to send you my art for you to enjoy, this is what I live for! IMPACT Increasingly, our lives and experiences are captured, logged, and codified online.  Our online lives can be tailored and edited to create the version of ourselves we wish to present to the world.

<h3>Synopsis </h3>
<p>T.I.T.S. is an ongoing comic book series chronicling the adventures of a cosmic cabbie named Blotter, his feline navigator Skitz Skatz, and a disgruntled Seattle PD detective named Starla.  Blotter and Skitz Skatz work for a taxi company called T.I.T.S. that specializes in transporting aliens and other cosmic beings throughout the multiverse.  These travelers are known as Transmigrants.  Blotter and Skitz Skatz come to Earth seeking out a Transmigrant.  However, due to equipment malfunctions, getting into trouble, and being bad at their jobs, the duo wind up botching their mission as they roam the streets of Seattle creating havoc.  Before long they draw the attention of Starla, who unwittingly gets sucked into their chaotic world.  Unbeknownst to this caustic trio, their actions will determine the fate of the entire multiverse!  And if Primordious and his fiendish android Icivious have anything to do with it, that fate will be dire indeed!  What ensues is a hilarious, mind-bending romp that questions the very nature of reality as we know it!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mystery House Comics is a small-press publisher in Boise, Idaho.  Our mission is to bring the tools of self-publishing to potential comics creators and encourage writers and artists to take the first steps in making comics. <i> 6x6</i> is a great opportunity to give feedback and advice on scripting and layout, to show creators step-by-step how to print and self-publish, and to practice salesmanship and table etiquette at conventions.  MHC also cares about expanding and fostering our local comics community.  The creative teams in each volume have never worked together before and learn to work with someone new while creating a new connection and making a new friend in the community they can count on for advice, recommendations, and future projects. <i> 6x6</i> is a fun and adventurous project that utilizes the skill and experience of established, published creators, as well as providing a first opportunity for brand new writers and artists.  <i>6x6:FORTUNE</i> is guided by editors Mike Dreher (2-time <i>6x6</i> contributor and artist of <i>CAT 5</i>), Elysium Jacks (writer and 2-time <i>6x6</i> contributor), Jon Keithley (writer of <i>Shivertown</i> and Editor-in-Chief of Mystery House Comics), and Shanae Lavelle (artist of <i>Shivertown </i>and Art Director of Mystery House Comics).""</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Mystery House Comics will print 200 copies of the comic book to be sold at conventions, events, and in retail locations like Captain Comics of Boise.  Creators are rewarded for their involvement with 10 complimentary issues.  Print costs total around $600 for those 320 copies, plus $244 for variant covers.  We will be throwing the creators a RELEASE PARTY in October to promote the book, and to thank and reward them for their time and effort.  The event will feature a multimedia reading of each comic with professional actors and a chance to chat with all 12 artists and writers, get their signature, and pick their brains about their work and the experience.  The only costs to the event are venue ($400) and refreshments ($150).  We will be holding the event at the El Korah Shriners Hall.  It's a great space and all of the venue fees go to their children's hospital.  It means a lot to dedicate an evening to these talented comic book creators.  Please help us make them feel like the VIPs they are for an evening.</p>
<p>Rewards for contributing to the creation of this comic include: a signed copy of <i>6x6:FORTUNE</i>, 3 limited edition variant covers, original art by the creators involved, and a seat at the VIP table at our October release party!</p>
<p>In the event we don't reach our goal, what we raise will be put towards printing first and foremost.  This book is an important opportunity for creators of all experience levels to learn and grow, and we think it's one of the projects that really makes our flourishing Idaho comic book scene special.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>6x6</i> began in 2014 with our first volume, FERAL, co-published by Corvid Tear Media.  That edition featured work by Erica Crockett, author of <i>Chemicals</i> and <i>The Blood Zodiac </i>series, Albert Asker, Editor-in-Chief of Idaho Comics Group and publisher of <i>Tarzan and the Comics of Idaho,</i> Tarey Potter, whose art makes a return in this year's edition, and included editorial work by Crockett and Joshua Shapel, co-founder of the Boise Library Comic Con.</p>
<p>The anthology was successful enough it returned in 2015 with <i>MOMENTUM</i> featuring Rob Liefeld-protege Jacob Bear, current <i>6x6</i> editors Mike Dreher and Elysium Jacks, and Bop Comics founder Randall Kirby.  Every year we're able to improve the process for the creators and to expand our reach and resources one aspect at a time.  In 2016 we were our most ambitious to date with the release of <i>6x6:PRETEND</i>.  The book featured an incredible roster of writers and artists including Jacob Bear, Joseph Bradshaw, Mike Dreher, Dan Feldmeier, Elysium Jacks, Steve Willhite, and we pulled off the biggest release party yet with a live band and a slideshow timing each comic, panel-by-panel, to music and live performances by professional actors.  </p>
<p>This year we've been able to make additions to the process we've always wanted.  In addition to a Meet and Greet for creators to get to know one another, we're hosting a Script Workshop and a Layout Workshop for writers and artists to sit down with their editors and work through the creative process face-to-face, overcoming obstacles and clarifying communication to ensure the finished product is more collaborative and detailed than ever before.</p>
<p><i>6x6</i> is an important part of the Treasure Valley comic book creative culture.  It welcomes new artists and writers and introduces them to the creative partners who can help them make their dreams a reality.  It gives potential creators a chance to take their first drag in the art of making comics, and hopefully they come away addicted and eager for more.  When it's time for their next project they now know two handfuls of artists and writers to lean on for help, advice, and even partnership.  This project is a great chance to get experienced comic book creators who have their own lessons to impart in the room with people who may be able to benefit from their knowledge, and the old dogs can definitely learn a thing or two from new talent with a fresh perspective.  </p>
<h3>Other Ways you Can Help!</h3>
</div><p>We realize you have a lot of options when it comes to crowdfunding campaigns.  And comic books.  And crowdfunding campaigns to support comic books.  If you can't help out right now... no worries.  But what you CAN DO is tell everyone you know about this campaign.  This is a passion project for everyone involved and it would mean the world to us if you would TELL YOUR FRIENDS!  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram... greeting cards...

Its something that I never thought people would get the chance to see, but here we are! </p><p> In the tech-heavy city of Bettano, crime is at an all time high. Blood is being stolen and sold on the black market and authorities are powerless to stop it. Some are not too subtle about how they get it either. Two men rise to the forefront. The Rival...the man who has sworn to protect this city and make it safe for the girl he loves. The other...the Tingod, the fearless overlord who has no regard for society and their rules. Their lives will forever intertwine from this point on. And there is Sadie Thomas, the girl who loves the Rival. She begins to play a part in both of their lives. A part she never would've imagined. Rivals all. It begins what will become a psychological journey for all. This book will be the first in a long line of RIVAL books set to go forward.</p><p>Rival was a series I did many years ago, and was set very far in the characters life. There was never an origin issue for it. Never a beginning that I was able to share. Finally, we put together RIVAL gold and silver. It wasn't until recently that all production parts and pieces were returned that we were able to complete this edition and finally show the world this hidden gem done by some of the legends of the business. There are 4 stories in this volume, and you'll get know the world of Bettano through each one. This issue is where everything starts for the Rival. I'm very fortunate to have worked with the artists presented here. I'm grateful to have the chance to do right by them. Dare I say it, this issue is a very historic one, not just for Rival, but for comics in general. Its a redemption story, in and out of the book.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564560218/ihadytmxwaeohml3aea7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Dick Ayers does the full length story here.

Marvel really shudda had him drawing in his later years, and I think part of him wanted to prove he still had it in this one. He definitely did.

Questo però non lo ferma dal voler scoprire di più su di sé e sul come utilizzare il suo potenziale, ma per quanto insista, Anima continua a rifiutarsi di istruirlo. Tutto questo cambierà quando Kim, invogliata da Rama, obbligherà Anima a partecipare ad un torneo di cacciatori che si tiene una volta ogni 7 anni: il torneo Gilgamesh! Ovviamente Marco si unirà all'avventura, scoprendo cosa sia la vita in un mondo al di fuori di Systema ed entrando in contatto con l'arte della Magia. Per quanto tutto sia incredibilmente nuovo e bello non bisogna mai abbassare la guardia: vecchi e nuovi nemici si nascondono nell'ombra...! I personaggi MARCO“...Meh.” -cit.Dopo aver abbandonato l’università, Marco lavora come commesso al Suppa Market e conduce una vita noiosa e ripetitiva. É goffo ed impacciato e molto spesso finisce in situazioni imbarazzanti, dalle quali esce sempre con l’amaro in bocca. Da qualche anno la sua personalità ha preso una brutta piega, trasformandolo in una persona apatica e cinica. Qualcosa nell’ombra lo sta lentamente divorando, ma cosa? ANIMA“Voi umani siete tutti uguali, di continuo a lamentarvi senza fare nulla aspettando un qualcosa che vi salvi e vi sollevi dalle vostre sofferenze. Quando verrà il giorno in cui vi prenderete le vostre maledette responsabilità?” -cit.Cacciatrice di Demoni caotica e imprevedibile. Anima porta distruzione, disinteressandosi delle conseguenze sugli esseri umani che, anzi, disprezza. A differenza dei suoi colleghi, non mira a distruggere i Demoni, bensì ad ammansirli e farli passare dalla sua parte, garantendole potere e protezione. È impulsiva ed infantile e sebbene le sue doti siano molte, è assolutamente negata a relazionarsi con il prossimo. HORMON“Non c’è abbastanza zucchero!” -cit.Dal carattere altezzoso e dispotico, Hormon è una Musa, Demone che vive a stretto contatto con gli esseri umani e che ha sviluppato una personalità ed un ego propri. Trae forza dall’energia che scaturisce dalle persone in preda a forti emozioni e dai quintali di zucchero che ingerisce ogni giorno (preferibilmente sotto forma di marshmellow); è in grado di intervenire sugli stati emotivi altrui dando un improvviso senso di benessere seguito da un boost di energia. Si diverte a giocare con le emozioni delle persone, in particolare stimolandone la libido, dalle quali trae poi nutrimento. Sebbene il suo aspetto sia carino e coccoloso e inciti allo spupazzamento, vi conviene non allungare troppo le mani: morde. RAMA“Dov’è il divertimento se non c’è sfida?” cit.Considerato un genio, Rama è un cacciatore di Demoni dalla bravura eccezionale, ma dal carattere impossibile. Accetta solo incarichi se interessanti e/o se pagato profumatamente, non si fa problemi ad abbandonare una missione se la ritiene sotto ai suoi standard di “sfida” e non ha alcun rispetto per le persone che non siano per lui fonte di divertimento.  Seppure i suoi fan (e le sue amanti) siano numerosi, conduce una vita solitaria accompagnato da Hāthī, un pupazzo automa che lui stesso ha creato e che gli funge da segretaria personale. Questa, oltre ad organizzare l’agenda e gestire i contatti, tiene conto di tutte le uscite videoludiche nel periodo lavorativo di Rama, le quali quest’ultimo recupererà richiudendosi in casa per mesi, giocando fino al completismo più estremo. MAMAN“AHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!” -citMaman è una guaritrice molto famosa e con una lista d’attesa quasi interminabile. Con le sue terapie ha salvato non poche vite, tra cui quelle di personaggi famosi e potenti. Sempre positiva, il suo motto è “la guarigione inizia sempre con una sana risata” e la sua, in particolare, scalda gli animi più tristi. La si può considerare il sindaco del Borgo, luogo incantato e in continua trasformazione, dove vivono molti Demoni e personaggi particolari, tra cui la stessa Anima. Come quest’ultima, anche Maman ha la capacità di legare con i Demoni e uno tra questi è talmente potente da essere la base su cui poggia l’intero Borgo. MOMO & PAPILLON“Doppio High five dell’amicizia!!!” -cit.Migliori amiche da sempre, Momo e Papillon appartengono alle due famiglie rivali del Borgo: quella dei Gatti del porto e quella dei Procioni del quartiere commerciale. Momo  ha un carattere dolce e gentile, lavora come cameriera e ragazza delle consegne per il Ramen-ten della madre e quando ha tempo va ad aiutare lo zio al Sushi-ya. Papillon  ha un carattere forte e altruista, lavora al supermercato di famiglia, ma è più il tempo che perde in giro a divertirsi che quello che impegna effettivamente a lavorare. Nonostante le continue lamentele da parte dei parenti, ad entrambe piace trasformarsi in esseri umani perchè lo trovano divertente e comodo. Tutte e due sono le candidate numero uno per succedere al posto di capofamiglia: riusciranno a rappacificare le acque tra i clan? SIRIO“Cacciatori di Demoni, Streghe, Stregoni, Pirati Spaziali, ne ho abbastanza! Sempre a complicare cose che potrebbero essere semplici! Vivere una vita normale vi è così difficile?” -cit.Apparentemente scontroso, ma dal cuore d’oro, Sirio lavora presso il Sushi-ya di Sakana-san come apprendista.

<h3>What is Dekko Comics?</h3>
<p>In order to explain what this product - Dekko Reader - is, you need to first understand the story behind Dekko Comics.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542720800/yvxht3n5mzkykoszhddr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Back in 2016, we launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to help fund the production and release of the first two issues of Dekko Comics. This was a comic that turned educational information into fun and engaging comic strips, using a technique I had first discovered myself while struggling at school. By presenting the information this way I was able to enjoy my learning experience and retain the information.</p>
<p>Through this, I gained my first academic A!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542720890/fhw6xr85yumadorqttm0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I shared my story in the hope that people would see the potential in what I wanted to do. I genuinely thought it could provide much-needed support for children with learning difficulties like Dyslexia (which I have), Autism and ADHD. I also thought it could help those who had no specific needs but struggled or had become disengaged.</p>
<p>The response at the time was overwhelming with a number of people expressing how they wished something like this had existed when they were at school. Within a short time, we had surpassed our goal and with the money raised, we were able to fully fund creating and releasing the comics as well as attending some conventions to help boost our small company's image. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542721107/xbypcfpj9j2ligfibpve.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Since that first campaign, we have expanded; hiring office staff and a team of artists and releasing a comic a month. On top of this, we create commissions and do workshops and talks at schools and organisations across the UK. Now we're looking to make the next step with the release of a very special app - 'Dekko Reader'.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is Dekko Reader?</h3>
<p>Dekko Reader is the next logical step for us to take as a company and as a project and will allow us to finally expand our comics into the digital market. This, in turn, will offer us the opportunity to address the issues and points that have been raised about the limitations that there are with hard-copy comic. Features on the app will include the option to add colour overlays to the pages, increase or decrease the complexity of the speech bubbles to match the readers level and add a background colour to the speech bubbles to makes them easier to read for pupils with visual stress.  </p>
<p>All of these options are designed to make the app as accessible as possible and of course, there will be updates in the future to allow for changes, improvements and new options that we have in store or are yet to think of.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542721278/yjcax8uxscnfdeyqwrgu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>What do we need from you?</h3>
<p>Our target is £20,000 which will give us enough to fully fund the creation of the app with all of the features that we've mentioned included.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Part of the challenge we'll face is that this is our first step into the digital industry and so we'll be learning as we go. Every new venture has difficulties and we fully expect this to be true for our progression into this new method of presentation.

<p>We also have a large amount of our content already available in this format as our creative process is largely done online. This means that there should be minimal delay between the app being released and the current library of Dekko content becoming available to our users.</p>
<p>As well as the app development itself this venture will require us to increase our staff numbers as we continue to expand and create new departments in the company. This can be an intimidating prospect for a small independent business but we believe that we have the necessary systems in place to ensure that this is a smooth process with minimal disruption. In the long run, we expect this expansion to improve the Dekko process and will mean that we'll be able to have a consistent scheduled release date for our monthly subscriptions.</p>
<p>We know how important communication is in these campaigns and we are committed to ensuring that all of our backers are kept informed.

</div></div>","What is Dekko Comics?
In order to explain what this product - Dekko Reader - is, you need to first understand the story behind Dekko Comics.

Back in 2016, we launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to help fund the production and release of the first two issues of Dekko Comics. This was a comic that turned educational information into fun and engaging comic strips, using a technique I had first discovered myself while struggling at school. By presenting the information this way I was able to enjoy my learning experience and retain the information.
Through this, I gained my first academic A!

I shared my story in the hope that people would see the potential in what I wanted to do. I genuinely thought it could provide much-needed support for children with learning difficulties like Dyslexia (which I have), Autism and ADHD. I also thought it could help those who had no specific needs but struggled or had become disengaged.
The response at the time was overwhelming with a number of people expressing how they wished something like this had existed when they were at school. Within a short time, we had surpassed our goal and with the money raised, we were able to fully fund creating and releasing the comics as well as attending some conventions to help boost our small company's image. 


Since that first campaign, we have expanded; hiring office staff and a team of artists and releasing a comic a month. On top of this, we create commissions and do workshops and talks at schools and organisations across the UK. Now we're looking to make the next step with the release of a very special app - 'Dekko Reader'.

What is Dekko Reader?
Dekko Reader is the next logical step for us to take as a company and as a project and will allow us to finally expand our comics into the digital market. This, in turn, will offer us the opportunity to address the issues and points that have been raised about the limitations that there are with hard-copy comic. Features on the app will include the option to add colour overlays to the pages, increase or decrease the complexity of the speech bubbles to match the readers level and add a background colour to the speech bubbles to makes them easier to read for pupils with visual stress.  
All of these options are designed to make the app as accessible as possible and of course, there will be updates in the future to allow for changes, improvements and new options that we have in store or are yet to think of.

The app will be the best way to read your digital copies of Dekko Comics and will be free with the only cost being the purchase of the comics themselves. 
The development of this app does not mean the end of our hard copy comics as we believe that is a very valid form of reading. This is about giving our readers options on how they read our comics and to provide them with greater readability and accessibility when it comes to their experience.
All backers will receive early access to the app as well as the first four copies pre-loaded onto their account so they can start reading as soon as Dekko Reader launches, which we hope will be in late 2019.

<p>Hey there, my name is Michael Anderson and I'm bringing a new convention to the Pacific Northwest.  I've been an avid attendee at conventions here for the past fourteen years.  I've also been active in helping through staffing, volunteering, and promoting these conventions.  </p>
<p>I've been involved with everything from Sci-Fi/Fantasy conventions, to Anime conventions, to Comic convention, and even more specialized conventions.  One thing they all have in common is the community of people who go to enjoy themselves and meet others from their fandoms.</p>
<p>Here in the Northwest there is a wonderful community of people from all fandoms and what I want to bring is an end of the year convention celebrating all of these fandoms.  A pop culture conventions for people to come and have a great time in the safety of our wonderful communities.</p>
<p>Contributions will allow us in our first year to acquire more guests, have more space for fan run panels, and provide a much richer experience for everyone in attendance.  It'll also allow us to do new interesting things with the con such as pod casts and live streams for those who want to enjoy the fun but can't be there in person.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Attractions/Guests</strong></p>
<p>We will add to this list as more things are secured but confirmed for Newcon we already have a number of things:</p>

<li>A cosplay burlesque hosted by our cosplay guest of honor, Bang Bang Neko (<a href=""http://bangbangneko.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bangbangneko.deviantart.com/</a>)</li>
<li>An electronic dance featuring many local DJs</li>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>What we are hoping to reach in contributions is $3000.  We already have our hotel secure, as well as many key guests.  With help of this additional funding we will be dong the following:</p>

<li>Purchasing promotional materials such as flyers, banners, and buttons.</li>
<li>Secure more guests for the convention.</li>
<li>Be able to augment less of our space for vendors and more for fan panels, guest panels, and contests.</li>
<li>Secure better equipment such as projectors and sound equipment for our panels, dances, and more.</li>
</ul><p>We wouldn't be asking for money without giving something in return!  Even at the lowest levels of donation we will be offering badges for the con at a rate lower than what it will cost when registration goes live.  We also have perks ranging from artwork by our fabulous artists to life time memberships, even VIP perks!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The main reason that motivated me, and the others who have come onboard to support this project is simple.  We want to have a celebration for the wonderful pop culture communities that make up not just Portland, but also the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>My name is Tim Sevenhuysen. You might know me as the creator of <a href=""FiftyWordStories.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">FiftyWordStories.com</a>, the guy behind the <a href=""http://timsevenhuysen.com/year-of-stories/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Year of Stories</a> (where I post a new short story to my blog for free every Monday), or the author of the sci-fi series <a href=""http://1889.ca/losingfreight"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""><em>Losing Freight</em></a> on <a href=""1889.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">1889.ca</a> and the superhero-with-a-twist series <em><a href=""http://specialpeople.timsevenhuysen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Special People</a></em>. Maybe you've seen some of the sketch comedy I worked on with <a href=""http://loadingreadyrun.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Loading Ready Run</a> between 2008 and 2010.</p>
<p>For years, it's been my dream to be a full-time author. In late 2011 I decided to start actively pursuing that dream. <em>Special People</em> is one of the bigger projects I started up to help me achieve that goal. <em>Special People</em> is a web serial about people with unique and unusual powers and abilities. It’s superpower fiction with a fistful of twists. From a human cell phone to a man who can conjure bacon out of thin air, these are unique, interesting characters, special people with their own special problems…</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I'm Doing</h3>
<p>I'm hoping to hire an artist and a letterer to create an 8-page, full-colour <em>Special People</em> comic based on my script. The comic will tell the story of the first special person Ian Innis recruits into his fledgling criminal community, from the perspective of that first recruit. The main character will be based on the man whose photo is featured in the <em>Special People </em>site banner:</p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://specialpeople.timsevenhuysen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cropped-6227809915_19fb023f73_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I'd like to post the comic to the site at a rate of two pages per week during the month of July, 2012.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why I'm Doing It</h3>
<p>One of the hardest parts of starting up a new creative project online is building an initial audience, and comics are great for gathering in eyeballs. They're also really accessible and easy to share around. If I can get this comic made, it'll be a fantastic way to draw new people into the world of <em>Special People</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, the comic will establish a stronger visual identity for the franchise and make the ""<em>Special People</em> experience"" much more immersive and engaging.</p>
<p>On top of all that, having a<em> </em>comic on the site will pave the way for other creative projects in the <em>Special People </em>universe. I'd love to do more, longer comics, put together a series of videos with the help of my friends from <a href=""http://loadingreadyrun.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Loading Ready Run</a>, and of course keep churning out the fiction (and collecting it into novels and ebooks), but doing all of that will require both money and momentum. Seeing this comic successfully funded would definitely kickstart the rest of these projects!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why You Should Get Involved: The Perks</h3>
<p>What would a crowdfunding project be without awesome perks?</p>
<p>There are a bunch of cool ways you can play a direct role in how the comic takes shape. You could get your own face drawn into the comic, write a line of dialogue for one of the characters, commission a <em>Special People</em> short story based on a character you create, or even help create the comic's main character!</p>
<p>For full details on all of the available perks, check the list in the sidebar.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's My Budget?</h3>
<p>To make the comic happen the way I want it to, I've set myself a budget of $1000. Here's where the money will go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Art: $100 per page x 8 pages = $800</p>
<p>Cover: $100</p>
<p>Lettering: $12 per page x 8 pages = $96</p>
<p><em>Total: $996</em></p>

</div></div>","Who I Am
My name is Tim Sevenhuysen. You might know me as the creator of FiftyWordStories.com, the guy behind the Year of Stories (where I post a new short story to my blog for free every Monday), or the author of the sci-fi series Losing Freight on 1889.ca and the superhero-with-a-twist series Special People. Maybe you've seen some of the sketch comedy I worked on with Loading Ready Run between 2008 and 2010.
For years, it's been my dream to be a full-time author. In late 2011 I decided to start actively pursuing that dream. Special People is one of the bigger projects I started up to help me achieve that goal. Special People is a web serial about people with unique and unusual powers and abilities. It’s superpower fiction with a fistful of twists. From a human cell phone to a man who can conjure bacon out of thin air, these are unique, interesting characters, special people with their own special problems…
 
What I'm Doing
I'm hoping to hire an artist and a letterer to create an 8-page, full-colour Special People comic based on my script. The comic will tell the story of the first special person Ian Innis recruits into his fledgling criminal community, from the perspective of that first recruit. The main character will be based on the man whose photo is featured in the Special People site banner:

I'd like to post the comic to the site at a rate of two pages per week during the month of July, 2012.
 


Why I'm Doing It
One of the hardest parts of starting up a new creative project online is building an initial audience, and comics are great for gathering in eyeballs. They're also really accessible and easy to share around. If I can get this comic made, it'll be a fantastic way to draw new people into the world of Special People.
In addition, the comic will establish a stronger visual identity for the franchise and make the ""Special People experience"" much more immersive and engaging.
On top of all that, having a comic on the site will pave the way for other creative projects in the Special People universe. I'd love to do more, longer comics, put together a series of videos with the help of my friends from Loading Ready Run, and of course keep churning out the fiction (and collecting it into novels and ebooks), but doing all of that will require both money and momentum. Seeing this comic successfully funded would definitely kickstart the rest of these projects!
 
Why You Should Get Involved: The Perks
What would a crowdfunding project be without awesome perks?
There are a bunch of cool ways you can play a direct role in how the comic takes shape. You could get your own face drawn into the comic, write a line of dialogue for one of the characters, commission a Special People short story based on a character you create, or even help create the comic's main character!
For full details on all of the available perks, check the list in the sidebar.
 


What's My Budget?
To make the comic happen the way I want it to, I've set myself a budget of $1000. Here's where the money will go.
 
Art: $100 per page x 8 pages = $800
Cover: $100
Lettering: $12 per page x 8 pages = $96
Total: $996

My friend Jon Lock, an independent comic writer from the UK, has helped me work out these numbers, and I'm hoping to use his contacts to hire an artist and letterer for the project. If his artist and letterer aren't available, I'll use DigitalWebbing.com to find and hire someone else.
If I don't reach my $1000 goal, I'll try to get the comic made using whatever budget I have available. That might mean doing it in black-and-white rather than colour or hiring a less experienced artist.
If I raise more than my goal, I'll put the extra money towards future Special People projects. For example, this might include

Video projects
A custom designed Special People website
Cool Special People merch
More comics

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A dark comic retelling of the classic Biblical story of death and resurrection. After being unwillingly brought back from purgatory by Jesus, Lazarus becomes immortal.</p>
<p>Lazarus hates living in Biblical times, preferring the cold dark nothingness of purgatory to a world where pork is illegal. He tries to kill himself, but nothing works.</p>
<p>We follow Lazarus to the mid-1990s, where he lives in a dying steel town called Impasse,Pennsylvania. There, Lazarus accidentally discovers his ability to resurrect the dead. With the help of his metalhead roommate and the reanimated corpse of his favorite musician, Lazarus embarks on a mission to force heaven to notice him, so he can finally die. He does this by committing sin after sin, setting his sights on hypocritical religious figures, celebrity cults and anyone who gets in his way.</p>
<p>Each book will be 35-40 pages in black + white with color front and back covers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FUNDING </strong></p>
<p><br/>We are trying to raise $3,600 to pay for books one and two of this ongoing graphic novel series. </p>
<p><br/>Book One is nearly finished, but the artists need to be paid and we need money for promotion and printing. This will total $1,800.</p>
<p>We hope to raise an additional $1,800 to pay for book two. If we reach or exceed our total goal of $3,600, everyone who has donated $10 or more will get a copy of book two in addition to their other incentives**</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>I've written a few feature screenplays and short films. My first feature, <strong>Buck Run </strong>made it to the second round of finals in the 2011 Final Draft Big Break Screenwriting Competition. </p>
<p>This is my first comic book, and I've found the experience very similar to writing for film. I have immensely enjoyed the opportunities for collaboration. Artist Ryan Gutierrez and Colorist Adam Cutrone have done a great job bringing my ideas to life. </p>

<h3>The Bare Bones:</h3>
<p>So, what is this piratey nonsense all about?</p>
<p>Weaponry is a webcomic that uploads free of charge every Monday, found at <a href=""http://www.otherworldscomics.com/weaponry.php"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://www.otherworldscomics.com/OWC/</a> as well as on DeviantART and Smackjeeves. It is a Choose Your Own Adventure comic, and a yaoi (or boy's love) tale of adventure, lawlessness and competition on the high seas. The readers are encouraged to voice their two-pennies, debate potential directions the story could go and defend their choices for reactions and pairings based on the canon pages. Then, at the end of every chapter, I offer up three different scenarios - one for each of the three protagonists - and the readers get to choose how they would like the story to continue.</p>
<p>So who am I? My name is Astra Crompton. I'm a working stiff by day, yet by night I write and publish novels, illustrate comics, and do freelance art and craft work. Being able to support myself fully through my art is a dream I'm working hard to fulfill.</p>
<p>Our Chapter One Fundraiser was a success, surpassing our goals and printing a beautiful print volume! You can <a href=""http://otherworldscomics.bigcartel.com/product/weaponry-chapter-one-weaponry-academy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""have a look here"">have a look at it here</a>, as it is a great example of what to expect out of Chapter Two. Like the first chapter, the print version will contain all of the online pages of Chapter Two: A Pirate's Life for Me (36 pages), it will also contain a bonus comic (18 pages), information about the world, bonus illustrations, Crossbones prose vignettes, cast profiles and more!</p>
<p>Not only will your generous donations enable me to print the first run of 100 copies, it will also enable the infrastructure to solidify. How's that exactly? This amount pays for the supplies for the incentives (left overs becoming extra merch) like t-shirts, post cards, prints and other extras. It provides much-needed funding for minor advertising to encourage readership and hopefully increase support for this relatively new comic (by ads on Smackjeeves and Y!Gallery), it also enables the website and Big Cartel sites to continue running smoothly so that everyone can enjoy this story for free.</p>
<p>Weaponry has received glowing compliments from its current readership for its realistic characters, rich colours, compelling writing and delicious character designs. If you already read Weaponry - I thank you. It is your feedback and encouragement that keeps my passion for this project running so high. If you have not yet read the tale, I entreat you to take a moment to read the first chapter and see what it is I'm trying to accomplish first hand. This initial step will set the stage for all the storytelling to come - and I'd love for you to be a part of it!</p>

<h3>Your Gold for Me Bounty</h3>
<p>Where does the money go?</p>
<p>$2000 is a modest request for a print endeavour, but every dollar is put to work. It enables:</p>
<p>~<strong>100 copies</strong> to be printed (including shipping from the printer to myself, import and customs duties, and basic shipping costs to send them on to you - if you are in North America)</p>
<p>~The cost of <strong>1 to 2 advertisments</strong> on similar webcomics' sites (I'm looking into SmackJeeves and Y!Gallery next)</p>
<p>~The cost for <strong>1 year of web hosting</strong> (both my url and web hoster, Big Cartel store website, and Smackjeeves donator account) to increase options and space so that I can offer bigger page display and more goods to you, the reader.</p>
<p>~The cost of the <strong>Incentives and merchandise</strong> that I hope to offer in the shop and at conventions. (This includes colour prints, t-shirts, post cards, key-chains, the art supplies for unique art and paintings, and one of a kind crafts like plushies and cosplay pieces) plus the cost of using IndieGoGo to facilitate the fundraising.</p>
<p><strong>And for thy generosity ye shall be rewarded!</strong></p>
<p>I've put together some really fun perks for funding this project! Please note that <strong>SOME PERKS HAVE OPTIONS</strong>! I wanted to offer a choice for those of you who missed out on the first chapter and might want a full bundle! <strong>Please read the descriptions of your perk levels so you can pick the best option for you and your budget!  </strong>Of course, you can always donate an amount to your own specification, and you can also upgrade your bundle at any time by adding to your donation. Just send me a note or post a comment to let me know what level you want to upgrade to!</p>
<p>Obviously, since I'm the sole creator of this comic, I'm also the only one filling the orders (including drawing the unique art and making your craft prizes) so please have patience as I fill all your orders. I'm looking forward to getting to know you during this fundraiser and will try my best to draw you your favourite characters for incentives and on the livestreams while the fundraiser is happening.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the goal is on the barebones end of the comic funding spectrum, I understand that thus far, Weaponry's reach is small. I know that many of you are much in the same boat as I am, and your boundless love for my comic does nothing to line your pockets. It is a very real possibility that I will not be able to raise the needed funds. If not, cuts will need to be made - the advertising &amp; website fees will be the first to be culled, as much as doing so will hamstring the future of the comic. I will use every raised dollar to ensure all of the incentives are fullfilled, even if it means I need to continue to raise the funds needed to do so, on my own afterwards.</p>
<p>Conversely, if, by some miracle of the Pastafarian Angels, we <strong>EXCEED</strong> the targeted goal - my solemn pledge is that every extra dollar will go to buying more copies of the comic to take around to conventions and sell on the online shop. The revenue from their sales will hopefully fuel the other costs this comic incrues to keep it going for Chapter Two and beyond. I'll also be offering <strong>bonus art</strong> to everyone who has pledged in the form of exclusive wallpapers, gift art, and anything else I can manage to illustrate my overwhelming joy.</p>
