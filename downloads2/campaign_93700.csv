<h3>The Short of it:<br/>
</h3>
<p>Since I started shooting I've always dreamed about having creating a complete photo studio (see some of my work above).  Seeing as how I live in a loft in the middle of downtown San Diego, that studio will have to be in my living room.  I am offering prints in several sizes delivered to your doorstep, all the way up to a personal 2 hour photo shoot and image editing as rewards.  Please see the box to the right, I'm hooking people up who want to help out.<br/></p>

<h3>What I Need <br/>
</h3>Here's the deal, I've already spent a few thousand bucks on equipment and just got a big tax bill from the IRS which puts my project behind.  I shoot for the love of the art- not for money.  That said, studio lighting equipment is expensive and since I don't typically charge for my work I need your help to finish getting the rest of the gear needed to complete the studio.  It will also allow me to contribute more tutorials on lighting and photography techniques to <a href=""http://mikenewton.com/category/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Mike Newton Blog"">http://mikenewton.com/category/blog/</a> <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Here is what I need:</span><br/>$718= (2)- Alien Bee 1600 Flash Heads: $359/each (I need 2, I already bought one)<br/>$198= (2)-13 ft. air cushioned light stands- $99/each (I need 2, I already bought one)<br/>$26= (2) -carrying bags to hold the AB1600s- $13/each= <br/>$299= (1)- Vagabond battery pack- now I can use on location!<br/><span id=""internal-source-marker_0.899654413304226"" style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;""></span>$240= (2) Alien Bees strip boxes- $120/each<br/>$149= (1) Alien Bees medium octobox<br/>$119= (1) Alien Bees medium soft box<br/>$138= (2) Alien Bees cyber sync's - $69 each (I need 2, I already bought 3) <br/>$600= (2) Nikon SB-800 speed lights (used price on Craigslist) (I need 2, I already bought one) <br/>$140= (2) light stands for SB-800's (I need 2, already bought 3)<br/>$70= (1) boom arm <br/>$129= (1) 28"" Apollo soft box kit<br/>$32= (4) sandbags- to keep the light stands grounded, I broke 2 umbrellas when the stands blew over last month.<br/>$50= reflector arm/holder<br/>$89= (1) 10'x20' Diamond Cloth black backdrop<br/>$60= (1) white seamless paper roll (mine is almost too ripped to use, time for a replacement)<br/><br/>$3057= Total needed to finish up the studio (as well as be able to take it on location as well). <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">IF I HIT MY GOAL:</span> I will do a good ole' Irish Jig and probably loose sleep by shooting photos until I pass out.  I will pick up all the gear on my list and complete the studio.<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><br/><h3>What You Get</h3>

<br/>
<br/><h3>Hey everyone, my name is Alex Coghe.  I am an Italian street 
photographer; I am currently based in Mexico.  After 3 years in 2013 I 
managed to return to Italy for a month.</h3>
<br/>During that time I started a 
photo project, titled ITALIA DOLCE VITA between street photography and 
documentary and this work has become something more than I could have 
ever expected.  I recently published the first part of this project with
 the clear intention to complete it when I will have the opportunity to 
come back in my hometown. To make this real I need your support and donations.<br/><br/><h3></h3>
<h3>WHAT DESTINATIONS WILL HAVE YOUR DONATIONS IF I WILL ACHIEVE THE GOAL?</h3>
<p><b>Achieving the goal will lead me to realize a printed  book, a series 
of e-books, special posts on my blog, and when in Italy conferences, 
workshops and an exhibition. There will be also the opportunity to meet 
me for those supported the project in Italy and I will insert them on my
 printed book.</b><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>A PRINTED BOOK<br/>
</li>
<li>2 FREE STREET PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOPS IN ROMA (ITALIA)*</li>
<li>1 FREE STREET PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOP IN FIRENZE (ITALIA)*</li>
<li>1 FREE STREET PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOP IN MILANO (ITALIA)*</li>
<li>A WEEKLY EDITION MAGAZINE ""ITALIA, DOLCE VITA"" PDF E-BOOK EDITION I WILL PROPOSE <span>FOR ALL MY STAY IN ITALY</span> <br/>
</li>
<li>SEVERAL E-BOOKS CONTAINING SPECIAL PHOTOS FROM THE PROJECT, PRESENTED AS MINI-PROJECTS<br/>
</li>
<li>A SPECIAL E-BOOK CONTAINING PHOTOS MADE IN ITALY FROM STREET PHOTOGRAPHERS, CURATED BY ME</li>
<li>A PERSONAL DIARY PUBLISHED THROUGH <a href=""http://www.alexcoghe.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MY BLOG</a> ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE IN ITALY, WITH CONTINOUS UPDATES<br/>
</li>
<li>Accomodations and Travel expenses for me in Italy (the air travel Mexico-Italy-Mexico is very expensive)<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*THE WORKSHOPS WILL BE FOR A MAXIMUM OF 5 ASSISTANTS EACH WITH THE CLASSIC FORMULA INCLUDING MY GUIDE TO STREET PHOTOGRAPHY, ILLIMITED FEEDBACK, PARTICIPATION CERTIFICATE AND PUBLISHING OPPORTUNITIES</p>
<p></p>
<h3>WHAT IF I WILL NOT ACHIEVE THE GOAL?</h3>
<p><span>I really would not want to take even consider this hypothesis</span>, but in any case the project already exists and the perks <span>that I thought for my funders are sent almost instantly (24h max.). There are perks as you can see with rewards that I can offer only when the goal is achieved, but to the deadline, depending by the result of the campaign, I considered alternative stuff to honor and thank the funder.</span></p>
<p><span>The formula is the Flexible Funding: this means in any case the money donated is mine. If we will be near to the goal I could think to make an effort and going to Italy in order to complete my project, clearly, with a lower budget <span>and some programs will be reviewed</span>, in any case any donor is sure of his reward. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>If the donations collected will not allow to go in Italy the money will be invested to feed my other project here in Mexico dedicated to barrios.</span></p>
<p><span>Whatever will be the result the funders and me will be winners.<br/></span></p>

realized are just the start up of a project documenting Italy from a 
particular point of view. In the title I mention the golden age 
(1958-1964) in a style known throughout the world, LA DOLCE VITA, the 
sweet life of the famous Fellini movie with the unforgettable Marcello 
Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg, where it was evoked remarkably that 
indulgence typically Italian, that pleasure induced by eating well and 
dine a good wine, to enjoy staying at the table to talk, to crowd the 
beaches during the summer, maybe singing the last smash hit. In this 
project, aided by the physical distance from my country lasting three 
years, I want to document a country that basically has not changed too 
much in his research of being and living well, with food culture and art
 that permeates every level of Italian society, where even if you do not
 care much about Art and History you’ll anyway influenced because it is 
everywhere and permeates the lives of everyone who lives in the Old 
Boot.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441544431/m9fliyzdek9f2iep3djc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>The Italians know how to enjoy life despite the economic 
crisis, despite the political situation. So you can see them still 
there, at the bar in the morning to drink their coffee, maybe eating a 
croissant. You can see them come together in the streets, well-dressed 
with fine linen shirts and sunglasses, with a newspaper under their arm.
 A lifestyle that ends up to involve the many foreigners who flock to 
the peninsula, even just  as tourists. I wish that those who observe 
this project consisting, at the moment, of 100 photographs,  focus on the 
clothes and colors, on the details of each photograph because it is with
 this approach that I decided to photograph and present this project. 
Through the many color images I tried to tell my country, now that I see
 it inevitably with different eyes, although I am still absolutely and 
proudly Italian. Now even more than before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I went back 
to review and edit these photographs only now. After two years of their 
creation, in May of 2013. I published the first part of this ongoing project on my official website and I created a facebook page dedicated to this project. I was surprised to dwell
 on some of these images because they appear  timeless in my eyes, like a
 slightly faded memory. Some photographs could be taken in the 70s or 
80s and very little would change, I think. I want to think about this 
series of photographs as an open project, because I desire to return to 
continue to document my beloved Italy. Italia Dolce Vita.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441544988/fqxuozqoheenfz7jouyk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>This 
project wants to be not just a set of visually appealing images, but I 
see it as a vehicle and a means to further fund my goals to create a 
book with this work.  With the help of you guys, this can be the next 
step in the direction of coming back to my country to complete this 
project. Your contributions will enable the completion of this project, 
which wants to provide a unique perspective of an Italian, living far 
from his hometown, looking at Italy with a different vision.  <br/><br/>In 
supporting the completion of this project, you will not only be giving 
me the opportunity to feed ITALIA DOLCE VITA, but purchasing some 
interesting artistic opportunities for yourself. In fact my return to 
Italy will coincide with various opportunities for my funders, also to 
take a workshop with me or just a coffee. I thought to a social 
media site like Indiegogo,  because despite to be a professional 
photographer today is still hard and I can’t think to sustain a project 
like this without your help. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441545269/bhyxfobhayjv7jzxlyfd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

different territories and stories.This is why I'm asking for your contributions, whether you have five Euro to offer or fifty thousand. <br/><br/>The
 minimum Euro amount for the realization of this project has been set at
 Euro 10,000.  This amount of money will allow me to go in Italy , 
without worries and fears while completing my work for my fans.  <br/><br/>In 
support of my fans, I have created an awesome perks section, located on 
this page.  Look there to view the numerous perks in store for those who

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Frankly, the biggest challenge of this project is simply completing this project in order to offer something different for approach and vision: as a photographer I am focused on positive things, despite <span>the many problems of everyday life</span> . As a street and documentary photographer I want to document my hometown, from a special point of view, <span>that of a man no longer living in his country</span>.<br/></p>
<p>As a photographer, my main challenge is the next picture! As a commercial photographer working on assignment I have the skills to work under pressure and I know how to make a fantastic photographic work.<br/></p>
<p>The project already exists and the fulfillment of this is less of a challenge, as the rewards 
are chosen from images and services that already exist, and i can offer immediately to the funder. If you make a donation 
to the project, what you see is what you will get: this means there is no danger of
 a reward not being produced. <br/></p>
<p><span>When everything is finally defined because we have achieved</span> there will be brands with me during the time of realization of this project in Italy.</p>
<p>OTHER THINGS CAN HAPPEN WHEN IN ITALY</p>
<p>If I will reach the goal there will be other side events I will make. In particular:</p>
<p>- Free Workshops in Rome, Florence, Milan;</p>
<p>- Meetings and conferences;</p>
<p>- An exhibition;<br/></p>

ITALIA, DOLCE VITA: a printed book documenting the lifestyle of Italians through the eyes of an Italian street photographer, currently based in Mexico. 








Hey everyone, my name is Alex Coghe.  I am an Italian street 
photographer; I am currently based in Mexico.  After 3 years in 2013 I 
managed to return to Italy for a month.
During that time I started a 
photo project, titled ITALIA DOLCE VITA between street photography and 
documentary and this work has become something more than I could have 
ever expected.  I recently published the first part of this project with
 the clear intention to complete it when I will have the opportunity to 
come back in my hometown. To make this real I need your support and donations.
WHAT DESTINATIONS WILL HAVE YOUR DONATIONS IF I WILL ACHIEVE THE GOAL?
Achieving the goal will lead me to realize a printed  book, a series 
of e-books, special posts on my blog, and when in Italy conferences, 
workshops and an exhibition. There will be also the opportunity to meet 
me for those supported the project in Italy and I will insert them on my
 printed book.

A PRINTED BOOK

2 FREE STREET PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOPS IN ROMA (ITALIA)*
1 FREE STREET PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOP IN FIRENZE (ITALIA)*
1 FREE STREET PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOP IN MILANO (ITALIA)*
A WEEKLY EDITION MAGAZINE ""ITALIA, DOLCE VITA"" PDF E-BOOK EDITION I WILL PROPOSE FOR ALL MY STAY IN ITALY 

SEVERAL E-BOOKS CONTAINING SPECIAL PHOTOS FROM THE PROJECT, PRESENTED AS MINI-PROJECTS

A SPECIAL E-BOOK CONTAINING PHOTOS MADE IN ITALY FROM STREET PHOTOGRAPHERS, CURATED BY ME
A PERSONAL DIARY PUBLISHED THROUGH MY BLOG ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE IN ITALY, WITH CONTINOUS UPDATES

Accomodations and Travel expenses for me in Italy (the air travel Mexico-Italy-Mexico is very expensive)


*THE WORKSHOPS WILL BE FOR A MAXIMUM OF 5 ASSISTANTS EACH WITH THE CLASSIC FORMULA INCLUDING MY GUIDE TO STREET PHOTOGRAPHY, ILLIMITED FEEDBACK, PARTICIPATION CERTIFICATE AND PUBLISHING OPPORTUNITIES

WHAT IF I WILL NOT ACHIEVE THE GOAL?
I really would not want to take even consider this hypothesis, but in any case the project already exists and the perks that I thought for my funders are sent almost instantly (24h max.). There are perks as you can see with rewards that I can offer only when the goal is achieved, but to the deadline, depending by the result of the campaign, I considered alternative stuff to honor and thank the funder.
The formula is the Flexible Funding: this means in any case the money donated is mine. If we will be near to the goal I could think to make an effort and going to Italy in order to complete my project, clearly, with a lower budget and some programs will be reviewed, in any case any donor is sure of his reward. 
If the donations collected will not allow to go in Italy the money will be invested to feed my other project here in Mexico dedicated to barrios.
Whatever will be the result the funders and me will be winners.

<strong>OUR HISTOR</strong><strong>Y</strong>
</h2>
<p>Three years ago we started Settentrionale Sicula with a strong belief in the necessity of independent and free investigation journalism in Sicily. Since then we are going on struggling criminality, corruption, mafia, with the idea to provide our area, Eastern Sicily, with an independent publication that shed light on social and political issues through good old-fashioned story telling.</p>
<p>During this time our staff has grown from a handful of brave and crazy people to a thriving volunteer staff. Settentrionale Sicula is a labor of love for each of us.  It costs a lot to print our seasonal issues, as well as pay for our working/meeting space and keep the public events we organize every month going on running. That's where you can help us keep Settentrionale Sicula alive, giving us the possibility to grow and supporting indipendent journalism in Sicily.</p>
<p>Here you can find our blog: <a href=""http://settentrionalesicula.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://settentrionalesicula.blogspot.com</a></p>
<p>and our magazines: <a href=""http://issuu.com/settentrionalesicula/docs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://issuu.com/settentrionalesicula/docs</a></p>
<h2>THE POWER OF LOCAL INVESTIGATION JOURNALISM</h2>
<p>To build an independent journalist voice in Sicily is something extremely difficult. Our territory is dramatically tied to an historical culture of silence, something that every sicilian perceives as an inescapable fact. Our presence, our work, made a little change in our area during the last 3 years. We had to defend ourselves against threats, attacks, insults, but we showed to the people that it is possible to build something different, that is possible to make a change. We have become a reference point for all the people that feel to react to the mafia culture in Western Sicily, thanks to our reports but also thanks to the events that we organize every month in every little village around the city of Messina.</p>
<h2>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</h2>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">Settentrionale Sicula is asking for your financial support to mantain, expand and develop our investigation journalism, to reach and involve more people. </span><br/><span class=""notranslate"">We're focusing on three specific goals right now: </span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><strong>1</strong>. To gain exposure and let become our work more visible we want to renovate our online space, creating an official website that will work together with our blog. </span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate"">- To build our new platform we´ll need to ask to a professional webmaster, so this would cost around $2.500 and $3.000<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><strong>2</strong>. We decided to realize a videodocumentary about the buildings confiscated to Mafia all around Sicily. The documentary will show the conditions of neglect of these buildings (apartments, villas, old factories, farms, agricultural lands), managed by the local institutions and completely forgotten. We think these properties should be renovated and than delivered to sicilian people in order to increase the possibilities to use public spaces and give a strong signal against criminality.<br/>The documentary will be realized, for free, by Mauro Mondello and Nunzio Gringeri with the cooperation of the Settentrionale Sicula team. Mauro Mondello, 30 years old, is a free lance journalist, director of Settentrionale Sicula, with a long experience as a correspondent from South America and Middle East. Nunzio Gringeri, 31 years old, Settentrionale Sicula art director, is a videomaker and student at the Italian E</span></span></span><span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">xperimental Centre</span> <span class=""hps"">of Cinematography. In 2012 Mauro e Nunzio realized ""Stateless"", <a href=""http://vimeo.com/51201940"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/51201940,</a> a documentary about the dramatic daily life of thousands of migrants fled from Lybia after the rebellion against Gheddafi. Stateless has been screened in many festival around Europe.<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate"">- To realize the documentary we´ll need to consider equipments, editing and production costs, that will be around $4.500 and $5.000<br/></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><strong>3</strong>. We´ve been thinking about the possibility to establish an investigation training center with our editorial staff. The idea is to involve as many people as possibile in our project through training courses in radiojournalism, videojournalism and reporting.

<p> </p></div>","OUR HISTORY

Three years ago we started Settentrionale Sicula with a strong belief in the necessity of independent and free investigation journalism in Sicily. Since then we are going on struggling criminality, corruption, mafia, with the idea to provide our area, Eastern Sicily, with an independent publication that shed light on social and political issues through good old-fashioned story telling.
During this time our staff has grown from a handful of brave and crazy people to a thriving volunteer staff. Settentrionale Sicula is a labor of love for each of us.  It costs a lot to print our seasonal issues, as well as pay for our working/meeting space and keep the public events we organize every month going on running. That's where you can help us keep Settentrionale Sicula alive, giving us the possibility to grow and supporting indipendent journalism in Sicily.
Here you can find our blog: http://settentrionalesicula.blogspot.com
and our magazines: http://issuu.com/settentrionalesicula/docs
THE POWER OF LOCAL INVESTIGATION JOURNALISM
To build an independent journalist voice in Sicily is something extremely difficult. Our territory is dramatically tied to an historical culture of silence, something that every sicilian perceives as an inescapable fact. Our presence, our work, made a little change in our area during the last 3 years. We had to defend ourselves against threats, attacks, insults, but we showed to the people that it is possible to build something different, that is possible to make a change. We have become a reference point for all the people that feel to react to the mafia culture in Western Sicily, thanks to our reports but also thanks to the events that we organize every month in every little village around the city of Messina.
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET
Settentrionale Sicula is asking for your financial support to mantain, expand and develop our investigation journalism, to reach and involve more people. We're focusing on three specific goals right now: 
1. To gain exposure and let become our work more visible we want to renovate our online space, creating an official website that will work together with our blog. 
- To build our new platform we´ll need to ask to a professional webmaster, so this would cost around $2.500 and $3.000
2. We decided to realize a videodocumentary about the buildings confiscated to Mafia all around Sicily. The documentary will show the conditions of neglect of these buildings (apartments, villas, old factories, farms, agricultural lands), managed by the local institutions and completely forgotten. We think these properties should be renovated and than delivered to sicilian people in order to increase the possibilities to use public spaces and give a strong signal against criminality.The documentary will be realized, for free, by Mauro Mondello and Nunzio Gringeri with the cooperation of the Settentrionale Sicula team. Mauro Mondello, 30 years old, is a free lance journalist, director of Settentrionale Sicula, with a long experience as a correspondent from South America and Middle East. Nunzio Gringeri, 31 years old, Settentrionale Sicula art director, is a videomaker and student at the Italian Experimental Centre of Cinematography. In 2012 Mauro e Nunzio realized ""Stateless"", http://vimeo.com/51201940, a documentary about the dramatic daily life of thousands of migrants fled from Lybia after the rebellion against Gheddafi. Stateless has been screened in many festival around Europe.
- To realize the documentary we´ll need to consider equipments, editing and production costs, that will be around $4.500 and $5.000
3. We´ve been thinking about the possibility to establish an investigation training center with our editorial staff. The idea is to involve as many people as possibile in our project through training courses in radiojournalism, videojournalism and reporting. The training courses will be held, for free, by qualified member of Messina University and Settentrionale Sicula members.
- To go on with the training center project we´ll need to cover equipment and running costs for $3.000
All levels of donations come with a gift to show our vast appreciation, listed on the right hand side of this page. Every dollar counts. And please help us spread the word!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Napier Photo Collective involves fourth year photography students from Edinburgh Napier University who, every year, come together to plan an ambitious exhibition as part of the Free Range festival in London.<br/><br/>Now that this academic year has come to an end, we will take our graduate work to exhibit in London at The Free Range Graduate Art and Design exhibition, the largest of its kind, where universities from all across the United Kingdom will showcase their work. Throughout June and July, this space is host to graduates from creative degrees and, from the 21st to the 25th June 2018, we will display our work alongside other photography graduates from across the country. Free Range holds invaluable networking and exposure opportunities for both ourselves as individuals, as well as a group collectively representing Edinburgh Napier University.<br/>The work that will be exhibited at Free Range will offer a variety of stylistic approaches that represent the members of the collective, as well as the university as a whole, at the highest possible standard.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite having launched an Indiegogo campaign earlier this year which raised over £1000, we are still struggling to make ends meet. The money we have raised so far has helped us with costs towards production, accommodation and refreshments for the opening night. This art business doesn't come cheap though!</p>
<p>Our goal with this new campaign is to raise £600 to cover the cost of hiring a van to transport our work down to London, as well as producing high quality catalogues to offer our audience at Free Range. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are extremely grateful for all the financial help we have already received, and we really hope you'll be able to help us a little more to make this adventure of ours work! </p>
<p>To help us achieve our goal, we have come up with a number of different juicy perks that you can choose from. We'd love to give something back to you and make you a part of the exhibition, so we are offering a number of prints from the work we will be exhibiting in London (see gallery at the top), as well as the catalogue of the exhibition itself! </p>
<p>If amazing perks just don't do it for you, don't worry! You can also pick any other amount to donate to our cause - all help given is greatly appreciated!</p>

<h3>What is ""Serenity of the Smokies""</h3>
<p><span>""Serenity of the Smokies"" (formerly called Spirit of the Smokies) is a passion project for artist Willy Adkins. Adkins was inspired by his life long love of the Smoky's and after a few years of park research and planning, he began the project in 2006 with the ultimate goal of publishing a coffee table photo book featuring the natural beauty of The Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Since beginning the project, it has now grown to include a feature length DVD and also a soundtrack CD both featuring original music by Dc McAuliffe (</span><a href=""http://www.dcmcauliffe.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.<span class=""text_exposed_show"">dcmcauliffe.com</span></a><span class=""text_exposed_show"">).</span></p>

<li>1 trips back to the national park (I'm located in Illinois) this November to finish off Photo &amp; Video including Black Bear, Elk, and Autumn color scenes.  (This obviously involves costs in travel, my largest expense in this project and equipment rentals).</li>
<li>Book proofing, editing (as I hope to include inspirational quotes and/or information about the Smokies) and printing (hardcovers don't come cheap).</li>
<li>For the movie, post production software, original music score, DVD menu design (and software), physical DVD copies and two hard drives.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In April, I made the decision to take my photography hobby and turn it into a career. It has been by far one of the best and most challenging decisions I have ever made. I had never really photographed people until this year as my focus was always on wildlife and landscape. I never dreamed just how rewarding and humbling it would be to work with people in this way. Capturing the love and those big moments that we experience is one of the most important things in life. These images last a lifetime and show us new things about ourselves and they can help us remember what once was.</p>
<p>I've got a great start, but I can tell that I need to continue to learn. I found out about <a href=""http://www.letsgoworkshop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Let's Go!! Workshop</a> via some photographers I follow on Instagram and it seemed like the perfect fit. I'll be learning from industry experts on topics from posing to editing and more. And here's the big thing: I'll be capturing some styled shoots that will help strengthen my portfolio so that I can take things to the next level. My dream is to photograph intimate weddings, elopements, and destination weddings which is exactly what this workshop is geared toward. Plus, it's on the coast of Oregon so it's in basically the dreamiest spot ever and the results of the styled shoots are bound to be amazing! But this all comes at a price, one that's a little hard to afford as a freelance artist/single income family. </p>
<p>That's where you come in! I've secured my spot in the workshop, but am looking for a way to help offset the cost by offering mini-sessions in exchange for donations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are perks to donating.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of the workshop is $1500 and the ticket to PDX about $250. I'm trying to offset as much of this cost as possible, so the goal is to raise about $1750.</li>
<li>Been dreaming of getting some up-to-date family photos but not so thrilled by the idea of $350-600 for a session? Have an anniversary coming up that you'd like to document? Donations above $50 will receive mini-sessions in the local SD, OC, and Riverside county area. Donations above $100 will receive a full session in the area.</li>
<li>If I don't reach the full $1750, whatever I do raise will still go to helping offset the cost of the trip.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This workshop will have a huge impact on my life and career. It may well be the thing that really gets things going for me! It'll certainly be a foot in the door for the destination/intimate wedding industry, and that's priceless. </p>

If I don't reach the full $1750, whatever I do raise will still go to helping offset the cost of the trip.


The Impact
This workshop will have a huge impact on my life and career. It may well be the thing that really gets things going for me! It'll certainly be a foot in the door for the destination/intimate wedding industry, and that's priceless.

<p><span>Charles was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in May, 2003. For several years he has been the MS patient who no one knew he had any neurological issues, especially MS. He walked on his own, he was active, he ran his own photography business and, taught figure skating to kids a couple days a week. In June of 2011, things drastically changed. (for him). He started noticing that the shins on his right leg were numb. He just took it as part of his MS letting him know it was there. Soon he began tripping and falling a lot--which was unlike him. His doctors diagnosed him with a symptom of MS called </span><span>Drop Foot.</span><span> Drop foot occurs when the brain sends a signal to the nerves in the foot to lift up when people walk but the message never reaches the foot. It's very similar to a 'short' in electrical wiring. When the toes don't lift up, you trip and fall a lot. Charles' condition has progressed since then and he has had to stop working and stop teaching skating. He walks with a cane and despite the use of an Ankle Foot Orthotic (AFO) he still trips and falls 3-5 times a week. Because of these issues, he deals with a lot of spasticity in his legs where the muscles lock up and make moving very difficult and extremely painful. This is not a safe scenario for <em>anyone</em> at <em>any</em> age.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>In December Charles' doctors wanted him to try a new electronic stimulation brace to see if it would be of any benefit. It's the Bioness Ness L300. Charles did a 10 day trial of the brace and the results were amazing. He was able to walk unassisted, no fatigue issues, no tripping, no falling and, no spasticity issues for the entire 10 days he used the brace.  He was able, for the first time in months, to get his life back! He was able to take hikes and, most of all, he was able to work, shoot images and not worry about tripping or falling. He was shooting more images in those ten days than he had in the previous 18 months. At the end of the trial period, he had to return this 'MAGICAL' brace which had done so much to help him.  He just fell right back where he had been prior to using the brace, a brace which had worked wonders. His doctors and physical therapist could not believe the improvement during the brief time he used the brace.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The doctors began the paperwork necessary to file with his insurance company, a company which denied the claim. Multiple doctors wrote letters of medical necessity; however, the company continues to deny the claim. The Bioness L300 has been on the market for well over five years and has FDA approval for MS patients who suffer from Drop Foot. The insurance company deems the brace as ""experimental,"" thus providing them a 'way out' of covering its' cost of $6,500.00. A device which would allow Charles the independence necessary to return to work and become a productive member of society, all of which are key points for someone who is 35 years old and has two daughters, ages 15 and 8.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>There are so many people who are milking the system and getting state and federal assistance.  Then you have someone like Charles who has a business he desperately wants to return to and become a productive member, not  just to his family but, to society as a whole.  This one device could give him back what Multiple Sclerosis has taken away in the recent months.  </span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Impact</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If enough money can be raised to purchase this device, it would give Charles his life and his independence back. He would be able to walk without constant fear of falling. It would also eliminate much of the spasticity he has in his legs. Charles would be able to go back to work and reopen the business he loves and be able to, once again, teach tomorrow's skaters. Inability to obtain this brace means none of this will be possible.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What We Need </strong></span></p>
<p><span>The Bioness L300 price is $6,500.00. Our ultimate goal is to raise enough to purchase a brace for Charles. Bioness also has a program by which patients can rent a brace for $600.00 per month and the monies spent on brace rental can be applied to the purchase price. We just need help with raising the funds to either begin renting a brace each month or to purchase the brace out right. It's time to allow people to become more cognizant of the fact that not everyone is as frigid as insurance companies. It's time to ban together and return Charles to his independence, get his creative jucies flowing so that more beautiful images may be created.

<p>Meanwhile, here’s a variation on my recent v2 card. I built four of these LED-backlit WTC Window Treatments for a show in Vegas this summer. They measure a mere 11 by 14 inches, and mistakes were made, so getting them put together nearly did me in.  The WTC 3 W.T. shown here is also available, in a quantity of one, as a Perk:</p>

<p>My WTCsunsets series was keep private for more than five years after the Twin Tower tragedy out of respect for its victims, and are the only images of their kind. The photo below has the appearance of a face within the ‘Angel Face’ in the cloud.  These faces were something that no-one around me noticed until years after I selected the 4 as my first postcard (v1):</p>

<p>It’s serendipitous that the building from which I took these photos is suddenly becoming famous. As noted above, the hot and highly respected new novel by Tim Murphy, “Christodora” is set in and titled after this 88-year-old brick skyscraper that towers over Manhattan’s entire Lower East Side from its park-side corner at 9th Street and Avenue B.</p>
<p>I have ambitious interlocking plans for promoting myself and my creative work over the next year. Luckily for me, circumstances have recently dictated that I become highly organized...</p>
<p>My 60 day plan calls for me to do one of the following every 10 days: either produce a new postcard or post new perks and/or a fresh video here. Meanwhile, here is my latest brand-new work, a4-ft.-wide hardwood construction of frames in a frame, titled “WTCsunsets Red, White &amp; Blues."" (It required that I drill 24 dowel holes almost precisely 3/8 inches deep, and gave me something to shoot for my v3 postcard.)</p>

<p><strong>Use of funds</strong>: I’ll work to gain national recognition for the memorial WTCs through:</p>
<p>1. Entering art contests: Although I had become the most frequently selected artist in ArtJury.com competitions by 2011, and have since had WTCs up in five minor shows, I have yet to get represented by a major gallery or gotten art magazine (or any other) media coverage.</p>
<p>2. Developing novel art displays / constructs: I concocted the WTC Window Treatments (WTC WTs) this June for a month-long Emergency Arts show here in Vegas . They were my most-est cleverest art constructs to date.  And, as you've seen, I followed that up with my first-ever WTC WaLT (Wall Treatment), which actually went together without a single hitch. Thus re-invigorated, I may even now have a follow-up idea or two.</p>
<p>3. Getting into prestigious galleries and shows. Through a spring competition, I was selected to hang works in the secondary Spectrum section of the art world’s important Art Basel/Miami show this December. They have now accepted my proposal to hang a WTC Red White and Blue WaLT above a set of my wee W.T.s.</p>
<p>This could be great for me, and definitely expensive, but if the art world remains asleep at the switch this could be a necessary catalyst to making the WTCsunsets renowned. Meanwhile, those works are now hanging in the heart of our Art District, where they're owning their own freestanding wall.</p>
<p>4. Charity: Even though gallery commissions and taxes will take big bites out of sales, I will be donating 7% of all net proceeds to Doctors Without Borders or other institution or cause. Since I’m not only broke, but  launching this campaign before any sales from my major September art show (and now about $3,600 freshly down in card charges) I might donate the 3/5 print to NYC’s Engine Company # 10 and give myself a credit against that 7% vig. </p>
<p>As for my current art show, here's the deal. Basically, I’ve got a 150 sq. ft. freestanding wall alongside a 250 sq. ft. lobby floor space leading into the doors of Jana’s Red Room.  That’s ground floor in The Arts Factory (aka 'Arf?'), where my WTC Wall will feature temporarily hung WTC Works on 9/10 (Jana’s annual by-invitation-only art party), during an afternoon reception on 9/11, and for an Industry+ closing party 9/19. </p>
<p>On other times and days, I’ll just have my underlying ‘placeholder posters’ showing.</p>
<p>Then, in early October, I’m once again slated to show works in public. This time at the (Covered) ‘Bridges of Madison County’ show, in my Iowa birthplace (also John Wayne’s). The theme of the festival is Pioneer Days, so I plan to build an authentic-looking 10’ by 10’ Meyer’s Specific Store to show off some of my works. (Think rustic window frames with surprising window views out from within, frames-in-a-frame groups of same-site photos from my Missouri “Show Me Silos Series”,  etc.)  Regional news coverage would be likely because there is really, like, not all that much going on in nearby Des Moines.</p>
<p>I might also stage a pop-up art show in Kansas City on 11/11, WWI’s Armistice Day and the 10th anniversary of the day I unveiled the WTCs - although I’d rather be caught up in a massive online casting competition for up to 5 SeaBabe movie roles just then (see the Become a Movie Mogul perk here).  </p>
<p>Otherwise, that show, in the city where I grew up, would feature my cool patriotic Double Ought 7 (aka ‘007) Lib. Mem. photos. Captured in 2007, this series offers inspiring/cool images of our majestic National WWI Liberty Memorial.  Shown below, ""007 Force"" and the ""Double Ought 7 Salute.""</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my v3 postcard has been going out to about 330 of my contacts.</p>
<p>Lastly, the image below is of the WTC #2, and the # 3 of 5 prints is being offered here as a highly collectable perk.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473169292/qxppp1erolkk52dmqtaq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Anyway, that’s about it from here if I ever want to get everything else for this campaign polished and uploaded sometime this century.  Under the Extras tab here, you can learn a lot more of the interesting backstory to the Christodora and its WTCs.</p>

As for my current art show, here's the deal. Basically, I’ve got a 150 sq. ft. freestanding wall alongside a 250 sq. ft. lobby floor space leading into the doors of Jana’s Red Room.  That’s ground floor in The Arts Factory (aka 'Arf?'), where my WTC Wall will feature temporarily hung WTC Works on 9/10 (Jana’s annual by-invitation-only art party), during an afternoon reception on 9/11, and for an Industry+ closing party 9/19. 
On other times and days, I’ll just have my underlying ‘placeholder posters’ showing.
Then, in early October, I’m once again slated to show works in public. This time at the (Covered) ‘Bridges of Madison County’ show, in my Iowa birthplace (also John Wayne’s). The theme of the festival is Pioneer Days, so I plan to build an authentic-looking 10’ by 10’ Meyer’s Specific Store to show off some of my works. (Think rustic window frames with surprising window views out from within, frames-in-a-frame groups of same-site photos from my Missouri “Show Me Silos Series”,  etc.)  Regional news coverage would be likely because there is really, like, not all that much going on in nearby Des Moines.
I might also stage a pop-up art show in Kansas City on 11/11, WWI’s Armistice Day and the 10th anniversary of the day I unveiled the WTCs - although I’d rather be caught up in a massive online casting competition for up to 5 SeaBabe movie roles just then (see the Become a Movie Mogul perk here).  
Otherwise, that show, in the city where I grew up, would feature my cool patriotic Double Ought 7 (aka ‘007) Lib. Mem. photos. Captured in 2007, this series offers inspiring/cool images of our majestic National WWI Liberty Memorial.  Shown below, ""007 Force"" and the ""Double Ought 7 Salute.""

Meanwhile, my v3 postcard has been going out to about 330 of my contacts.
Lastly, the image below is of the WTC #2, and the # 3 of 5 prints is being offered here as a highly collectable perk.

Anyway, that’s about it from here if I ever want to get everything else for this campaign polished and uploaded sometime this century.  Under the Extras tab here, you can learn a lot more of the interesting backstory to the Christodora and its WTCs.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>     My name is Victoria (""Vico"") Velez and I'm a 23 year old photography student and aspiring fashion, beauty and music photographer. My passion for this medium and my burning ambition have driven me out of my hometown of Mexico City, to the city of Los Angeles in order to pursuit a career in this field and an education. That same ambition led me to my idol's doorstep, where I now intern with one of the world's greatest photographers who fuels my inspiration every week.

I've realized how much the little things add up, and how much money my little creative mind has racked up in the passed months.</p>

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>Tumblr and Humans of New York are teaming up to raise money for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. For ten days beginning November 11th, we will be documenting and sharing the stories of those affected by the storm. We hope to show all sides of the story, featuring not only the victims of the storm but also the first responders and volunteers who are helping them recover. Hurricane Sandy revealed the power of nature, as well as the power of humanity. We aim to document both. By doing so, we hope to encourage YOU to contribute the relief efforts.</p>
<p>The purpose of this fundraiser is to collect donations. However, to spice things up a bit, Tumblr and HONY are teaming up to provide incentives and rewards for donating. Tumblr is throwing in some cool Tumblr gear, and HONY is providing prints and other goodies. We are covering these expenses ourselves so absolutely all money raised will be going to relief efforts.</p>
</div>
<h3>Where the Money is Going</h3>
<p>100% OF PROCEEDS will be going to the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation-- a highly respected, family-run charity which has been officially endorsed by many NYC officials. The money will immediately be used to provide much-needed resources to those areas hit hardest by the storm. Tunnel to Towers is very proud of the fact that no donations are being spent on overhead, and ALL hurricane funds are going directly to relief.  </p></div>","Our Mission

<h2>Inhabited: a clear view from the sky</h2>
<p><strong>Get an artist going! I have gallery space, I have the photos, the cards, the book is designed... It just needs to be printed!</strong></p>
<p>Check this video to know more about me and my work: </p>
<p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/29252458#at=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Gwen Velge - Light Up""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gwenvelge.com/ABOUTUS1-02.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Gwen Velge profile by Rory Gibson""/></a></p>
<p>I have been flying since I can remember; a couple years ago I decided to bring together my passion for photography and my passion for flying; I took off on a solitary trip in the West Australian bush with my camera and paraglider. The product of this is ""Inhabited : a clear view from the sky"" which brings together flight, photography and reflection on our relationship to land and space.  </p>
<p>The images immediately received positive feedback and I decided to keep going with my undertaking. I have since won a couple of awards and have been exhibited in Europe and in Australia (Perth-Melbourne). </p>
<p>I am now at a<strong> turning point</strong> where I am getting gallery space, and venues to sell my prints, cards, and my book. However, the costs to produce such an amount of prints and products such as books and cards are high. I need your help!!!</p>
<p>I am represented by <strong>Boranup Gallery</strong> (Margaret river area, WA) and I will be <strong>feature artist at Apsects in King's Park</strong> (Perth, WA) in <strong>October</strong>. I need products for both galleries! </p>
<h3>Why does the project matter other than for me being in the spotlight?</h3>
<p>As Rebecca Solnit says: </p>
<p>“Places matter. Their rules, their scale, their design include or exclude civil society, pedestrianism, equality, <span>diversity (economic or otherwise), understanding of where water and garbage goes, consumption or conser</span>vation. They map our lives.” </p>
<p>I am deeply interested in these questions which are primordial issues to be addressed in our challenging social and ecological times. I believe that the relative abstractedness and the change of viewpoint of my images trigger curiosity and subsequently reflection about the viewer's relationship to the content of the photo i.e. land. We don't all feel the same about places, a place might be source of comfort for some, while the same place may be a source of discomfort for others. This varies between individuals and between cultural groups. Gaining insight into how different people relate to land may possibly increase the variety of ways we deal with space and its resources rather than limit ourselves to one narrow perception. Let's widen our horizons by changing perspective and aknowledging other possible perceptions, and give ourselves a broad framework to define what it is we want for our country, our planet, our universe.</p>
<p>Set aside the contextual importance of the project, for me to be able to fly and to produce beautiful images that trigger reflection is a dream come true. </p>
<p>Your contribution would both <strong>help an artist set up</strong>, and <strong>support a project which resonates with today's challenges</strong>.</p>

<h3>STRETCH GOALS</h3>
<div>Thanks for all the support and especially for all the shares! It means a lot to me. As you may be able to tell, I was more than willing to put my own money into this book so I set the goal low ($500) and we more than surpassed it. Now, the one thing that is really important to me is giving a bunch of these books a good home, SO I am setting some stretch goals. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Without further stuff and things, here they are:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>GOAL:  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">50 book perks claimed   REWARD: Everyone participating in those pledges receives a free comic book sized print of me as Bikini Black Cat (below)</span>

<p>UPDATE!!</p>
<p></p>We are at 50 contributions! So here we go. Added bonus! Comic sized PG pool pic to go along with my Black Cat pool pic. There is still time to get in on this deal. These prints are only available with this campaign.<p></p>

First! About me! My name is Cara Nicole. I am also known as AZ Powergirl. I cosplay, edit comics, write and color art professionally. I am also the model for Magic: The Gathering's Emmara Tandris. 
Ok, gonna break this down real quick...Me, you, Photobook 2. Let's do this. Thirty-two pages of my cosplay extravaganza coming your way!  Stories, articles, even jokes fill this comic sized, action packed, photo book.    What We Need & What You Get
**FUNDED and off to the printer!!*** Yes you can still get books and the other perks but NO ADVERTISING can be honored as this book has already been sent to the printer.
SO, I have been working very hard on getting 'Photobook: The Sequel' done and believeyoume IT IS DONE! And I thought long and hard and instead of just selling it, I concluded it would be awesome to offer it on IndieGoGo and give you, my loving fans, an opportunity to contribute and get some special goodies AND get a new audience to experience Cara Nicole AZ Powergirl! ALSO, it will allow me to offset-print a healthy amount of copies. My goal is 3,000 copies! Yup. Sounds to me like we all win!
So here is the detail of what the funds will be used for...
1) Printing and shipping to you.
2) Well, pretty much just number 1! There are no other production costs as I have this already completed!






 The Impact
 The benefits of funding this project are huge! The first Photobook was one of the first of its kind and it was wildly successful. I sold out of the first run the very first day and I reprinted 4 times. I want to go bigger! One of my biggest goals is championing cosplay and adding to its legitimacy as a valid art form. I feel that Photobook: Part Deux, with a wide audience, will help to advance this cause. 
As the proverb goes, you vote with your wallet. If you want cosplay, support it and more of it will come!


    Risks & Challenges I've taken on a substantial investment by curating images, building the book and finding good printing. This is on top of the time and effort of having built the costumes, shooting with the photographers and editing the images.



    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't pledge at this time, you can definitely share this on social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, etc etc AND you can talk to your local comic book store about carrying it in their shelves.

starting on paper from black lines and dots to reveal a series of black and

<p></p>
<p>Printing 1.000 “Interludes”with
aproximately 170 pages, page size 23/28 cm, high
quality art paper, hardcover, English and Romanian version, with a cost of
12.000 euro.</p>

<p>Purchase of a presale copy or any

printing 1,000 books in this first limited edition. The goal amount however does not cover any of my costs for pre-productions, post-production work on the images, nor the hours of work that me and a couple of extraordinary friends have spent on graphic, video and sound  design,  editing the book and on its promotion. </p>
<p>If your eyes are more focused on

e-book version of “Interludes”.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/693682/files/20140704015729-4-_L1026045.jpg?1404464249"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>How I will use the funds:</b></p>
<p>Printing the “Interludes”, the book
seen in the video is now only a “blueprint of a score”, a mock-up. </p>
<p>The graphic and design of the book are finalized and ready to be printed using craft processes for binding and
finishing in a classical printing house. I aim to keep the classical touch of
the images given by my Leica camera. To ensure the quality of the
printing, from start to finish, I will closely supervise the production of the
book.</p>
<p><b>How I will use (hopefully) the
extra-money: </b></p>
<p>Any funds exceeding
the goal amount  will first be used to print a 30/45 cm artist signed portrait
as a gift for each artist featured in the book, as many of the artists will return
to Bucharest in 2015, for the 22<sup>nd</sup> edition of “George Enescu
Festival”, and then to frame twenty pictures of 40/60cm for an exhibition held
during 2015 festival (total of approximately 2,500 Euro). 5% of any extra-money
will be donated to support the renovation of Enescu’s
childhood home in Mihaileni, a place where Enescu loved to compose and where
he found inspiration and relaxation. The rest of the money will be used to
print more books. The box seen in the movie is optional.</p>

A music coming from gods, a music
starting on paper from black lines and dots to reveal a series of black and
white photographs of strong or sensitive personalities and intangible oddities
around a classical music show.Objectives:

Printing 1.000 “Interludes”with
aproximately 170 pages, page size 23/28 cm, high
quality art paper, hardcover, English and Romanian version, with a cost of
12.000 euro.
Contributors will be rewarded
for their support from the many offers
available.
Purchase of a presale copy or any
other offer from the perk list will help to fund the production cost of
printing 1,000 books in this first limited edition. The goal amount however does not cover any of my costs for pre-productions, post-production work on the images, nor the hours of work that me and a couple of extraordinary friends have spent on graphic, video and sound  design,  editing the book and on its promotion. 
If your eyes are more focused on
e-books than in a classical browsing approach, you are invited to bid for an
e-book version of “Interludes”.How I will use the funds:
Printing the “Interludes”, the book
seen in the video is now only a “blueprint of a score”, a mock-up. 
The graphic and design of the book are finalized and ready to be printed using craft processes for binding and
finishing in a classical printing house. I aim to keep the classical touch of
the images given by my Leica camera. To ensure the quality of the
printing, from start to finish, I will closely supervise the production of the
book.
How I will use (hopefully) the
extra-money: 
Any funds exceeding
the goal amount  will first be used to print a 30/45 cm artist signed portrait
as a gift for each artist featured in the book, as many of the artists will return
to Bucharest in 2015, for the 22nd edition of “George Enescu
Festival”, and then to frame twenty pictures of 40/60cm for an exhibition held
during 2015 festival (total of approximately 2,500 Euro). 5% of any extra-money
will be donated to support the renovation of Enescu’s
childhood home in Mihaileni, a place where Enescu loved to compose and where
he found inspiration and relaxation. The rest of the money will be used to
print more books. The box seen in the movie is optional.

Please join this crowd funding campaign for the opportunity to connect
the worlds of music and photography and to produce “Interludes”! 
Please spread the word! Please e-mail “Interludes” campaign to a few people who love the
artists and their music and would be interested in this book. As well, post
this campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Blog pages. Spreading
the word is really important!
Please note: Prices for the book are discounted during the
campaign. Please add 5 Euro for Bucharest, 10 Euro for rest of Romania,  20 Euro for Europe and 35 Euro for
outside the Europe for postage and packing costs.

Thank you!",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, I’m Wes Lynch, creator of MyPictureDay. Having worked as a lead at the Boeing photo lab for 23 years—and doing youth sports photography on the side—I can see that with today’s smart phone it’s time to change the way we do picture day. I love photography and the precious memories that every photo holds, but it doesn’t need to be so expensive. In the photo lab, I provided prints that had a nice background, but what was missing was the ability to add personalized writings to the prints. To do so would be just too time consuming, which would impact the photo lab’s bottom line. </p>
<p>With the MyPictureDay app that all changes. You get to make picture day happen in your own way. We help you compose your shot, create a photo package, and add your personalized writing and quotes. We do the prints and have them to you in about week. </p>
<p>All we need to get up and running is the commercial grade printing equipment. Even though we’re smart with our money, these machine aren’t cheap! We plan to buy professional inkjet printers from Fuji. The dyes in inkjet prints can last up to 200 years, enabling your memories to endure for generations. Your contributions will help make this a reality. Imagine families saving money on their pictures,  especially when it’s already expensive to enter a child in a sports program. Registration fees, uniforms, equipment, and traveling to games—it adds up fast. Think of the families that never can afford to pay for the overpriced photography. With MyPictureDay, now they will! It’s time to disrupt the professional youth sports photography industry. You can help by contributing to this campaign. </p>
<p>Our regular prices are as follows: $2.49 for 5x7, $4.49 for 8x10. However, by contributing to our campaign, you will enjoy these prices slashed by 51%. In turn, your contributions will help us purchase four Fujifilm Frontier-S DX100 photo printers, along with high quality photo paper and ink. These printers are simple to operate, which will allow us to adapt quickly to the needs of our growing customer base.</p>
<p>Reward time ;-) We want to thank you with big savings! At the time $25 level you get (10) 5x7 and (6) 8x10 prints. And as a continued thank you, you’ll get 5% off ALL future purchases. Use this at anytime. At the $50 level we double the offering with (20) 5x7 and (12) 8x10 prints. And we double the lifetime future discount as well, giving you a commendable 10% off all future purchases. And our Grand Slam level: A $100 donation will quadruple our initial offering, giving you (40!) 5x7 and (24) 8x10 prints.

</div></div>","Hi, I’m Wes Lynch, creator of MyPictureDay. Having worked as a lead at the Boeing photo lab for 23 years—and doing youth sports photography on the side—I can see that with today’s smart phone it’s time to change the way we do picture day. I love photography and the precious memories that every photo holds, but it doesn’t need to be so expensive. In the photo lab, I provided prints that had a nice background, but what was missing was the ability to add personalized writings to the prints. To do so would be just too time consuming, which would impact the photo lab’s bottom line. 
With the MyPictureDay app that all changes. You get to make picture day happen in your own way. We help you compose your shot, create a photo package, and add your personalized writing and quotes. We do the prints and have them to you in about week. 
All we need to get up and running is the commercial grade printing equipment. Even though we’re smart with our money, these machine aren’t cheap! We plan to buy professional inkjet printers from Fuji. The dyes in inkjet prints can last up to 200 years, enabling your memories to endure for generations. Your contributions will help make this a reality. Imagine families saving money on their pictures,  especially when it’s already expensive to enter a child in a sports program. Registration fees, uniforms, equipment, and traveling to games—it adds up fast. Think of the families that never can afford to pay for the overpriced photography. With MyPictureDay, now they will! It’s time to disrupt the professional youth sports photography industry. You can help by contributing to this campaign. 
Our regular prices are as follows: $2.49 for 5x7, $4.49 for 8x10. However, by contributing to our campaign, you will enjoy these prices slashed by 51%. In turn, your contributions will help us purchase four Fujifilm Frontier-S DX100 photo printers, along with high quality photo paper and ink. These printers are simple to operate, which will allow us to adapt quickly to the needs of our growing customer base.
Reward time ;-) We want to thank you with big savings! At the time $25 level you get (10) 5x7 and (6) 8x10 prints. And as a continued thank you, you’ll get 5% off ALL future purchases. Use this at anytime. At the $50 level we double the offering with (20) 5x7 and (12) 8x10 prints. And we double the lifetime future discount as well, giving you a commendable 10% off all future purchases. And our Grand Slam level: A $100 donation will quadruple our initial offering, giving you (40!) 5x7 and (24) 8x10 prints. Of course, we’ve saved the biggest discount for last, coming in at a whopping 20% (I’d choose this one!) Don’t forget that each one of our rewards contains the same incredible benefit—lifetime use, unlimited number of orders.
What if we don’t get fully funded? We’ll buy as many printers as we can afford, and we’ll get right to work! We think our future is bright, and we’re always working hard to grow our business!

<p><b>7 pictures in 7 days. One week project, a creative photo
competition in Hemsedal, Norway.</b></p>
<p>The best photographers within ski and snowboard in the
northern scene get together to create an exhibition in 7 days. Every
photographer will bring a team of three awesome skiers or snowboarders. They
have 5 days to get the pictures they need, and on the 7<sup>th</sup> day
it’s time to print and get it up on the wall. The competition and party begins.</p>
<p>One week project has been a huge success two years in a row,
and we would love to continue this tradition. This is a nonprofit event hosted
by Mari Söderholm, Kalle Hägglund and Anki Grøthe. All three of us are creativethat live and work in Hallingdal. Our vision is
that OWP (one week project) exists to bring photography forward for the
photographer and the viewers. </p>
<p>And we are proud to say that this competition is not an
online voting event. The cool part is that you get out there, attend the event,
you have a good time with your friends and vote for your favorite picture.</p><p>----------</p>
<p><b><i>New</i></b><b> this year</b> is
that we will have a jury of 3 fine photo experts to judge which photographer will win the OWP 2016. They will carefully examine all their work. Their ruling
will be based on creativity, trick, composition, light, color, the story and of
course the finished layout on the wall.</p>
<p>So we have both the jury that crowns the winner, on all 7
pictures. And the audience (you) crowns the best picture. There are two prizes
this year! </p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>The founding we need goes to three posts.</p>
<p>1.  Prints
on kapa. This is the most expensive post. And until today the photographers
have paid their own prints. New this year is that we would have them mounted
on kapa plates. It will give the exhibition a long-lasting and nicer
finish. </p>
<p>2.  Payment
to a jury. Behind all the fun and games. In the end there will be only one
winner. To pick one winner out of 10 awesome photographers is not easy. That is
why we want the best jury possible. A team of photo-experts and photo-editors
with a lot of experience.</p>
<p>3.  Winner
takes it all. We would love to send the winner home with a bag of not just
great pictures and happy memories. But some well earned cash as well.</p>
<p>Help us make OWP the best it can be. Every krone/dollar
matters. If you can’t support us with money. Please help us share this site to
all your friends and family. Get the word out there. Hopefully we will reach
our goal.</p>
<p>In return we offer the best event of the season. Free of
cover charge for everyone that wants to join us. Write down OWP Hemsedal Café
in your calendar on the 6<sup>th</sup> of
February 2016. It’s been full house two years in a row now. With a kick-ass DJ,
the dance floor will be hot, and you might even make a new friend under your
favorites picture. </p>
<p>If for some reason you have something else to do on Saturday
the 6th. The exhibition will be open everyday for a month.</p>
<p>If you can countribuate here on Indiegogo.com we will give back
by a fun lottery for every contributor. Some lucky people will get a signed
print in the mail from the OWP 2016 collection! </p>

<p><strong>Shutter Hub is a UK-based photography organisation providing opportunities, support and networking for creative photographers worldwide. We have around 1000 members and are regularly invited to partner with major organisations such as the London Art Fair, Format Photography Festival, World Photography Association and Foam Fotografiemuseum in Amsterdam. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As part of London Photomonth 7 October – 1 November 2016 we held an exibition, Girl Town, celebrating the culture of the female in the 21st century, curated by Shutter Hub and the Old Girls Club and exhibited at St Margaret’s House in Bethnal Green. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Girl Town came together through an open call promoted by Shutter Hub and The Old Girls Club, which invited participants to enter up to 5 images via Instagram using the hashtag #girltownPM and the images were captured and printed directly from Instagram, with support from Metro Imaging. Using social media in this way created opportunities for a wide range of photographers with varied practices to get involved (at no cost to them at all) and resulted in a diverse and challenging display.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The exhibition was hugely popular and very well received by thousands of viewers, and the acclaimed Whitechapel gallery featured it in their top 5 exhibitions to see that month. A series of talks, discussions and screenings were held throughout the duration of the exhibition and included speakers from The Guardian, Wall Street Journal, Photovoice and the Director of Photomonth East London.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have been invited to show the ""Girl Town""'exhibition at  Alfred Gallery in Tel Aviv for 1 month from 14 October, which is a fantastic opportunity for all the photographers involved as well as creating an exciting and important ongoing cultural exchange.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our intention is for members of the Shutter Hub team (2 of us, volunteering, both females working in the photographic industry) to travel to Tel Aviv to install and launch the exhibition and document our experiences, for which we have had interest from national and international press.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Metro Imaging are generously providing prints of the images for display, but we are looking for support to cover travel, accommodation and basic supplies for the volunteers facilitating the exhibition installation and events in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are asking for whatever we can raise to contribute towards covering these costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Complete financial breakdown, based on 2 volunteers :</p>
<p> - Travel - flights: £1300</p>
<p> - Travel - transfers etc.: £300</p>
<p> - Air B&amp;B: £600</p>
<p> - Basic groceries: £100</p>
<p> - Flyers/invites: £140</p>
<p> - Exhibition sundries: £80</p>
<p> - Private view: £250</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If there are any additional funds after covering all essential costs we will put them towards further promotional materials for the exhibition and extending the reach of the project and discussion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone who has contributed and donated will be thanked on the Shutter Hub blog and on a printed list of supporters which will be displayed with the exhibition - please let us know if you would prefer to remain anonymous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to technical difficulties this campaign was moved from BackHer to Indiegogo, but we will honour our commitment to donate $1 per $100 raised to the Rise Together Fund as promised in our original campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about our project - we do hope you might consider supporting us in this opportunity and would be grateful if you could share our campaign!</p>

Using social media in this way created opportunities for a wide range of photographers with varied practices to get involved (at no cost to them at all) and resulted in a diverse and challenging display.
 
The exhibition was hugely popular and very well received by thousands of viewers, and the acclaimed Whitechapel gallery featured it in their top 5 exhibitions to see that month. A series of talks, discussions and screenings were held throughout the duration of the exhibition and included speakers from The Guardian, Wall Street Journal, Photovoice and the Director of Photomonth East London.
 
We have been invited to show the ""Girl Town""'exhibition at  Alfred Gallery in Tel Aviv for 1 month from 14 October, which is a fantastic opportunity for all the photographers involved as well as creating an exciting and important ongoing cultural exchange.
 
Our intention is for members of the Shutter Hub team (2 of us, volunteering, both females working in the photographic industry) to travel to Tel Aviv to install and launch the exhibition and document our experiences, for which we have had interest from national and international press.
 
Metro Imaging are generously providing prints of the images for display, but we are looking for support to cover travel, accommodation and basic supplies for the volunteers facilitating the exhibition installation and events in Tel Aviv.
 
We are asking for whatever we can raise to contribute towards covering these costs.
 
Complete financial breakdown, based on 2 volunteers :
 - Travel - flights: £1300
 - Travel - transfers etc.: £300
 - Air B&B: £600
 - Basic groceries: £100
 - Flyers/invites: £140
 - Exhibition sundries: £80
 - Private view: £250
 
If there are any additional funds after covering all essential costs we will put them towards further promotional materials for the exhibition and extending the reach of the project and discussion.
 
Everyone who has contributed and donated will be thanked on the Shutter Hub blog and on a printed list of supporters which will be displayed with the exhibition - please let us know if you would prefer to remain anonymous.
 
Due to technical difficulties this campaign was moved from BackHer to Indiegogo, but we will honour our commitment to donate $1 per $100 raised to the Rise Together Fund as promised in our original campaign.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read about our project - we do hope you might consider supporting us in this opportunity and would be grateful if you could share our campaign!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Over the years, I have traveled across North and Central America documenting people, cultures, and history, collecting stories and life lessons along the way. But documentary photography is only one aspect of my work. Another, larger part is my work with models, portraying not just their beauty but also their personalities, working to convey the true essence of these women, presenting them as individuals and not just as pretty faces. Now I want to take all of the knowledge and skills I’ve accumulated and head to Europe. But to do that, I need your help.</span></p>

I've spent a lifetime studying European history and am clearly aware of the enormity of visiting and photographing these culturally rich areas. More importantly, after much work, back-scratching, and favor-calling, I have already arranged to work with several talented models in the areas we will be visiting.</span></p>

<p> </p></div>","As a small town, self-taught photographer, I have always enjoyed telling stories through my work. Over the years, I have traveled across North and Central America documenting people, cultures, and history, collecting stories and life lessons along the way. But documentary photography is only one aspect of my work. Another, larger part is my work with models, portraying not just their beauty but also their personalities, working to convey the true essence of these women, presenting them as individuals and not just as pretty faces. Now I want to take all of the knowledge and skills I’ve accumulated and head to Europe. But to do that, I need your help.
With only my trusted friend Lola Agnosia coming along as a skilled and reliable assistant, the ultimate goal is not only to capture creative and beautiful images in some of the most magical locations in the world, but make a book offering a complete chronicle of our daily discoveries, hilarity, and setbacks that all trips of this kind involve. I've spent a lifetime studying European history and am clearly aware of the enormity of visiting and photographing these culturally rich areas. More importantly, after much work, back-scratching, and favor-calling, I have already arranged to work with several talented models in the areas we will be visiting.
SPONSORS-ONLY BLOG and PERKS
Every contributor at every level of donation will have access to the online day-to-day diary of the trip. This sponsors-only blog will include photos and videos documenting everything, from our preparations and behind-the-scenes events to finished images and even pages from my personal journal. As perks for your support I am offering everything I can, including signed prints, personal handmade photo booklets, life drawings I have done of some of my favorite models, your own personal photo shoot, and so much more. Look closely for the perks you like best!

Sero being short for serotonin – the chemical believed to contribute to the feeling of happiness.

We call them Sero Stories!</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>THE PLAN</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Spring 2016, John and Tracy embark across North-America in their 1991 Westfalia camper van to find and share the most inspiring Sero Stories. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445783027/ukzsmtguyuzgj7ydgbqa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>THE GOAL</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>We want to shine some light on mental wellness and suicide prevention</b>. If we can motivate just one person to seek help and begin their journey down<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the road to recovery the project will be a success. Suicide has more than one victim. Friends and family also suffer when one chooses to take their own life. So let's talk about it. Let's make the changes we need in our lives to be mentally well.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Once the project has ended, a selection of our best stories and photos will be collected in a coffee table book in hopes that the conversation about mental wellness will continue on. Proceeds from book sales will be <b>donated to mental health awareness and suicide prevention charities</b>.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>WHY WE ARE DOING IT?</strong></h2>

<li style=""text-align: left;"">
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Happiness</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">:</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> It's what our ultimate goal should be. But that goal often gets challenged by social norms for a stable career, wealth and consumerism. Let's get back to the basics and strive towards a life filled with well-being and mental heath. What better way to do this than to return to the outdoors to play again?</span>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Community</b>: Searching For Sero just isn't about the stories we are telling. It's about community and sharing all of your #FoundSero moments. What is a #FoundSero moment you ask? It's your happy place, rather it's on top a mountain, the edge of a waterfall or sleeping on dirt. Everyone has a happy place. What's yours?</span></li>
<li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>A Movement</b>: We don't want to make this just another road trip, we want to make Searching For Sero a movement!

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">John is an <a href=""http://www.johnrathwellphotography.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">internationally published and acclaimed action sports photographer</a>. He has been commissioned by Red Bull, Outside Magazine, and The Enthusiast Network over the last several years, just to name a few.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">John’s <b>motivation for this project came after his father passed away in 2014 from suicide</b>. His father focused his life on working long hours, overtime and any shift he could take. John watched his father's lifestyle as he grew up and could see that life needed to be more balanced. Throughout the project, John is hoping to motivate people to put a little more focus on outdoor adventure and hobbies that bring happiness to their lives by sharing the stories and photographs of how others live theirs. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i2.wp.com/www.searchingforsero.com/wp-content/plugins/advanced-wp-columns/assets/js/plugins/views/img/1x1-pixel.png?zoom=2&amp;w=1032"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tracy is a traditional 9 to 5 worker. She has years of experience working in criminology and youth intervention as well as business organizational analysis. People’s life choices and behaviours have always intrigued her.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Her interest in Searching for Sero comes from the desire to dig in and understand the human-being in the choices they make. She hopes to grasp these people’s relationship to happiness and how they can play an active role in their own mental wellness. What is worth living for? Life! Life is worth living for and Tracy wants to find out more about the inspiring stories of these people and their passions, share them, and prove that the feeling of amazement still exists.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Rain Dog</strong></h3>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A road trip isn’t complete without a furry, four-legged friend. Rain is a beagle/lab mix with an obsession with playing fetch. I guess you could say, chasing tennis balls are her Sero moments.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rain’s role on the trip is navigation and security. Her strong sense of smell should lead us in the right direction. We will also rely on her experience as a veteran traveler - this hound has already been across Canada and the U.S.A. on two separate journeys. Her ability to chase squirrels will also play a key part in the project… we just aren’t sure how yet.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you get the chance to meet Rain, remember that if you toss the ball once, it will never end. She will play fetch forever and never seems to get tired.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When we decided to hit the road, we knew that there was only one van for the job, the Volkswagen Vanagon Westfalia Camper. Why a Westy? It offered us the best compromise to living space and fuel economy. We could never afford to fuel a big RV around North America, but we needed a little more living space than a Toyota Yaris. What we ended up with is a beautiful 1991 Westfalia. She has 360,000km on her, but the 2.1 litre engine has already been replaced. Top that off with new mechanical parts, rack system, solar system, a fresh paint job, <a href=""http://www.gowesty.com/ec_view_details.php?id=23849"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lift kit, and all-terrain tires</a> and it makes for a pretty ideal adventure mobile.</p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>","Searching for Sero is a mental wellness project created by professional photographer, John Rathwell and writer, Tracy Guenard. Sero being short for serotonin – the chemical believed to contribute to the feeling of happiness. The photo project will share the stories of people who are passionate about outdoor adventure as the key to happiness, well-being and balance in their lives. We call them Sero Stories! 

THE PLAN
Spring 2016, John and Tracy embark across North-America in their 1991 Westfalia camper van to find and share the most inspiring Sero Stories. 

THE GOAL
We want to shine some light on mental wellness and suicide prevention. If we can motivate just one person to seek help and begin their journey down the road to recovery the project will be a success. Suicide has more than one victim. Friends and family also suffer when one chooses to take their own life. So let's talk about it. Let's make the changes we need in our lives to be mentally well.
Once the project has ended, a selection of our best stories and photos will be collected in a coffee table book in hopes that the conversation about mental wellness will continue on. Proceeds from book sales will be donated to mental health awareness and suicide prevention charities.
WHY WE ARE DOING IT?


Happiness: It's what our ultimate goal should be. But that goal often gets challenged by social norms for a stable career, wealth and consumerism. Let's get back to the basics and strive towards a life filled with well-being and mental heath. What better way to do this than to return to the outdoors to play again?

Community: Searching For Sero just isn't about the stories we are telling. It's about community and sharing all of your #FoundSero moments. What is a #FoundSero moment you ask? It's your happy place, rather it's on top a mountain, the edge of a waterfall or sleeping on dirt. Everyone has a happy place. What's yours?
A Movement: We don't want to make this just another road trip, we want to make Searching For Sero a movement! We want to motivate and inspire people and ourselves. We want to encourage and create. Help us start the movement and keep it rolling by sharing and reflecting on all your #FoundSero moments.

WHAT YOU WILL HELP CREATE?


Sero Stories: Every week, a new Sero Story will be published featuring an inspiring person who has enriched their life with sport and outdoor adventure completed with set of about 20 amazing photographs by John Rathwell. Take a look at the stories posted so far. 

Blog:  A weekly blog post will also be posted on the website. As we travel North-America and live the van life, we want to share our own experiences, both the good and bad. Blog post topics will touch on a variety of subjects: van life, adventures, guest posts, behind the scenes or creative collaborations. You can already read some here!


Social Media: We want to create enriching content on all forms of social media so fans can keep in touch with us throughout the entire project. Find and follow us on; Facebook, Instagram (@SearchingForSero), Snapchat (@Searching4Sero)  and Twitter (@Searching4Sero)

Newsletter: A monthly issue of our e-newsletter will be sent to subscribers and will be comprised of a recap of the best moments, stories and photos of the month. Don't miss a single moment, sign up here!

Français: Although this crowd funding campaign is in English only, our website and all its content is fully bilingual. Que votre langue de prédilection soit l'anglais ou le français, vous serez servi!


WHO ARE WE?


John Rathwell

John is an internationally published and acclaimed action sports photographer. He has been commissioned by Red Bull, Outside Magazine, and The Enthusiast Network over the last several years, just to name a few.
John’s motivation for this project came after his father passed away in 2014 from suicide. His father focused his life on working long hours, overtime and any shift he could take. John watched his father's lifestyle as he grew up and could see that life needed to be more balanced. Throughout the project, John is hoping to motivate people to put a little more focus on outdoor adventure and hobbies that bring happiness to their lives by sharing the stories and photographs of how others live theirs. 
Tracy Guenard

Tracy is a traditional 9 to 5 worker. She has years of experience working in criminology and youth intervention as well as business organizational analysis. People’s life choices and behaviours have always intrigued her.
Her interest in Searching for Sero comes from the desire to dig in and understand the human-being in the choices they make. She hopes to grasp these people’s relationship to happiness and how they can play an active role in their own mental wellness. What is worth living for? Life! Life is worth living for and Tracy wants to find out more about the inspiring stories of these people and their passions, share them, and prove that the feeling of amazement still exists.
Rain Dog

A road trip isn’t complete without a furry, four-legged friend. Rain is a beagle/lab mix with an obsession with playing fetch. I guess you could say, chasing tennis balls are her Sero moments.
Rain’s role on the trip is navigation and security. Her strong sense of smell should lead us in the right direction. We will also rely on her experience as a veteran traveler - this hound has already been across Canada and the U.S.A. on two separate journeys. Her ability to chase squirrels will also play a key part in the project… we just aren’t sure how yet.
If you get the chance to meet Rain, remember that if you toss the ball once, it will never end. She will play fetch forever and never seems to get tired.
The Van

When we decided to hit the road, we knew that there was only one van for the job, the Volkswagen Vanagon Westfalia Camper. Why a Westy? It offered us the best compromise to living space and fuel economy. We could never afford to fuel a big RV around North America, but we needed a little more living space than a Toyota Yaris. What we ended up with is a beautiful 1991 Westfalia. She has 360,000km on her, but the 2.1 litre engine has already been replaced. Top that off with new mechanical parts, rack system, solar system, a fresh paint job, lift kit, and all-terrain tires and it makes for a pretty ideal adventure mobile.

BUDGET
We need your help to hit the road. The van has already been purchased and we are working on the restoration (with the help of GoWesty and Diesel Rover). We just need you to put gas in the tank! 
Expenses So Far 

1991 VW Westfalia: $9,600
Van repairs and Restorations: $10,500
SUB TOTAL: $20,100

Budget For The Road (One Year) 


Fuel: $10,000
Food (Human and Dog): $9,000
Van Repairs/Maintenance: $3,600
Camping Fees/Park Passes: $2,600
Insurance: $1,200
SUB TOTAL: $26,400

TOTAL FOR 2 YEARS PLUS EXPENSES SO FAR: $72,900


We realize that the cost of our project sounds ridiculously high, but it is the reality of what things cost these days. We will be living as frugal as possible on the road and we believe our planned budget is worst case scenario. Also, we know we will be investing a lot of our own savings into the project, and we are okay with that. We are not asking you to fund the entire budget, but anything helps and will be put to good use! If we do not meet our funding objective, we will still go forth with the project but on a reduced scale. We just need your help to make it epic!

One big wave of immigration occurred directly after World War Two. Arriving on boats from all parts of Europe, people looked to escape devastation, poverty, and turmoil in a land with few conflicts and many opportunities.</span></p><p>Italian immigrants, like others from Ukraine, Poland, and many other countries, arrived in Toronto at this time and were quickly confronted by a city where customs, language, and climate were different than their own.

The studio setting is an important element for the project. The gray walls of the studio backdrop erase anything that would distract from the subjects' appearance, allowing the viewer to focus in on the uniqueness of their facial expressions, from the wrinkles in their faces, the fabric of their clothing, details on stitching, and especially important details of their hands, such as lines and callouses.

In other photos the subjects are given breathing space, allowing the viewer to notice the subject’s clothing detail, animation and stance. I imagine the pages of the book to be printed with matte paper which has a soft, tactile quality that I believe showcases the black and white photos well. The images have texture and detail so I think it’s important that that paper mirror that quality, and echo the theme of hands.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557784774/ipi8nqnm83rd1gs4zd9t.jpg"" src=""""/></p></div>","About the bookWaves of immigration and its rich indigenous history make Toronto the most diverse city in the world. One big wave of immigration occurred directly after World War Two. Arriving on boats from all parts of Europe, people looked to escape devastation, poverty, and turmoil in a land with few conflicts and many opportunities.Italian immigrants, like others from Ukraine, Poland, and many other countries, arrived in Toronto at this time and were quickly confronted by a city where customs, language, and climate were different than their own. St. Clair West was a place to seek refuge in the familiar. More specifically, Tre Mari Bakery on St. Clair at Dufferin, a business owned and operated by my family since the 1950s, became a place for people to hear Italian sounds, eat Italian foods, and feel the warmth of the country and people they left behind.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Symbiosis is a photography exhibition organised by the Hexagon Collective from Edinburgh Napier University. We are seven young photographers from seven different countries and we are extremely excited about our first self-organised exhibition. Although our fields of interest differ in terms of genres and techniques explored, this exhibition gives us the chance to come together and thematically focus on the connection between our interests.</p>
<p>Symbiosis - A Photography Exhibition focuses on the interaction between two beings, and how that codependence affects their perception of themselves. The exhibition will explore these symbiotic connections through a variety of genres ranging from landscape, portraiture and still life photography. Each photographer will approach the theme of the exhibition from different angles, turning their lens on the natural symbiosis between two entities as well as focusing on a more conceptual notion of symbiosis as the way in which an individual interacts with their body or their familiar bondings. </p>
<p>The funds donated will be used to finance the production of the exhibition.</p> <p>The exhibition will be held at Whitespace in Edinburgh, Scotland on 17.-23. March 2017. Free admission.</p> <p>Members of Hexagon Collective:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise £950 for costs related to the production of the exhibition. We have estimated personal costs for printing, mounting and framing, and shared costs such as graphic design, printing of posters and leaflets, and miscellaneous costs like fuel and hanging materials. Previous to the campaign have received a small grant through our university, and that helps us cover the cost of space. The more we raise, the more we get to use for the work itself.</p>
<p><br/>The perks you get will be made for you. Instead of sending you a print that is one of a thousand, we print it for you according to your wishes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In this digital age we are used to looking at photographs on the screen. Our phones, our computers, our tablets. It is quite something to print a photograph on quality paper, and to put it on a wall. There is something exciting about making small prints and flipping through them in your hands or spreading them on a table. What we are about to do is a step further: a gallery space, full bodies of work and an official opening. We get to explore a challenging topic and interpret it each in our own way, produce the work and to show it to people. We are unspeakably excited about this, and we would love you to be a part of it as well! </p>
<p>Come to the opening night to meet us and discuss the work with other photography-lovers. Come some other day, when it’s calm and you get to look at the work for as long as you want. Contribute to the campaign and help us make it happen. Receive prints or a postcard and experience what we are so excited about!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have a secure exhibition space and a week to exhibit. Now it is up to getting the work on a physical surface (printing) and getting some eyes on it (advertising)! So technically we have an exhibition and without any major disasters (hard drive problems or destruction of film) everybody’s work will make it on the wall! All that is left now is making the experience as good as possible for everybody visiting the exhibition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to any financial support, you can also help support our campaign by spreading the word. Talk to the people around you, follow us on Facebook and Instagram, share our posts and Indiegogo page! We appreciate all the love.</p>
</div><p><br/>Also, come to the exhibition! We would love to see you face-to-face. The opening night is at 6pm on Friday the 17th March! Bring all your photography-loving friends.</p></div>","Short Summary
Symbiosis is a photography exhibition organised by the Hexagon Collective from Edinburgh Napier University. We are seven young photographers from seven different countries and we are extremely excited about our first self-organised exhibition. Although our fields of interest differ in terms of genres and techniques explored, this exhibition gives us the chance to come together and thematically focus on the connection between our interests.
Symbiosis - A Photography Exhibition focuses on the interaction between two beings, and how that codependence affects their perception of themselves. The exhibition will explore these symbiotic connections through a variety of genres ranging from landscape, portraiture and still life photography. Each photographer will approach the theme of the exhibition from different angles, turning their lens on the natural symbiosis between two entities as well as focusing on a more conceptual notion of symbiosis as the way in which an individual interacts with their body or their familiar bondings. 
The funds donated will be used to finance the production of the exhibition. The exhibition will be held at Whitespace in Edinburgh, Scotland on 17.-23. March 2017. Free admission. Members of Hexagon Collective:

<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>Hi – I am Philippe Braquenier, a documentary photographer from Belgium. I have spent the past five years traveling around Europe and beyond shooting photos for my project ‘’Palimpsest’’. From the Swiss CERN institute to the index cards of the age-old Mundaneum museum and Wikileaks, “Palimpsest” explores the makeup of the conceptual and physical landscape of Western cultural knowledge and heritage: how does contemporaneity assert itself from the penumbra of history? The primary task of the book is not so much to explain the past as it is to consider historical development and its visual expressions. Using photography, text and Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) as its means of investigation, the publication emerges from the intersections of science and culture, natural and man-made, analogue and digital, visible and hidden. On its pages, History and present converge through these seeming polarities and propose a persuasive argument to refigure temporality.</p>
<p>‘’Palimpsest’’ is an ongoing project that began in 02012 and like any ‘living’ archive, it keeps growing constantly. Approaching the book as a work-in-progress, I debunk the publication, and the idea of history itself, as inactive and immobile. The work illustrates how material history is constantly being altered and added on. It questions the methods mankind uses to preserve historical records — and knowledge overall.</p>
<p>Designed by 6’56’’, the book will be published by Art Paper Editions and printed in Belgium. The publication is designed as an archive of approximately 60 sheets and allows self-edit possibilities with the help of the UDC. UDC is the world's foremost multilingual classification scheme for all  fields of knowledge and a sophisticated indexing and retrieval tool. It is a highly flexible classification system for all kinds of information in any medium. In this publication, UDC is used to organise the theme of the image, its place and its date. In the same way, the cardboard used for the cover is acid free to preserve the book for the future in the best condition.</p>
<p>This crowdfunding campaign is going to support the production costs associated with the book, which includes printing, design and writing.</p>
<p>If we don’t hit our target then the publication just simply won’t exist. So please consider supporting the campaign by ordering a copy, picking up one of the rewards or sharing amongst your networks.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello! This is the fundraising page for the second fundraising stage for the <em>Breaking All The Rules</em> cosplay photobook project. The first round was a great success, with more than $3,000 raised. With that money, I've been able to interview and photograph cosplayers at Kumoricon 2012 and Nan Desu Kan 2012, and will be using the rest of the money to photograph even more cosplayers at Anime Matsuri 2013, Anime Central 2013, Metrocon 2013, Anime Expo 2013, and Dragon*Con 2013.</p>
<p>Although these are a varied number of conventions, there's definitely a big chunk of the United States missing in the cons I listed above, and that's the western US. The states of New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, the Dakotas, and even Kansas and Missouri have many talented cosplayers and I want to showcase them in the book. However, I don't have the funds to make it out there at this point. Donating to this second stage fundraiser will enable me to take a trip out to the west and include this region in the project.</p>
<p>At this point, I am hoping to attend AniMegaCon in Las Vegas (June 14-16) and SoDakCon in South Dakota (June 21-23), as well as perhaps another convention in the western Midwest. I would also like to make it out to Arizona and New Mexico and the more northern states. Cosplayers there may be more scattered, so I may have to take this last leg as a roadtrip and schedule meetings with cosplayers along the way. All of this will cost some money, and this is where I hope you can help!</p>

<p>Thank you for all your continuing support. I'm already so grateful for all the help I've been given, from donations to the first fundraiser, to people spreading the word, to all those who have liked the Facebook page, and definitely to the cosplayers who have agreed to let me talk to them and photograph them for the project.

<p>Costume Play - a Japanese word originally coined describe the hobby of designing and dressing up in costumes. While that may bring up images of Halloween, costume players - or ""cosplayers"" - now go all out with painstakingly accurate replicas of their favorite costumes from TV shows, cartoons, comics, and movies. Cosplay has moved from a niche corner of Japanese geekdom to a global pop culture phenomenon that includes the United States.</p>

<p><em>Breaking All the Rules</em> is a photobook that showcases the people behind the costumes. Cosplay is a hobby that breaks all the rules: anyone of any size, any race, any age, any gender, any background, can cosplay. For the past year, I've been traveling around the East Coast taking photos of cosplayers in costume and asking them why they're so in love with this hobby and the culture around it. I'd like to expand my travels to the rest of the country and interview cosplayers around the United States about their personal cosplay stories, and discover more about the history behind cosplaying and fan conventions.</p>
<p>This book will be a compliation of all those photographs and interviews, showcasing cosplayers in their own words. I don't have the money to make this book happen on my own, but thanks to Indiegogo, I want to make this project a reality.</p>

<p>This is a book for cosplayers, people who love cosplayers, and also those asking what cosplay is. While it may seem strange to express oneself through a costume designed for a fictional character, those characters are the most important part. People's lives are changed by stories, factual or fictional, every day. Those characters in those stories - the characters who they cosplay - have helped people discover new, different parts of themselves. Cosplay is the ultimate tribute, to say that yes, my outlook, my friendships, and my life have forever changed because of this story.<br/><br/> In this book, I'm sharing the new stories that have come about because of these tributes. The cosplayers I'm photographing and interviewing are everyday, ordinary people. They're students, waitresses, software engineers, musicians, chemists, retail assistants, and managers who, several times a year, put on a costume and become outlaws, fallen villains, ingenues, femme fatales, knights, and heroes starting out on their journeys. They are all extraordinary.<br/><br/>Even in the United States there are many hundreds of thousands of cosplayers, more than I could ever fit into a single book. But I hope this book is a beginning. I hope it can start dialogues between people, no matter how diverse their backgrounds. When asked, ""why do you cosplay?"" I hope someone can flip through the pages of this book and point to the cosplayers describing in their own words how cosplay has profoundly changed them and made their world a better place.</p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm a cosplayer and photographer from Boston, MA. I started cosplaying in 2007 and attended my first convention, Anime Boston, in 2008. Being both a cosplayer and photographer has given me a unique perspective on the cosplay culture in America, and I hope to bring that to life in this book.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>You've got more questions? Here are some answers!</h1>
<p>Q: How is this book any different from other books on cosplay, like <em>Cosplay in America</em>?<br/>A: The last thing I want to do is for this book to be perceived as a threat or slight against other people who have published books on cosplay! I don't think that we should stop writing books simply because one or two have already been published on the subject - if that were the case, bookstores would be out of business! I deeply respect the authors of books like <em>Cosplay in America</em>; without people like them, cosplay wouldn't be as widespread as it is today. This book is meant more as a way for cosplayers to tell their stories in their own words. I plan to put emphasis on the interview, with the pictures as an accompaniment. I want to give a voice to cosplayers around the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What happens if the donation limit isn't reached?<br/>A: Indiegogo has a wonderful option called ""flexible funding,"" which allows me to keep the money that is raised even if the deadline passes without reaching the goal. Any money, even short of the goal, will help me at least get to AniMegaCon in Nevada.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What happens if we go over the donation limit?<br/>A: Printing a book costs so much money, as does traveling to get interviews and photos for the book! In the incredible event we go over the limit, the money will be used to fund printing costs for the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How do I get featured in the book for an interview?<br/>A: All my images are from photos I've taken or will take of cosplayers mostly at different conventions around the country. Right now I'm only looking for cosplayers from the western and southern US (not including the West Coast). Not all cosplayers who I photograph will be featured, as I'm trying to represent as large a cross-section  as I can, but I'll try to fit as many in as possible. Ideally, I'd like there to be around 50 cosplayers in the book. If you're interested in having a photo of yourself in the book by donating $50 or more, please see the next question!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How does the $50 photo perk work?<br/>A: Because I can't possibly feature everyone who wants to be in the book, I'm adding in a special perk for cosplayers who I won't have the chance to interview. By donating $50 or more, you will have the option of sending one photograph of you in costume to be included in a special user-submitted photo section of the book (size tbd, minumum 2""x3"", maximum 4""x6""). The photos will include your name, your hometown, and the year you started cosplaying. Photos may be color or black&amp;white, and may be taken by anyone provided that the photographer gives permission for it to be published. Full information about this perk will be emailed to everyone after the campaign ends on April 2, 2012.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I want to donate but I see that rewards at the higher tiers are limited. Why?<br/>A: I wish I could reward every single person who wanted to donate, but unfortunately, I have to factor in costs such as shipping the reward, adding extra pages to the book for names of donors, and giving away free books, which takes away from the number of books I have to sell. If the book does well, perhaps I'll have more projects and books to give out in the future!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I want to donate, but I only have $1. Is that okay?<br/>A: Absolutely! Every dollar helps. And even if you don't have money to donate right now, you can still help by letting people know about this campaign, and what I'm trying to do with this project. Sharing the website link and Facebook link are a big help in spreading the word.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I want to donate, but I can't afford it right now.<br/>A: There are so many different ways you can still help. Share the link to this campaign with anyone you can. Find me at a con and get some business cards from me; I'll give you as many as you want to hand out! :) Like the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/BreakingAllTheRulesCosplay"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a> and tell your friends. Also, if you think you'll have some funds later after the campaign is over and still want to help, you can always visit the <a href=""http://breakingalltherules.storenvy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">store</a>.</p></div>","Hello! This is the fundraising page for the second fundraising stage for the Breaking All The Rules cosplay photobook project. The first round was a great success, with more than $3,000 raised. With that money, I've been able to interview and photograph cosplayers at Kumoricon 2012 and Nan Desu Kan 2012, and will be using the rest of the money to photograph even more cosplayers at Anime Matsuri 2013, Anime Central 2013, Metrocon 2013, Anime Expo 2013, and Dragon*Con 2013.
Although these are a varied number of conventions, there's definitely a big chunk of the United States missing in the cons I listed above, and that's the western US. The states of New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, the Dakotas, and even Kansas and Missouri have many talented cosplayers and I want to showcase them in the book. However, I don't have the funds to make it out there at this point. Donating to this second stage fundraiser will enable me to take a trip out to the west and include this region in the project.
At this point, I am hoping to attend AniMegaCon in Las Vegas (June 14-16) and SoDakCon in South Dakota (June 21-23), as well as perhaps another convention in the western Midwest. I would also like to make it out to Arizona and New Mexico and the more northern states. Cosplayers there may be more scattered, so I may have to take this last leg as a roadtrip and schedule meetings with cosplayers along the way. All of this will cost some money, and this is where I hope you can help!
If you are a western USA cosplayer from any of the states listed above, please feel free to contact me at ger.tysk@gmail.com - I'd love to interview you!

The connection I get through my lens with nature is unlike anything else in my life. If I have a busy week of work and can't get out to shoot for myself it really wears down on me. So today was an exceptionally difficult day. To help deal with some major life stress I headed back out to the spot I have been shooting at the past few weeks. Things are looking so incredible there now. The recent cold snap has created many neat ice shapes and formations. I was setting up to take a photo and that is when it happened.

<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Who are you?</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Hi there, there, over there!</p>
<p>I am Seah, a Korean expat living in the Netherlands for 3
years now. I am not a professional photographer or craft maker, but I do love
making photos and small little things for lovely people around me. Whoelse
wouldn’t, right? :-)</p>
<p>I love making photos because I believe that photography is the
most powerful means of engaging in and communicating experiences. I love
hand-crafting things for people because it makes me happy to think about how I
know them, how each of them plays a role in my life and, above all, to imagine
smiles on their faces when they see what I have made for them. </p>
<p>Throughout this year, I have made <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1649654508619210.1073741830.1380345368883460&amp;type=1&amp;l=547d998df0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sheep-themed cards</a> because
2015 is the year of sheep. Next year is the year of monkey, so I will probably
make monkey-themed cards in 2016! Around the end of last year, I made <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mongmong1220/posts/1528417394076256"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mongmong1220/posts/1528417394076256"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a 2015 calendar</a> with photos I took in Amsterdam, to share my experience of Amsterdam with my friends and family in Korea.</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>What are you doing here on Indiegogo?</b></h3><p></p>
<p>As approaching
the end of year, I was thinking which experience of this year I want to share
with others. The unforgettable experience of this year to me was a trip
to Morocco (Marrakesh and Essaouira) in July. It was my first time to visit
Arab culture-based country. Further, it has been a while to be where I can
hardly communicate with people (as the most of Dutch people speak very good
English, and Moroccan people barely speak English unless you are at luxurious
hotels or restaurants), and to feel that much heat (as I always feel cold in the
Netherlands). Of course it was not very comfortable to haggle over almost
everything with very few French phrases I know, but it was part of Moroccan
experience. I enjoyed walking around Marrakesh and Essaouira, indulging myself
into exotic feelings from a whole different colors and materials they use;
mosaics, geometric patterns and symbols everywhere with little stories
behind; the concept of humble outside with amazing interior; and Arabic hymns repeating regularly at specific times of day.<b></b></p>
<p>Therefore, this year, I decided to make a birthday/event calendar with the
photos I took in Marrakesh and Essaouira, to share my first impressions of

<p>저는 네덜란드로 건너와서 살기 시작한지 이제 3<span>년차 되는 월급쟁이입니다. 짬이 날때마다 사진을 찍고 이런저런 조그만 것들을 제 손으로 직접만들어
주변 분들께 전달하는 것을 무척이나 좋아합니다. 사진찍는 걸 좋아하는 이유는 사진이야말로 경험을 공유하고
전달하는 가장 효과적인 매개체라고 생각하기 때문이고, 자그마한 것들을 제 손으로 직접 만들어 전달하는
것을 좋아하는 이유는 이 과정에서 주변 사람들에 대해 더 깊이 생각하게 되고 아이디어를 손에 잡혀지는 것으로 만들어내는 과정을 매우 즐기며 무엇보다도
제가 만든 것을 전달할 때 받는 분들의 행복해하는 모습을 상상하면 행복해지기 때문입니다. 저는 전문 디자이너나
작가는 아니고 관련 교육을 전문적으로 받은 적도 없습니다만, 받는 사람에 대한 깊은 생각과 관찰 그리고 만드는
데 들이는 정성 만큼은 프로페셔널 못지 않다고 감히 생각해봅니다, 헤헤.</span></p>

<p>그.리.하.야. </p>
<p>올해에는
 다른 분들과 나누고 싶은 경험으로 모로코 여행을 선택하게 되었고, 그래서 마라케시와 에사우이라에서 찍은 사진들을 가지고 생일/이벤트 달력을 만들기로 마음먹게 되었습니다. 우선 시험삼아  120g Standard White Mat Paper에 1부 인쇄를 해 보았고, 250g Natural White Mat Paper에 1부 인쇄를 해 보았는데요, 저 스스로는 결과가 꽤나 마음에 들었답니다. 그래서 좋은 종이에 더 많은 부수를 인쇄해 많은 분들과 나누고자 여러분의 도움을 청하게 되었습니다!</p>

Who are you?
Hi there, there, over there!
I am Seah, a Korean expat living in the Netherlands for 3
years now. I am not a professional photographer or craft maker, but I do love
making photos and small little things for lovely people around me. Whoelse
wouldn’t, right? :-)
I love making photos because I believe that photography is the
most powerful means of engaging in and communicating experiences. I love
hand-crafting things for people because it makes me happy to think about how I
know them, how each of them plays a role in my life and, above all, to imagine
smiles on their faces when they see what I have made for them. 
Throughout this year, I have made sheep-themed cards because
2015 is the year of sheep. Next year is the year of monkey, so I will probably
make monkey-themed cards in 2016! Around the end of last year, I made a 2015 calendar with photos I took in Amsterdam, to share my experience of Amsterdam with my friends and family in Korea.
What are you doing here on Indiegogo?
As approaching
the end of year, I was thinking which experience of this year I want to share
with others. The unforgettable experience of this year to me was a trip
to Morocco (Marrakesh and Essaouira) in July. It was my first time to visit
Arab culture-based country. Further, it has been a while to be where I can
hardly communicate with people (as the most of Dutch people speak very good
English, and Moroccan people barely speak English unless you are at luxurious
hotels or restaurants), and to feel that much heat (as I always feel cold in the
Netherlands). Of course it was not very comfortable to haggle over almost
everything with very few French phrases I know, but it was part of Moroccan
experience. I enjoyed walking around Marrakesh and Essaouira, indulging myself
into exotic feelings from a whole different colors and materials they use;
mosaics, geometric patterns and symbols everywhere with little stories
behind; the concept of humble outside with amazing interior; and Arabic hymns repeating regularly at specific times of day.
Therefore, this year, I decided to make a birthday/event calendar with the
photos I took in Marrakesh and Essaouira, to share my first impressions of
Morocco. I already
printed out 2 copies of this calendar: 1 copy on 120g Standard White Mat paper and 1 copy on 250g Natural White Mat paper. In order to print more copies with good
quality papers, I need your support!*The Korean letter after the number of month is the unit of month in Korean.*the cover page of calendar
What are you going to
do with my help and what will I get in return? 
Your precious funding will be used for printing the
calendars and delivery (packaging and shipping).


The first copy with 250g Natural White Mat Paper costed me around
13,52€ excluding 20% tax and spring wire task: 13 pages (cover + 12 months) x
(0,85€ (color print fee) + 0,19€ (paper fee)).


The first copy with 120g Standard White Mat paper costed me around
11,83€ excluding 20% tax and spring wire task: 13 pages (cover+12 months) x
(0,85€ (color print fee) + 0,06€ (paper fee)).


Basic color print fee will slightly go down as the number of papers
to print increases although paper fee would remain the same. I will also look
for other printing services which could give me a better deal as the campaign goes. In addition to the printing cost, shipping to the regions outside EU would cost
me extra. So, your support will help me greatly to make this happen!If the campaign reaches the goal, you will receive the following perks. Don't forget to check the details of perks in a stand-alone perks section:


5$: a personal thank you card where 1 of photos from the calendar printed. 


10$: 120g Standard White Mat Paper Printed Calendar.


20$: 250g

30$: 250g Natural White Mat Paper Printed Calendar + 120g Standard White Mat
Paper Printed Calendar.


40$: 2 x 250g Natural White Mat Paper printed calendar.


50$: 2 x 250g Natural White Mat Paper printed calendar +
120g Standard White Mat Paper Printed Calendar.

If the campaign does not
reach the goal... If the campaign does not reach the goal unfortunately, I will use the money to send you a personal thank you card on which 1 of photos from the calendar is printed.I had to pluck up some courage to publicly ask for support for what I enjoy doing like this. I am very excited with my first Indiegogo campaign but I am nervous at the same time. However, regardless of the campaign results, I am sure that I will learn something, which is already amazing! :-)   
Thanks!

2015년에는 양의 해를 맞이하여 하얀 양 친구가 등장하는 카드들을 만들어서 지인분들께 전달했습니다. 내년은 원숭이의 해이니 아마도 원숭이 카드를 만들겠지요ㅋ 암스테르담 생활 2년차가 되어가던 작년 연말에는 제가 하루하루 살아가고 있는 암스테르담을 함께 나누고자 암스테르담에서 찍은 사진들을 가지고 2015년 달력을 만들어 한국에 있는 지인분들께 전달하였습니다. 


무얼 갖고 왔는고?


연말이 다가오면서 올해 내가 했던 경험 중 다른 분들과 공유하고 싶은 경험은 무엇이 있을까 생각해 보았습니다. 올해 가장 인상깊었던 경험은 바로 7월에 다녀온 모로코 여행이었습니다. 1주일간 마라케시와 에사우이라라는 두 도시를 방문했었는데요. 아랍문화권국가를 처음으로 방문하는 것이 었습니다. 또한 무척이나오랜만에 사람들과 좀처럼 대화가 되지 않는 환경 (대부분의 네덜란드 사람들은 영어를 훌륭히 구사하고, 모로코 사람들은 영어를 거의 안 쓰기 때문이지요), 머리위에서 작렬하는 태양으로부터 오는 뜨거운 열기 (네덜란드에서는 늘 춥다고 느끼는 저입니다)를 접했습니다. 물론, 모든 것들을 손가락에 꼽을 정도로만 기억하는 빈약한 불어로 흥정해야 하는 상황이 그리 편안하진 않았지만, 그 역시 모로코여행의 일부였습니다. 모로코에서 돌아다니는 동안 지금껏 제가 익숙해있던 환경과는 전혀 다른 색깔과 재료들에서 신선한 아름다움을느끼고, 여기저기서 쉽게 볼 수 있는 모자이크와 기하학적 문양들이 가진 저마다의 이야기에 귀를 기울이고, 겉은 매우 소박하고 단순하지만 안은 수려하고 아름답게 가꾸는 컨셉에 경탄하고, 매일매일 똑같은 시간대마다 규칙적으로 들려오는 아랍기도 소리를 들으며 그 이국적인 느낌들을 있는 힘껏 받아들이고 즐겼습니다.

White Mat Paper에 달력을 인쇄하는데 (20% 세금과 스프링으로 묶는 작업 제외) 대략 13,52€가들었습니다: 총 13페이지 (커버페이지 + 12개월) X 0,85€ (컬러인쇄 페이지당 기본비용) + 0,19€ (선택한 종이 1장당 비용).


인쇄하는 페이지 수가 늘어나도 종이  1장당 비용은 그대로 변함없지만, 컬러인쇄 페이지당 기본 비용은 조금씩 내려갑니다. 캠페인이 진행되는 동안 저 또한 제가 샘플인쇄를 진행했던곳 말고 다른 인쇄소에서 더 좋은 조건을 제시해 줄 수 있는지 알아보도록 하겠습니다. 인쇄비용에 더불어 유럽 이외의 지역으로 달력을 배송하는데에 적잖은 비용이 또 필요하기때문에, 이 달력들이 세상의 빛을 보는데에 여러분의 도움이 절실히 필요합니다! 
캠페인 목표 달성시, 아래와 같은 선물을 받으실 수 있습니다:



5$ 후원시: 당신의 따뜻한 마음이 느껴집니다! 제가 좋아하는 일을 할 수 있도록, 이 달력이 태어날 수 있도록 도와주셔서 너무나도 감사드립니다! 달력을 만드는 데 쓰인 사진들 중 하나가 인쇄된 카드로 감사의 마음을 전달하겠습니다.  


10$ 후원시: 아름다운 그대여, 밀어주셔서 너무나 감사드리고 120g Standard White Mat Paper에 인쇄된 달력을 보내 드리겠습니다. 


20$ 후원시: 사랑스러운 당신, 후원해주셔서 너무나 감사드리고 250g Natural White Mat Paper에 인쇄된 달력을 보내드리겠습니다. 


30$ 후원시: 갈비뼈가 부러지도록 껴안아주고 싶은 당신, 이렇게 팍팍 밀어주셔서 너무나 감사드리고 250g Natural White Mat Paper에 인쇄된 달력  1부와 120g Standard White Mat Paper에 인쇄된 달력 1부를 같이 보내드리겠습니다.  


40$ 후원시: 어머나, 당신은 멋쟁이! 이렇게 적극적으로 밀어주셔서 너무나 감사드리고 250g Natural White Mat Paper에 인쇄된 달력 2부를 보내드리겠습니다.


50$ 후원시: 당신은 슈퍼스타! 이렇게 무조건적인 사랑으로 밀어 주셔서 너무나 감사 드리고 250g Natural White Mat Paper에 인쇄된 달력 2부와 120g  Standard White Mat Paper에 인쇄된 달력 1부를 같이 보내드리겠습니다.




만약캠페인목표를달성하지못하면…


아쉽게도 캠페인 목표를 달성하지 못한다면, 모아진 돈을 후원해주신 분들께 감사메세지를 전달할 카드(달력을 만드는 데 쓰인 사진들 중 하나가 인쇄된 카드)를 만드는데 쓰도록 하겠습니다. 

전문가도 아닌 제가 그저 짬나는 시간에 즐겨 만드는 것에 이렇게 공적으로 도움을 요청하기 위해 용기를 내야했습니다! 저의 첫 인디고고 캠페인인 만큼 매우 흥분되고 기대되면서도, 동시에 매우 긴장되고 떨리네요. 그렇지만 캠페인 결과와 상관없이 분명 이 캠페인을 통해 무언가를 배우리라 믿어 의심치 않기에, 전 이미 기쁩니다! :-)
감사합니다!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Mission Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>       </strong>Over the past six years a few of my closest friends and I have spent our summers and winters hiking sections of the Appalachian Trail (AT).  As an artist and photographer, the first time I set foot on the AT I  dreamed of creating a unique conceptual photography book that was beyond the typical pretty flowers and beautiful landscapes. Through abstraction, surrealism and hyper-realism, my work aims to reveal the inter-connectivity between human and nature.  </p>
<p>        This project is about more than just the hike – it is about redefinition, exploration, discovery, discipline, play, and inspiration. It is an all-American pilgrimage, a journey that brings me back to a different reality rooted in the wild Appalachian Mountains. The Appalachian Trail changed my life and view of the world.  This project will give back to the AT and serve as a big ol’ thank you to the volunteers who make it all possible.</p>
<p>        The Thru-Project will annually donate 25% of all proceeds from publication and print sales to AT volunteer conservation clubs and organizations in perpetuity!  We hope to continually serve as a catalyst for AT awareness and to encourage other artistic endeavors that support the conservation of the American wilderness.</p>
<p>        I will be creating this book with the help of The Thru-Project team and favorite people in the world. Joel Dallas is our writer and technical coordinator. Bryan Anderson is my photo assistant and jester. Jarred Douglas is the project’s Polish muscle and facilitator of all things wilderness survival.

<p><strong>Project over-view/ Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>      The Thru-Project has two core priorities. One is to hike the entirety of the Appalachian Trail (2,181-miles) in a single continuous effort. We are starting our journey in the second week of March 2013.  Another, and equally important priority is to create exceptional photography along the way. The Thru-Project aims to photographically and conceptually merge the beauty of nature and the visceral human struggle of existence within the wilderness. The Thru-Project team consists of four veteran hikers; blood brothers who are seasoned in the tribulations of nature’s serenity and violence.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://thru-at.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/campfile.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>     Challenges to accomplishing the thru-hike goal include logistical planning, mapping, maintaining healthy hiking machines and putting our minds over matter. Through experience the Thru-Project knows that at times it is very difficult to re-supply nutritional foods along the trail. In some instances there may only be a single gas station to buy food in a hundred mile stretch. Think about surviving on gas station food or the scant offerings of a rural grocery store, while hiking a marathon everyday for five days, and you get the idea.</p>
<p>      The Thru-Project will require care packages with nutritional supplements and essential gear (Pecans, cranberries, pistachios, oats, apricots, whey protein, water purifiers, batteries etc.) posted to them along the way in order to ensure optimal nutrition and to keep costs down.</p>
<p>      It is estimated that each mile of trail hiked costs $1-2 per person in food alone. It takes an absurd amount of calories (upwards of 6,000 per day) to move your body plus 40-50 lbs on your back up a mountain, and then down it, for five to six months. Funds will be necessary to buy healthy foods in bulk, and then to package and mail these essential items to the team at post offices along the trail.</p>
<p>        A main priority is the Thru-Project’s artistic and creative production. The necessary photographic equipment is far too heavy for a single person to carry along roughly 2,181 miles of trail. The equipment, food, and gear will need to be divided amongst the four members. Through this division of labor the team can move more efficiently, eat healthier, plan wisely, and create amazing photography. The Thru-Project’s creativity will thrive on inspiration drawn from our toils and visions on the mountain.     </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://thru-at.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/sky.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>       With the weight distributed and certain planning tasks delegated amongst the team members, the photographer will be lighter on his feet and capable of composing the images that will become the prints and pages for the Thru-Project book. The members of the Thru-Project team have hiked together and taken fantastic photographs before, but this is the first time that creating photography will be their priority.          </p>
<p>      Part of the ethos of the Appalachian Trail is that it is the people’s trail. The Appalachian Trail is the world’s longest and oldest volunteer maintained hiking trail.  The community surrounding the trail contributes not only to the maintenance of the trail, but also supports countless hikers with trail magic and kind assistance from trail angels. We want to give back to that community by taking this pilgrimage and creating art inspired by the culture of the Appalachian Trail.</p>
<p>     Completing a thru-hike is a dream the members of the Thru-Project have shared for several years now. Together, they have section hiked nearly half the trail in a yearly summer and winter ritual. They have been frozen into the crevices of the Tennessee-North Carolina border in the notorious ’09 blizzard, and have been rained on for a week and a half straight in the Pisgah National Forest. The members of the team know that the trail is no cakewalk and are adaptive problem solvers. They have honed their hiking skills over the years and are prepared for the journey ahead with a little help from you.</p>

</div></div>","My Story
I have spent over ten years documenting the disappearing peasant traditions of Maramures, northern Transylvania, Romania. This work has just been released in my first book, The Color of Hay: The Peasants of Maramures. Twenty photographs have been curated in to the Folk Culture and Non-Material Heritage exhibition during the Xiang Sha Wan Photo Week in inner-Mongolia, China, July, 2011.
This show is an opportunity for a very different audience to see and appreciate the way traditions are both disappearing and persevering as modernity sweeps the developing world. 
I’ve also been invited to accompany my work. And that is where I need help. While the show is offering money to defray the cost of the plane ticket, it doesn’t cover it all costs and I need to raise more in order to go. 
The Impact
This is a fantastic cross cultural event focusing on the non-verbal transmission of traditions and this is exactly what my work is about. By attending in person, I will be able to answer questions in person, giving the attendees a much richer appreciation about this work. 
For me, it will be an amazing opportunity to share in and be part of the Chinese photo community, one that is growing and emerging in the photo world. This will be my first exhibition in China and I hope attending in person will open up many more doors then simply sending the photographs.
What I Need
These are the remaining expenses: 
$250 Airfare for inside China (Beijing – Baotou)$180 Portfolio Shipping Case$150 20x24 Paper$200 Mat Board$150 Ink for Prints$130  VISA
Total: $1,000

</p><p><br/></p><p>Von uns für Euch und zusammen für Alle: begrüßt die
fesche Sopherl und die Pummerin! In ihrem früheren Leben waren sie mal
Snowboards, aber wir haben ihnen zum Coming-out verholfen und sie zurück auf
die richtige Bahn gebracht: als upcycled Longboards machen sie nicht nur Dich
glücklich, sondern die Welt auch ein bisschen besser. Und so geht's:</p><p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/605189/files/20140526114105-ueberschriften1.jpg?1401129665"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p>
</p><p>Jedes RUFFBOARD ist ein <b>Einzelstück</b>, hergestellt aus
ausrangierten, aber liebgewonnenen Snowboards und jeweils in einem einmaligen
Design gestaltet.</p>
<p>Durch unsere einzigartige Technologie bleibt die
originale Snowboardoberfläche erhalten, während die neuen Longboards die nötige
Stabilität bekommen.</p>
<p>Mit <b>Deiner Hilfe</b> geben wir alten Snowboards eine zweite
Chance!</p><p></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/605192/files/20140526114130-ueberschriften2.jpg?1401129690"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p>
</p><p>Die Herstellung unserer RUFFBOARDS ist 100%
umweltfreundlich: Wir produzieren mit Strom aus regenerativen Quellen und
verwenden pflanzliche Harze - der schrittweise Ersatz aller umweltschädigenden
Werkstoffe und Herstellungsverfahren ist zentraler Bestandteil unserer
Produktion.</p>
<p>Seit den 90er Jahren wurden in Österreich rund 500.000
Snowboards verkauft. Dies entspricht etwa 2 Millionen Tonnen Sperrmüll. Durch
die Produktion von 500 RUFFBOARDS, also das Upcycling alter Snowboards,
ersparen wir unserer Umwelt rund 1,5 Tonnen Sperrmüll.</p>
<p><b>Umweltfreundliche Produktion </b>statt Müllberge!</p><p></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/605193/files/20140526114148-ueberschriften3.jpg?1401129708"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>Die Zusammenarbeit mit dem Verein NEU<b>START</b> soll
straffällig gewordenen Menschen durch praktische Resozialisierungshilfe
unterstützen, ihren neuen Platz in der Gesellschaft zu finden.</p>
<p>In der professionellen Werkstatt entstehen so
handgefertigte RUFFBOARDS in höchster Qualität und diese werden noch dazu mit Liebe und
viel Engagement gemacht.</p>
<p>Auch <b>Dein RUFFBOARD hilft</b>, weitere <b>Arbeitsplätze</b> zu

fesche Sopherl und die Pummerin! In ihrem früheren Leben waren sie mal
Snowboards, aber wir haben ihnen zum Coming-out verholfen und sie zurück auf
die richtige Bahn gebracht: als upcycled Longboards machen sie nicht nur Dich
glücklich, sondern die Welt auch ein bisschen besser. Und so geht's:

Jedes RUFFBOARD ist ein Einzelstück, hergestellt aus
ausrangierten, aber liebgewonnenen Snowboards und jeweils in einem einmaligen
Design gestaltet.
Durch unsere einzigartige Technologie bleibt die
originale Snowboardoberfläche erhalten, während die neuen Longboards die nötige
Stabilität bekommen.
Mit Deiner Hilfe geben wir alten Snowboards eine zweite
Chance!
Die Herstellung unserer RUFFBOARDS ist 100%
umweltfreundlich: Wir produzieren mit Strom aus regenerativen Quellen und
verwenden pflanzliche Harze - der schrittweise Ersatz aller umweltschädigenden
Werkstoffe und Herstellungsverfahren ist zentraler Bestandteil unserer
Produktion.
Seit den 90er Jahren wurden in Österreich rund 500.000
Snowboards verkauft. Dies entspricht etwa 2 Millionen Tonnen Sperrmüll. Durch
die Produktion von 500 RUFFBOARDS, also das Upcycling alter Snowboards,
ersparen wir unserer Umwelt rund 1,5 Tonnen Sperrmüll.
Umweltfreundliche Produktion statt Müllberge!
Die Zusammenarbeit mit dem Verein NEUSTART soll
straffällig gewordenen Menschen durch praktische Resozialisierungshilfe
unterstützen, ihren neuen Platz in der Gesellschaft zu finden.
In der professionellen Werkstatt entstehen so
handgefertigte RUFFBOARDS in höchster Qualität und diese werden noch dazu mit Liebe und
viel Engagement gemacht.
Auch Dein RUFFBOARD hilft, weitere Arbeitsplätze zu
schaffen und noch mehr jungen Menschen die Chance auf einen erfolgreichen
NEUSTART zu geben!
Die fesche Sopherl und die Pummerin finden immer mehr
Fans. Mit dem Erlös aus der Crowdfunding-Kampagne werden dringend benötigte
Arbeitsplätze für ehemalige Häftlinge geschaffen und ausgestattet.
Wir haben uns ganz bewusst dafür entschieden, mit dem
Verein NEUSTART zu kooperieren und damit jenen  Menschen einen
Arbeitsplatz zu bieten, denen von der Gesellschaft zu oft eine zweite Chance
verwehrt wird.
Mit Deiner Unterstützung kurbeln wir unsere Produktion
weiter an und schaffen bis Mitte 2015 fünf neue Arbeitsplätze!

<div>Hello! I recently received a photography fellowship from the amazing organization, Soko, based in Nairobi, Kenya. Soko's mission is create the first online marketplace where international consumers can buy goods directly from artisans around the world. With the tools that Soko provides, artisans are able to participate in the global marketplace, find new customers, and share their handcrafted items with the world. They promote small scale, environmentally friendly production with materials that are locally sourced, up cycled, or recycled. Though they by no means exclude men from participating, empowering women and increasing access to economic opportunities for women is one of their goals. </div>
<div>I will be traveling to Kenya for two months, working with Soko to photograph portraits of their artisans, their products, and teaching workshops to artisans in Nairobi and throughout Kenya on how to better photograph their goods using the cameras they have access to and use natural light as well as homemade light boxes to enhance their items. I believe that beautiful portraits can help connect a buyer to a seller and also boost sales. Being able to implement and establish a standard of photography for product photography will also bring in more sales, more acclaim, and will help establish the artisans as true artists in their fields. </div>
<div>The artist portraits that I plan to shoot will show the public who these artists are, it will help define them, their work, their artistic process, and their stories. Soko will also be able to provide beautiful portraits and photographs of items to press and media and be able to further their mission of peer to peer international sales. I have previously worked with the non-profit Awamaki Lab, based in Peru, and the photographs that I took  for them have been used for press in magazines such as Vogue India, Elle Mexico, Blackbook, Martha Stewart Living, and others, increasing global awareness of the organization and its mission. I hope to do the same with Soko. Some of that work can be seen on my website at <a href=""http://www.katereeder.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.katereeder.com</a> .</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All in all, pretty awesome, but also pretty expensive. Though Soko will be able to assist me in finding and making connections with the artisans, help me navigate through the sometimes difficult nature of traveling to small and isolated towns, and provide me with a safe space to work and lead workshops, they are already stretched pretty tight financially and getting from New York to Nairobi can cost quite a bit. In order to get there with the resources and supplies necessary I'll need some financial help! Help cover the cost of my flight, accommodations, vaccinations, and travel throughout Kenya, and help bring better photography skills and resources to artists. With enough financial support I will also be able to invest in some digital cameras and lighting equipment that I can leave with Soko for their artists to come and use whenever they have need. </div>
<p>Giving to this campaign won't leave you empty handed! Besides feeling like an awesome person for chipping in, I am also offering some pretty sweet perks! If you can't give financially but would still like to support this project please post a link to your Facebook/twitter/social media outlet of choice and spread the word! Thank you!!!!</p>

For transport within Australia and New Zealand, flights within these countries range from $100 to $300, and Hostels and budget hotels range from $30 to $120 a night. The $8000 transport and lodging budget should allow me flexibility to explore new leads and, well, not get stranded and attacked by renegade kangaroos. 
$1000 will go towards camera equipment, including (but not limited to):
Canon Speedlite 600EX-RT ($500)
Bolt VM-110 LED Macro Ring Light ($80)
3 x SanDisk 32GB SDHC Memory Card Extreme Pro Class 10 UHS-1 ($150)
The remaining budget (appx. $5000) goes towards primary publication, PR, and marketing of the book, which shall be done under new creative start-up, The Okazigo Media Company. This includes the initial production of 200 hardcover copies and social media and digital outreach and marketing, with a strategically estimated budget of $2000.

What You Can Receive!
Now while my requests may seem daunting, the perks are pretty awesome! 
Perks range based on the amounts you contribute, with the most minimal of them ($50) being an addition to the book's ""Member's Club"", because at the very least, you should be recognized for your dedication to this creative endeavor.
However as the amounts get bigger, the perks get more fun, including signed copies of the finished book, interview and possible inclusion in the book, taking requests to hold up a sign at a match, and even tickets to world cup matches ($1000). 
For the $5000 donor there is a ticket waiting for them to join me at the World Cup Finals on March 29 and I will interview and photograph them for the book.* They will also receive a free, signed copy of the book. 
Please see the perks section for specific details and amounts. 


 
  Other Ways You Can Help
While I am most in need of financial support, you can help Wickets & Weirdness in several other ways:
- SHARE this Indiegogo page! Do you know someone that loves cricket? Send them this link. Do you know someone who at the very least will enjoy the book? Send them this link. Let cricket loving friends know I am out there and looking to make my concept a reality! Use Facebook, Twitter, Email, your voice - anything. Spreading the word is the only way an eccentric billionaire will find out about my book and fund it! 
- Will you be Down Under during the World Cup? Let me know and I'm sure we can grab a beer and chat cricket.  Maybe you'll end up in the book!
- Got suggestions of cricketers and cricket fans Down Under that I should meet? Maybe your creepy grade school groundskeeper? What about your superstitious friend who never misses a match?  Your niece who is a batting prodigy equal to Don Bradman? Spread the word and put me in touch - I want to capture a full scope of cricket lovers. They don't have to even be that odd!
- Follow me on Twitter and on my cricket blog, Napoleon Einstein to get updates about my journey, including first draft photos, videos, and other surprises. 

Thank You so much for your support!

<p><b>The Napier Photo Collective</b> is a group of 18 photographers and filmmakers who are in their fourth and final year at Edinburgh Napier University. In June we will be travelling down to London to exhibit our work at Free Range (at The Old Truman Brewery), an annual event featuring the work of graduates from across the country and pulling in huge visitor numbers (in excess of 100,000). By exhibiting at Free Range we can expect to have our work seen by many more people than a traditional degree show or independent exhibition - this is an opportunity to connect with other students and industry professionals and shape our future careers. This is not the first time that students from Edinburgh Napier have taken their work to Free Range, but we are the last group to come from the Photography and Film BA (Hons) course. We want to take this opportunity to showcase the work of both photographers and filmmakers, and celebrate the benefits of these two groups working alongside each other at Edinburgh Napier for the final time. As with all things worth doing the road to Free Range isn't easy or cheap, but it's one that we are passionate about taking, and with your help we can put on an exhibition that we can be proud of. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am an Irish/Italian photographer and writer who has been living in the UK most of my life. My interests are in participatory practice and social documentary, with a strong focus on ethics in photography.</p>
<p><i>Delta</i> is a photographic project that I have been working on as part of my MA in Documentary Photography and Photojournalism at the University of Westminster.  The project, taking its name from Adrienne Rich's poem Delta, asks those who identify or are read by society as women to consider when they first recall experiencing sexual harassment, and to contribute an image of themselves at that age.  A collection of poetry, testimonies and reflections provided by project participants is bound into an accompanying book in which the audience can also write. This solid, tactile item that cannot be easily erased signals my contract with the participants and audience that the stories entrusted to me will not be ignored, dismissed or disbelieved. </p>
<p>In the wake of the #metoo movement, and with the aim of starting a conversation that may help to shape a more egalitarian society, the project seeks to reframe some common assumptions about sexual harassment and encourage reflection on when we all start learning.</p>
<p>This campaign is specifically raising funds to build an installation to show the work in a way that aims to support people engaging with a difficult subject.  </p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, a circular stand-alone wall, with a wide entry point at one end. The photos will be on the outside wall. The inside will be plain and hold a stand with the book on it.  The stand will be sloped so you can open, read and write in the book while sheltered by the protective embrace of the wall, always being able to see the entry/exit point.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contribution will go towards the cost of materials, labour and transport for the specific installation build that aims to make this difficult subject more accessible.  This is a whopping £1900 and why I am asking for your support.</p>
<p>The rest of the project (including printing, wall painting and much more) is self funded.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that I raise more than £1900 I undertake to donate the rest to Medicine Sans Frontieres (MSF).</p>
<p>I plan to offer a number of perks for people who are feeling particularly generous - please check the perks section!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will support me in my aim to present this work in a unique way.  Instead of defaulting to a traditional flat wall, I want to use space as a tool to support participation and engagement with a challenging subject.  The design is mindful of the risk of triggering those who have been subjected to sexual harassment. It seeks to avoid shock tactics, building in a space where those who want to read the hard hitting written contributions by participants can do so in a supportive environment that is not overlooked.  It is my hope that this space will create an environment which is encouraging of reflection, debate and discussion and perhaps even participation.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The exhibition is part of an MA Final Show and will happen regardless of whether the funding target is achieved.   The funding is directed specifically towards creating a space (or build) that aims to support people engaging with a difficult subject.  </p>
<p>The design of the installation resolves a challenge; previously, you could be overlooked while reading and writing in the book.  </p>

</h2><p>The Once Home project is organized by InLiquid, a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the work of Philadelphia’s diverse community of artists. Over the past 20 years, InLiquid has worked with nearly 1,000 local painters, sculptors, photographers, and craftspeople.</p><p>Artists, Khalif Rivers and Howard Traivers each grew up alongside the collapse of manufacturing in Philadelphia.

The Once Home project is organized by InLiquid, a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the work of Philadelphia’s diverse community of artists. Over the past 20 years, InLiquid has worked with nearly 1,000 local painters, sculptors, photographers, and craftspeople.Artists, Khalif Rivers and Howard Traivers each grew up alongside the collapse of manufacturing in Philadelphia. In 2015, Traivers became homeless and took shelter in the abandoned factory where his father was once employed. Rivers captures hidden remnants of industry within the city's unique landscape. Both artists have an uncanny ability to express emotion in photographs void of human presence; primarily desolate urban landscapes. These stories are increasingly important to tell in the context of South Kensington, Philadelphia where there is a surge of real estate development alongside the city’s largest homeless population. Homeless youth from local shelters will participate in discussions and art-making workshops in the exhibition at InLiquid Gallery.When you choose to support Once Home, you are giving a voice to artists who would not otherwise have the resources to print, frame, and display their work.

<p>======</p>
<p><strong>how this started</strong></p>
<p>This particular project began with two unexpected dragonfly visitors on my windowsill. Intrigued by the complex geometries created by their overlapping wings, I made a series of photographs and created a miniature portfolio in a limited edition of 100.

<p><strong>the project itself</strong></p>
<p>The windowsill moment led to discoveries of other creatures with intricate wing structures, and to the idea of a larger photographic series containing dragonflies, damselflies, cicadas, and similar insects with ‘filigreed’ wings. This project will take a closer look at the extraordinary details in the sometimes-unlikely subjects around us. “Fragile magic” someone called it. The final product will be a series of archival portfolio prints. See giveaways at right for more detail.</p>
<p><strong>nuts and bolts: specimen resources</strong></p>
<p>One of the Smithsonian’s entomology collections will be a primary source of specimens, where they have drawers and drawers of bugs! Other specimens are being sought through word of mouth.

<p><strong>how you go about helping</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to this approach to art patronage, here’s how it works: You click over on the right and make an underwriting pledge – like underwriting your favorite <span class=""caps"">NPR</span> or <span class=""caps"">PBS</span> program. And like underwriting an <span class=""caps"">NPR</span> or <span class=""caps"">PBS</span> program, you get a thank-you gift: a print or a complete portfolio.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Hopefully some of you already know who I am and what I'm about. For those of you that don't, I am a professional cosplayer, model, comic book colorist. I also ran for office in the state of Arizona, I have passed legislature that benefits children, and I have fostered puppies this year.</p>
<p>I am a HUGE supporter of cosplay, as a craft, as a passion and as a means to live. I strongly believe cosplay is for <u>everyone</u> and I love the impact that it has had in my life. This book is a compilation of photos from my cosplay beginning plus some added content that has never been printed before. 12 Extra Pages!  &lt;3</p>

<p>The Photobook series has been INSANELY successful! Thousands of books, which are comic sized, vibrant full color and filled with costumes, have gone with you faithful fans.

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>I have so many messages from people wanting to complete their collection with Photobook 1. I did several print runs of it back in 2012 and they flew off the shelves and off my convention table. These are very hard to find! To me, the book is a symbol of what cosplay can be, what it can do. And you get to have a copy of your own!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I'm Kitty McGilliwiggles, or that's what my pen-name and artist equivalent is. I graduated from Drexel University's Media Arts school in 2011. I have a Nikon D80 I bargained from a relative, along with a small daylight-balanced fluorescent light kit. I'm working freelance photography gigs in the Northern Virginia area; portraits, pet portraits, small event photography, landscape art prints...Black and white or full color. I could still use a few sundry bits of equipment, a warm-toned reflector umbrella, sheets of color gels, and high-output fluorescent lamps balanced to 3200K. I also need to pay start-up business administrative fees, like the fee to register my trade name with the county and the fee to declare candidacy for a certification from the Professional Photographers of America. I'd also like to make the switch from Photoshop Elements 10 to full Photoshop, and that software is several hundred dollars.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've set the goal at $1450. Raising the funds through IndieGoGo, using Paypal, and accepting credit card transactions will incur fees for me. There is a buffer on my goal to cover the maximum IndieGoGo fees and still allow plenty of funds for me to square away my business administrative costs. If I don't reach the goal, I'll still be I'll still be paying for those things in the long run, after I have several paying gigs. First thing on my list is registering my trade name, next stronger lamps for my light fixtures, then the CPP test from the PPA. Being a new business, that credential could really give me some legitimacy and then people will grumble less about paying me the same rates as ""established"" photographers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know people are going to want something in return, so I've got a few ideas for that.</p>
<p>&gt; $15 earns you a full resolution landscape jpeg, watermarked in the corner</p>
<p>&gt; $30 earns you an 8.5""x11"" glossy landscape print</p>
<p>&gt; $50 earns you a half-hour portrait session, 15-30 jpegs, watermarked (must be redeemed within 25 miles of 22153 zip code area)</p>
<p>&gt; $100 earns you a full-hour portrait session, 30-60 jpegs, watermarked (must be redeemed within 25 miles of 22153 zip code area)</p>

As TreeGirl, my passion is not only to meet new trees, learn about them, and photograph myself with them, but to inspire others to connect intimately and soulfully with wild nature. 
Brush Box tree (Lophostemon confertus), AustraliaAs a fine-art photographer, certified arborist and naturalist, conservation educator, and forest ecotherapist, over the past 20 years I have climbed, listened to, intertwined with, and photographed myself in the nude with over 70 spectacular species of trees all over the world, with the aid of my tripod and remote control.                 Why? Because it is an unparalleled experience to bond with nature! Trees are my love, my family, my community, my home. And I want to show that trees are not only integral for the functioning of the planet, but they also can be a resource for inspiration, wisdom, energy, companionship and allyship for all of us.     There is no other book like this! The TreeGirl book combines fine-art nude photography, with natural history and the ecopsychology of the human-tree relationship.Morton Bay Fig tree (Ficus macrophylla), Australia TreeGirl: Intimate Encounters with Wild Nature goes beyond classic pictures of nature or the female nude; it captures dynamic relationships between living beings, while inviting possibilities for the reader's own interspecies connections. Monterey Cypress tree (Cupressus macrocarpa), North Island, New Zealand The TreeGirl book is an invitation for you to come home to wild nature.Green Fig (Ficus virens), Australia BOOK DESCRIPTION:
TreeGirl: Intimate Encounters with Wild Nature  is:• A stunning, full-color, clothbound, hardcover coffee-table book• A collection of over 150 photographs, including 20 new tree species not yet in my TreeGirl website gallery—with some images never before seen.• 200 pages in an 11-by-11 inch format.• Printed on 100% post-consumer-waste recycled paper.• Foreworded by Fred Hageneder, German music composer and author of seven books on the ethnobotany and spirituality of trees. http://www.themeaningoftrees.com/about• Gorgeously designed by Annett Boerner from Australia.• The first book of its kind, combining photography, natural history, and ecopsychology.  All of the photographs were taken by me, with the exception of two collaborations with Devin Fleurdujon and Caiyloirch Rupert Marques,and  13 botanical natural history photos from talented photographers, including: Marilyn McFarlin, Hal Brindley, Dave Ingram, Martin Fletcher, Kristen Rasmussen, Annett Boerner and Dean Nicolle. TABLE OF CONTENTSThe TreeGirl book goes behind the scenes of what it is to be TreeGirl, and answers questions tree lovers have about these spectacular trees. In the TreeGirl book, you will find photographs and writing of my 50 favorite species. Some of the trees pictured are the oldest, the tallest, and the biggest of their species. And because people always want to know about these trees, the photos are accompanied by their natural history, ethnobotany, conservation status, and narrative captions of my wild encounter with each tree.SAMPLE PAGES INCLUDING PHOTOS, NATURAL HISTORY AND STORYInterwoven with the species profiles are five essays that holistically address aspects of the human-tree relationship:• the sensual (physical)• the biophilic (ecopsychological)• the arboricultural (ecological)• the archetypal (spiritual), and • the practical ways in which readers can rewild themselves and have their own intimate encounters with nature (therapeutic). People love this beautiful book, and it hasn't even been released yet. Read some of the Advance Praise for the Book: The core of the book's message is: We can repair our collective cultural disconnection from Nature by rediscovering trees as allies and as a sanctuary from the madness of modern technological civilization.3000 year-old Panosos Olive tree (Olea europaea), Crete, Greece BOOK PRODUCTION & TIMELINE:SEPTEMBER 25th: The Campaign starts! At the end of this month, 2,000 TreeGirl books will go to print in Germany! (Why Germany? It was more affordable than other countries, with precision one can count on, and the ability to get 100% post-consumer waste recycled paper!)OCTOBER: The Campaign ends at midnight (PST) October 25th!  Trees and tree lovers all over the world celebrate! The books get boxed and head over the Atlantic Ocean on a long ocean voyage!NOVEMBER: The books are still sailing over the Atlantic, till at last...DECEMBER 1-ish:  The TreeGirl books arrive like a grateful immigrants, passing efficiently through customs blessed by the tree angels. They are delivered to my distributor's warehouse in Tennessee, who then ships some special boxes to me overnight, to give you as Indiegogo Perks in time for the Holiday Season!JANUARY 15th: The TreeGirl book is available for purchase in bookstores nationwide, including online at Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble.com in the US. It will also be distributed in Canada and the UK. The book becomes an instant best-seller thanks to your continued sharing! COST OF THE BOOK:This book has been a labor of love for the trees! There are many costs to writing and self-publishing a full-color book. Over the past eight years, I have personally invested tens of thousands of dollars into creating this first-of-its-kind book, including travel expenses, photographic equipment, workshops, research, consulting, assistance, professional editing, professional book design, and miscellaneous technical and professional expenses.I estimate the total cost of this project to be over $100K, including the upcoming costs of printing and promotion. The TreeGirl book itself is priced to retail at an affordable $45. Your reward for contributing $55 or more to this campaign  will be to receive your own personally signed pre-published copy before it's available anywhere else!After this campaign, personally signed books will only be available at TreeGirl book events. And, if you contribute $200 or more, you can also receive other exclusive Indiegogo Perks, including limited edition fine-art prints, being photographed by TreeGirl, or the ultimate Perk: the once-in-a-life-time opportunity to accompany TreeGirl on an all expense paid international photo shoot adventure! HOW YOU ARE SUPPORTING THE BOOK:1. By sharing this campaign on all your social media, and liking my FaceBook Page: https://www.facebook.com/TreeGirlPhoto/2. By telling all your nature-loving friends and family about the TreeGirl book.3. By suggesting locations, radio shows and podcasts for TreeGirl book presentations. 4. By contributing as much as your heart can to this campaign now! Not only are you helping TreeGirl finish paying for her eight-year personal investment in this project, but you are also helping the trees themselves.10% of the funds raised in this campaign will go toward tropical reforestation projects via TreeGirl's partnership with the successful, woman-powered www.treesisters.org!THE CAMPAIGN GOAL:  Minimum: $25,000Ideal: $45,000Since 10% of the funds raised goes to Indiegogo, and 10% goes to TreeSisters to fund reforestation projects, if the ideal goal is reached, the TreeGirl book project will receive $36,000. Promotion is critical, especially for a self-published book. Any funding over the goal is deeply appreciated, from the bottom of my TreeGirl heart, as it will not only help pay off the initial personal investment of self-publishing, but it will also provide the thousands of dollars still to be invested in promotion and book tours. Why not buy your holiday gifts now?Imagine how much your tree-loving friends will love you  when you give each of them their very own signed copy of TreeGirl: Intimate Encounters with Wild Nature!Each and every contribution is vital to the birth of this book and for thousands of trees!

<h3>The Project...</h3>
<p>Or should I say projects?!</p>
<p><u><strong>Project 1</strong></u></p>
<p>On my expedition along the entire Cornish coastline I plan to photograph every beach, creating a consistent catalogue of the coast that surrounds this land steeped in rich history.</p>
<p>The future is yet unwritten for British coastlines, if we lose our sandy (and some not so sandy) shores it is important that future generations have a document of what was lost.</p>
<p>I plan to develop these images into a book at a later date.</p>
<p><u><strong>Project 2</strong></u> </p>
<p><strong>The sand!</strong> Oh what an underrated beauty sand beholds, and not just as a collective on a beach, each individual grain is a historical imprint on the landscape, be it a microscope speck of what was once a shell that belonged to an extinct Mollusc, or a tiny piece of hard coral.</p>
<p>I will collect a very small sand sample from every accessible beach I encounter, I will upon my return, using a microscope, create a series of images allowing an insight into the microscopic world and hopefully develop them into a book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Route!</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I will arrive in Plymouth and immediately head south along the coastal path, passing by familiar and not so familiar coastal towns and locations such as; Looe, Charlestown, Roseland, Falmouth, Lizard, Penzance right down to Lands end. I will then head along the North shore past St Ives, Godrevy, Newquay, Port Isaac, Widemouth until I reach just north of Bude.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Your Contribution!</h3>
<p>Every penny that people are so kind to donate will go towards supplies for the trip itself, camping gear, food, camera film (that's right I said film!), ferry fares (this is a hike not a swim!) In return for your kind contribution I have listed some wonderful thank you gifts and perks!</p>

<p>Earlier this year i undertook one of my biggest photographic projects to date, entitled ""The Dark Carnival"" An idea i had in my mind for the past few years to bring to life a forgotten carnival, with slight horror elements and a feel of the macabre,</p>
<p>I finally bit the bullet and started planning the shoot, 3 months from start to finish with 7 models, designers, costume makers, stylists and makeup artists involved on the day. The photoshoot was a complete success, it was everything i had wanted it to be, the budget was zero and the final results were spectacular. </p>
<p><b>The Second Coming. </b></p>
<p>So why you may ask, do i want to do another project of the same theme? The answer is simple, to aim higher. </p>
<p>The last project was planned from nothing, it cost nothing, the models, and everyone involved gave up their time for free to be involved. We shot at an outdoor location in public space. But with last minute changes, models dropping out and a costume designer pulling out a few days before, it wasn't everything it could have been. I always had the idea in my mind to make it huge, with 7 different characters on set for it there was an element of grandeur and lost decadence. </p>
<p>But it was missing certain aspects, more characters i had planned, more extravagant costumes, a larger gore element and more props that better suited the visual styling which was almost impossible to achieve with no budget. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The Plan.</b></p>
<p>Simply, to go bigger! Bolder! By Crowdfunding the project with a small budget, it will enable me to finally bring the Dark Carnival to it's full potential. Hiring a venue to work at for a day or weekend, buying / hiring costumes, building set pieces and props. hiring larger lighting kits. Being able to hire prosthetic artists, fire performers (and Health and safety people) the list goes on. </p>
<p>The ideal would be to create not just static photography but create moving image, to bring the characters to life, to bring movement to an otherwise fixed world. To create a short video telling the stories of how the characters came to be that way. Unfortunatly i am unable to produce video with my current photography equipment, however if this project exceeds it's funding goals, any extra money would be used to invest in video equipment or to hire a videographer / film maker to assist on the project. </p>
<p>A small contribution could make for a huge difference. As mentioned, the last project was built from nothing and the results (In my eyes) were amazing. The sequel will be nothing short of spectacular. </p>
<p><b>The Result.</b></p>
<p>So why am i doing this at all? Honestly, because i enjoy photography, i enjoy creating art. Provocative, sensual, scary, disturbing. Bringing to life the images in my head for no reason other than because i can do so through the medium of photography.</p>
<p>The final work will be used mostly for showcasing myself and Darkslide Photography. To submit to publication and eventually to bring together in an art book, calendar or similar. </p>
<p><b>When.</b></p>
<p>Aiming for photography to take place mid november with a release date of the work before Christmas. </p></span></div>","The History

<p>""How the other half lives"" is a photobook about <b>stray cats</b>. Through interviews with different stray cats we learn about their lives, about being down and out, segregated and discriminated. But we also read stories of real freedom and independence.</p>

And then we see them: Strong personalities, full of dignity. <br/><br/>The book is a sometimes harsh commentary on modern day (cat-)society, representing a totally unbalanced view.

<h3>The production</h3>
<p>After almost two years of work on the project, ""How the other half lives"" will be released in late April 2015. It will be my 5th <b>self-published</b> title.</p>
<p>I have been committed to self-publishing for many years now. I understand it as a way to stay independent from the demand of the editorial- and art-market and thus being able to produce works without making any compromises.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1157045/files/20150118095956-production_htohl.jpg?1421603996"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The aim of this crowdfunding campaign is to <b>raise a part of the book's production costs</b> (<i>I'd like to raise half of the costs here and put the other half myself, I am still negotiating with 3 printers/binderies, as soon as I have a precise estimation of costs, I will give you an update, just to keep things transparent</i>). The overall costs are very low as printing and binding are the only parts of the process I won't do myself. All the rest is essentially a one-person job: I did the photography, the layout and the overall design-concept of the book and will do the reproduction (scanning analogue hand-prints of the negatives) and pre-print processing. Like this I don't have to pay any designer, lab-guy, editor or publisher and you get a very well produced book for very little money. To guarantee this, I collaborate with cutting edge printers and binders here in Berlin where I live and can control the whole production.
<p>Still you shouldn't expect a perfect product like the ones you would get from a big publisher. And that's part of the idea: The book is gonna have its edges and will have a raw feeling to it. Unlike the typical coffee-table book.</p>

<br/><h3>Challenges</h3>
<h2>
</h2>

</div></div>","The project

""How the other half lives"" is a photobook about stray cats. Through interviews with different stray cats we learn about their lives, about being down and out, segregated and discriminated. But we also read stories of real freedom and independence.

The black and white photographs (shot on Hasselblad 500 c/m) show the cats' environment: Courtyards, backstreets and abandoned buildings, all showing signs of decay. And then we see them: Strong personalities, full of dignity. The book is a sometimes harsh commentary on modern day (cat-)society, representing a totally unbalanced view. It's the stray cat's vision of things, very different from what a domesticated cat would tell you.Some quotes from some of the cats:



The production
After almost two years of work on the project, ""How the other half lives"" will be released in late April 2015. It will be my 5th self-published title.
I have been committed to self-publishing for many years now. I understand it as a way to stay independent from the demand of the editorial- and art-market and thus being able to produce works without making any compromises.

The aim of this crowdfunding campaign is to raise a part of the book's production costs (I'd like to raise half of the costs here and put the other half myself, I am still negotiating with 3 printers/binderies, as soon as I have a precise estimation of costs, I will give you an update, just to keep things transparent). The overall costs are very low as printing and binding are the only parts of the process I won't do myself. All the rest is essentially a one-person job: I did the photography, the layout and the overall design-concept of the book and will do the reproduction (scanning analogue hand-prints of the negatives) and pre-print processing. Like this I don't have to pay any designer, lab-guy, editor or publisher and you get a very well produced book for very little money. To guarantee this, I collaborate with cutting edge printers and binders here in Berlin where I live and can control the whole production.
Still you shouldn't expect a perfect product like the ones you would get from a big publisher. And that's part of the idea: The book is gonna have its edges and will have a raw feeling to it. Unlike the typical coffee-table book.

Challenges


As I have 5 years of experience in the field of self-publishing (apart from various collaborations with publishers) I think it's safe to say that I know what is expecting me. So there shouldn't be any mayor setbacks. Of course I could always get ill, but if I cannot make it to the post-office to send you your book or shirt, I'm sure I'll find a friend who'll do so.If I don't arrive at the aim of $4200 (about 3600 €), the book will still be produced and you will still receive your reward. I would then only need to deal with a bank which I would love to avoid.

<p>The Vision</p>
<p>For as long as I can
remember, train travel has been something that I've loved.  Seeing our
beautiful country speed by as I travel to my destination... there's really
nothing quite like it.  </p>
<p>In a few months, I
plan to blend my love of riding the rails with my love of photography as I
embark on a cross country train trip that will take me coast to coast and
back.  During my trip, I will be training my camera on the beautiful
countryside, from the Plains States, to the wonders of the Rocky Mountains, to
the colorful desert landscapes and the alluring Pacific Coastline.  The
best part is, I will be doing all of this from the window of my train
car.  I want to show everyone just how beautiful our America is, and how
much of it you can see from the generous windows of a passenger train.  I
will be posting live on social media the whole way, taking you on the trip with
me! </p>
<p>""Can You Take Good Photos From a Train?""</p>
<p>Actually, some of my favorite photos I've ever taken (including the one above) have been from the window of a train.  Trains often travel through some of the most picturesque parts of our country, featuring views of big cities, small towns and brilliant American landscapes!</p>
<p>""Why Should I
Pay for Your Vacation?""</p>
<p>That's a great
question.  This will not be a vacation so much as a chance to take a
creative adventure that will lead to some beautiful photographs and eventually,
a stunning photo book.  Even at the $5 level, you will receive a photo from my trip!  Think of is as buying a piece of art before it's created... and more than that, knowing that your contribution helped create it!</p>
<p>I intend to work hard, using my photography skills
and equipment to capture our beautiful nation as it speeds by.  While I
love riding the rails and I love photography, I have a goal on this journey,
and that is to produce a unique and magical photographic story of the visual
wonders of this nation, and do it all by train.</p>
<p>The reason I need
your help is simply the fact that a trip like this is very costly and fronting
the cash on a photographer's salary is just not possible.  I'm gonna need a little help along the way
;-)</p>
<p>""What's In It
For Me?""</p>
<p>Another outstanding
question.  Other than having my undying
gratitude and constant shout outs on social media, as well as your name on my
website and the photo book I will be publishing, you will receive free prints and even copies of my photo book for generous contributors!</p>
<p>""Why Do This At
All?""</p>
<p>Because I truly
believe that I have the opportunity to do something that nobody else has ever
done, or at least not to this magnitude. 
I truly believe that as a photographer, I can show people how gorgeous
this country really is, and how much you can see it simply by hopping on a
train and taking an adventure.  I can't
wait to show America just how amazing it is! 
Help me by walking this journey with me!</p>

<div><h3>The Camps</h3></div>
<div>The camps are located near Tindouf in Western Algeria. The place is called ""The Devil's Garden' and there is a reason for that -- the temperatures in summer can easily reach over 50 degrees C. There are 6 in total temporary settlements, refugee camps where live approximately 160,000 people surviving on aid from international community.</div>
<div>In 1975 the last African colony, Western Sahara has been invaded by Moroccans and many people has been forced to exile from their country. Even though under international law the invasion in 1975 was illegal and in 1991 Morocco agreed on referendum Saharawi people are still waiting for resolution for this conflict as well as for their referendum. </div>

<div>
<b><i>Los Campamentos</i></b><br/>
</div>
<div>
<i>Los campamentos se encuentran cerca de Tinduf en el occidente de Argelia. El lugar se llama ""El jardín del diablo"" y hay una razón para esto: las temperaturas en verano pueden llegar fácilmente a más de 50 grados C. Hay un total de 6 asentamientos temporales, campamentos de refugiados donde viven aproximadamente 160.000 personas que sobreviven con ayuda de la comunidad internacional. En 1975, la última colonia en África, el Sáhara Occidental, fue invadida por los marroquíes y mucha gente fue forzada a exiliarse de su país. Aunque, según el derecho internacional, la invasión de 1975 fue ilegal, y en 1991 Marruecos aceptó hacer un referéndum, el pueblo saharaui todavía está a la espera de la resolución de este conflicto, así como de su referéndum.</i><br/>

<div><h3>My Experience</h3></div>
<div>I visited Sahrawi refugee camps in Sahara by a chance. I was exposed to a simple and harsh life people living there. My experience was so strong that just after a month I had to come back to the same place again. I  started to take quick snapshots  to capture just the experience of the moment of being there. Why I found the camps so fascinated? I guess the journeys changed my point of view on different things. Definitely taught me a lot about patience and human dignity. Was unforgettable journey both mentally and physically. </div>

<div>
<b><i>Mi Experiencia</i></b><br/>
</div>
<div>
<i>Visité los campamentos de refugiados saharauis en el desierto del Sáhara por casualidad. Estuve expuesto a la dura y simple vida de la gente que vive allí. Mi experiencia fue tan fuerte que sólo después de un mes tuve que volver al mismo lugar. Empecé a tomar rápidas instantáneas para capturar sólo la experiencia del momento de estar allí. ¿Por qué me parecieron tan fascinantes estos campamentos? Supongo que el viaje ha cambiado mi punto de vista sobre muchas cosas. Definitivamente me enseñó mucho sobre la paciencia y la dignidad humana. Fue un viaje inolvidable, tanto mental como físicamente.</i><br/>

<h3>The Founding</h3>
<div>
<p>Your contribution will be allocated to :</p>
<p>• To pay for the costs of printing the book and the rewards (photographic prints).</p>
<p>• Once the donations are awarded, the rest of the money will go to the children's library in one of the refugees camps in Algeria.</p>
<p>This is the only source of funding. I choosed a flexible type of funding which means that even if I will not reach my goal I still will be able to print books and send the remaining money to the children's library in the camps. However more people will contribute the cost of printing will be cheaper and more money will be send to the camps. </p>

<p><i>Tu contribución será asignada: </i></p>
<p><i>• Para pagar los gastos de la impresión del libro y las recompensas (impresiones fotográficas). </i></p>
<p><i>• Una vez que las donaciones hayan sido asignadas, el resto del dinero se destinará a la biblioteca infantil en uno de los campamentos de refugiados en Argelia.</i></p>
<p><i>Esta es la única fuente de financiación. Elegí un tipo de financiación flexible que significa que aunque si no llegue a mi objetivo, aún seré capaz de imprimir libros y enviar el dinero restante para la biblioteca infantil en los campamentos.

<h3>The Impact </h3>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The aims of publishing this book are:</p>
<p>— to bring more awareness about situation in Western Sahara. I believe that unresolved conflict in Western Sahara in relatively unknown especially to people from english speaking countries and as the time passes the frustration between Saharawis grows -- it would be a shame if the only solution for resolving this forgotten conflict was returning to war.  </p>
<p>— to rise the money for the children's library in Bojador. I have contacted Sahara Bubisher <a href=""http://www.bubisher.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bubisher.org/</a> non profit organisation which helps to rise money for the libraries in the camps. They kindly support my project -- all the profit from that action will be sent to them. I will update information about how much money has been raised on that webpage as well as on my project's facebook webpage.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b><i>El  Impacto</i></b></p>
<p><i>Los objetivos de la publicación de este libro son:</i></p>
<p><i> -crear más conciencia acerca de la situación en el Sáhara Occidental. Creo que este conflicto sin resolver del Sáhara Occidental es relativamente desconocido, especialmente entre personas procedentes de países de habla inglesa, y ` medida que pasa más tiempo, la frustración entre los saharauis crece. Sería una lástima que la única solución para resolver este conflicto olvidado fuera la vuelta a la guerra.</i></p>

<p><i>- Aumentar el dinero para la biblioteca infantil en Bojador.

Breve Sumario
Este es un libro fotográfico sobre el pueblo saharaui que vive en campamentos de refugiados en Argelia. Este pueblo ha estado esperando 40 años para regresar a su patria el Sáhara Occidental, que está actualmente ocupada por los marroquíes. Con la ayuda de todos ustedes, quiero publicar un libro sobre ellos a través de crowdfunding, y enviar todas las ganancias de la venta a la biblioteca infantil en uno de los campamentos de refugiados en Argelia.




The Camps
The camps are located near Tindouf in Western Algeria. The place is called ""The Devil's Garden' and there is a reason for that -- the temperatures in summer can easily reach over 50 degrees C. There are 6 in total temporary settlements, refugee camps where live approximately 160,000 people surviving on aid from international community.
In 1975 the last African colony, Western Sahara has been invaded by Moroccans and many people has been forced to exile from their country. Even though under international law the invasion in 1975 was illegal and in 1991 Morocco agreed on referendum Saharawi people are still waiting for resolution for this conflict as well as for their referendum. 


Los Campamentos


Los campamentos se encuentran cerca de Tinduf en el occidente de Argelia. El lugar se llama ""El jardín del diablo"" y hay una razón para esto: las temperaturas en verano pueden llegar fácilmente a más de 50 grados C. Hay un total de 6 asentamientos temporales, campamentos de refugiados donde viven aproximadamente 160.000 personas que sobreviven con ayuda de la comunidad internacional. En 1975, la última colonia en África, el Sáhara Occidental, fue invadida por los marroquíes y mucha gente fue forzada a exiliarse de su país. Aunque, según el derecho internacional, la invasión de 1975 fue ilegal, y en 1991 Marruecos aceptó hacer un referéndum, el pueblo saharaui todavía está a la espera de la resolución de este conflicto, así como de su referéndum.




My Experience
I visited Sahrawi refugee camps in Sahara by a chance. I was exposed to a simple and harsh life people living there. My experience was so strong that just after a month I had to come back to the same place again. I  started to take quick snapshots  to capture just the experience of the moment of being there. Why I found the camps so fascinated? I guess the journeys changed my point of view on different things. Definitely taught me a lot about patience and human dignity. Was unforgettable journey both mentally and physically. 


Mi Experiencia


Visité los campamentos de refugiados saharauis en el desierto del Sáhara por casualidad. Estuve expuesto a la dura y simple vida de la gente que vive allí. Mi experiencia fue tan fuerte que sólo después de un mes tuve que volver al mismo lugar. Empecé a tomar rápidas instantáneas para capturar sólo la experiencia del momento de estar allí. ¿Por qué me parecieron tan fascinantes estos campamentos? Supongo que el viaje ha cambiado mi punto de vista sobre muchas cosas. Definitivamente me enseñó mucho sobre la paciencia y la dignidad humana. Fue un viaje inolvidable, tanto mental como físicamente.



 
The Book
The book will contain combination of the photographs from the camps as well as graphics created based on satellite images of the camps from the space. There are two tiltles of this book '40' which refers to the number of years the Saharawi people have been waiting to come back to their homeland and 'Place which does not exist' (in arabic) which refers to their current political status. Presented pictures are fruits of my recent trip to Sahrawi camps in Algeria.

The Founding

Your contribution will be allocated to :
• To pay for the costs of printing the book and the rewards (photographic prints).
• Once the donations are awarded, the rest of the money will go to the children's library in one of the refugees camps in Algeria.
This is the only source of funding. I choosed a flexible type of funding which means that even if I will not reach my goal I still will be able to print books and send the remaining money to the children's library in the camps. However more people will contribute the cost of printing will be cheaper and more money will be send to the camps. 

La Financiación

Tu contribución será asignada: 
• Para pagar los gastos de la impresión del libro y las recompensas (impresiones fotográficas). 
• Una vez que las donaciones hayan sido asignadas, el resto del dinero se destinará a la biblioteca infantil en uno de los campamentos de refugiados en Argelia.
Esta es la única fuente de financiación. Elegí un tipo de financiación flexible que significa que aunque si no llegue a mi objetivo, aún seré capaz de imprimir libros y enviar el dinero restante para la biblioteca infantil en los campamentos. Sin embargo, mientras  más gente contribuya con el costo de impresión, será más barato y se enviará más dinero a los campamentos.



   

The Impact 


The aims of publishing this book are:
— to bring more awareness about situation in Western Sahara. I believe that unresolved conflict in Western Sahara in relatively unknown especially to people from english speaking countries and as the time passes the frustration between Saharawis grows -- it would be a shame if the only solution for resolving this forgotten conflict was returning to war.  
— to rise the money for the children's library in Bojador. I have contacted Sahara Bubisher http://www.bubisher.org/ non profit organisation which helps to rise money for the libraries in the camps. They kindly support my project -- all the profit from that action will be sent to them. I will update information about how much money has been raised on that webpage as well as on my project's facebook webpage.  



El  Impacto
Los objetivos de la publicación de este libro son:
 -crear más conciencia acerca de la situación en el Sáhara Occidental. Creo que este conflicto sin resolver del Sáhara Occidental es relativamente desconocido, especialmente entre personas procedentes de países de habla inglesa, y ` medida que pasa más tiempo, la frustración entre los saharauis crece. Sería una lástima que la única solución para resolver este conflicto olvidado fuera la vuelta a la guerra.



- Aumentar el dinero para la biblioteca infantil en Bojador. Me he puesto en contacto con Sahara Bubisher http://www.bubisher.org/, una organización sin fines de lucro que ayuda a recoger el dinero para las bibliotecas en los campamentos.  Bubisher está apoyando mi proyecto. Todas las ganancias de esta acción serán enviadas a esta organización. Actualizaré la información de cuánto dinero se ha recogido en su página web, así como también en mi proyecto de página de Facebook.

<h3>My Story <br/>
</h3>
<p>Hi, I am a travel writer and photographer from Canada.  I have been working in Latin America for the past 2 years carrying the moniker that travel is safe, and that the world is a good place full of honest people.  Well, the other day my world came crashing down.  While on a bus from Quito, Ecuador to Tena, Ecuador I was robbed of all my camera gear, a value of over $3,000.  The worst part?  My travel insurance won't cover anything since I bought the gear outside of Canada, and because each item stolen was over $500 in value.  If you want to read about the story you can do so here on my website: <a href=""http://www.brendansadventures.com/i-was-robbed-im-going-to-puke/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.brendansadventures.com/i-was-robbed-im-going-to-puke/</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Obviously I'm devastated. Losing your livelihood is not easy, and it's even more difficult for me.  I am a working nomad.  I have no possessions.  I own a laptop, a website, a digital travel magazine, and I used to own some camera gear. That camera gear was basically 75% of my physical property value.  I guess for many it would be like losing their house, or being fired from their job.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without a camera I am out of work.  More over, I have lost the opportunity to inspire others through my work.  My website is host to hundreds of visitors, sometimes thousands, a day who come to see my work.  Without a camera I have lost my ability to express how I view the world.  Despite this unfortunate situation I still see the world in a positive light, and I still want to shot people how beautiful the world is that we live in. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have already raised $700 through friends, family members, and readers of my website which is amazing.  However to do my job properly I need the following items.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Canon 60d Body: $899</li>
<li>Canon 70-200mm f/4 lens: $1300</li>
<li>Either a Canon 17-40mm: $799 or Canon 15-85mm: 699$</li>
</ul>
<div>Honestly, if I can raise enough for just a lens to put on that body I would be overwhelmed with thanks.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As I've outlined on my website article, you don't need to donate, I'm more than willing to sell a product related to me as well.  I have calendars, photo prints, and some other things listed on my article at the bottom: <a href=""http://www.brendansadventures.com/i-was-robbed-im-going-to-puke/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.brendansadventures.com/i-was-robbed-im-going-to-puke/</a>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Obviously if you can't help out financially I completely understand, however I would love for you to release the social media wave for me.  Even the smallest thing, such as a tweet on twitter or a like on facebook will go a long way.  I truly appreciate anything you can do to help.  Yesterday, the support I got through my website was outstanding.  I'd be lying if I said that this robbery didn't shake my view on people, but the support I have been given through this process has solidified my belief that this world is a great place full of amazing and caring people.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Political
background:</h3> <p></p>
<p>We are from Latvia, and, in the first half
of 2015, Latvia is the presiding country in Council of the European Union,
and thus it organises and promotes its official culture programme in a number
of European cities.</p> </div> <div> <h3>
Our
wish:</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>Along with the national culture programme, to
participate with our alternative offer that is not an academic expression of
art,</p>
<h4>while the main things is  </h4>
<p>to show our daily life, routine and
holidays, to present Latvia and Riga from a simple and usual point of view to
the audience, and show how people live, what they do, how they enjoy life, what
is the truth as seen from the inside</p>
<h4>with an objective</h4>
<p>to show to a wider audience that we are not
frightened and underdeveloped post-soviet province, to arouse interest, to give
positive impressions about Latvia, and to show the conjunctive and different
aspects of social life and culture.</p><p>
</p><h4>We offer:</h4>
<p>to demonstrate both documentation of
history facts and creative view of the author with photographs of the single
author.</p>

<h3>Expression
of the travelling exhibition:</h3> <p> </p>
<p>in each visited city, a photo collection is
exposed just for a day thus making the event a recurrent opening of the
exhibition with maximum publicity in each place.</p>
<h4>Our
accomplishments:</h4>
<p>In September 2014, we started
organisational work carrying out a questionnaire with 30 European
countries on a possibility to arrange such exhibition. We have received quite
many approving answers to in fact plan the touring exhibition in 17 cities
in 12 countries.</p>
<p>We have prepared the exhibition’s
exposition and structures to be built, and currently we are booking
accommodations and clarifying the touring details.</p>
<p>We are also working on issuing a photo
album of the author, and the album is foreseen to be offered to the interested
ones in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>Currently we are also developing a special
homepage to present the exhibition’s tour, share opinions and publish the offer
of the photo album.</p>

Where
we faced challenges:</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>we didn’t receive the expected help from
organisations that would actually be interested in creation of the public image
of Latvia;</p>
<p>many commercial companies refuse support as
they see no immediate financial return of the invested assets.</p><p><br/></p><p>
</p><h3>What can we do?</h3>
<p>We are turning to you asking for support
and hoping that</p>
<p>our project is interesting and useful to
public;</p>
<p>our private initiative in creative exchange
of cross-national culture has deserved the public support.</p>

<h3>About the author:</h3>
<p>Irena Petra, a street photographer from
Latvia: </p>
<p><i>“EVERY DAY THERE ARE THINGS AND EVENTS AROUND US, WHICH WE JUST DON’T SEE
OR NOTICE, WE PASS THEM BY, BEING BUSY AS WE ARE, AND WE ARE SURPRISED WHEN WE
SEE ORDINARY AND USUAL THINGS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, THROUGH THE EYES OF
A PHOTOGRAPHER.”</i></p>
<p>Irena has begun her creative work in the
1980s with professional dancing and painting, later turning to graphic design,
graphic work and book illustrations, participating in the exhibitions of group
of artists Free Art in Riga.  Her works
can be found in private collections in Germany, Israel, Russia and Latvia.</p>
<p>Later, working as an image editor at a
publishing house, Irena got into photography, first as a photo correspondent,
but later it evolved into her private project Riga Collection.  It consists of documentary, ambience and
observational photos of Riga and has been going on and developing since 2008.</p>
<p>The photos in the collection have been on
public display at Irena's personal exhibitions in Riga in 2011, 2012, 2013 and
2014.</p>
<p>Irena does not publish her photo collection
on the Internet and it can only be seen at her exhibitions and in her coming
printed photo album.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1276202/files/20150307095604-Book-204.jpg?1425750964"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1276203/files/20150307095637-Book-203.jpg?1425750997"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1276204/files/20150307095703-Book-202.jpg?1425751023"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1276205/files/20150307095724-Book-201.jpg?1425751044"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

to organise a travelling exhibition:

when an exhibition is in premises, only the

Political
background: 
We are from Latvia, and, in the first half
of 2015, Latvia is the presiding country in Council of the European Union,
and thus it organises and promotes its official culture programme in a number
of European cities.   
Our
wish: 

Along with the national culture programme, to
participate with our alternative offer that is not an academic expression of
art,
while the main things is  
to show our daily life, routine and
holidays, to present Latvia and Riga from a simple and usual point of view to
the audience, and show how people live, what they do, how they enjoy life, what
is the truth as seen from the inside
with an objective
to show to a wider audience that we are not
frightened and underdeveloped post-soviet province, to arouse interest, to give
positive impressions about Latvia, and to show the conjunctive and different
aspects of social life and culture.
We offer:
to demonstrate both documentation of
history facts and creative view of the author with photographs of the single
author.

Expression
of the travelling exhibition:  
in each visited city, a photo collection is
exposed just for a day thus making the event a recurrent opening of the
exhibition with maximum publicity in each place.
Our
accomplishments:
In September 2014, we started
organisational work carrying out a questionnaire with 30 European
countries on a possibility to arrange such exhibition. We have received quite
many approving answers to in fact plan the touring exhibition in 17 cities
in 12 countries.
We have prepared the exhibition’s
exposition and structures to be built, and currently we are booking
accommodations and clarifying the touring details.
We are also working on issuing a photo
album of the author, and the album is foreseen to be offered to the interested
ones in the second half of this year.
Currently we are also developing a special
homepage to present the exhibition’s tour, share opinions and publish the offer
of the photo album.


   
Where
we faced challenges: 

we didn’t receive the expected help from
organisations that would actually be interested in creation of the public image
of Latvia;
many commercial companies refuse support as
they see no immediate financial return of the invested assets.
What can we do?
We are turning to you asking for support
and hoping that
our project is interesting and useful to
public;
our private initiative in creative exchange
of cross-national culture has deserved the public support.

About the author:
Irena Petra, a street photographer from
Latvia: 
“EVERY DAY THERE ARE THINGS AND EVENTS AROUND US, WHICH WE JUST DON’T SEE
OR NOTICE, WE PASS THEM BY, BEING BUSY AS WE ARE, AND WE ARE SURPRISED WHEN WE
SEE ORDINARY AND USUAL THINGS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, THROUGH THE EYES OF
A PHOTOGRAPHER.”
Irena has begun her creative work in the
1980s with professional dancing and painting, later turning to graphic design,
graphic work and book illustrations, participating in the exhibitions of group
of artists Free Art in Riga.  Her works
can be found in private collections in Germany, Israel, Russia and Latvia.
Later, working as an image editor at a
publishing house, Irena got into photography, first as a photo correspondent,
but later it evolved into her private project Riga Collection.  It consists of documentary, ambience and
observational photos of Riga and has been going on and developing since 2008.
The photos in the collection have been on
public display at Irena's personal exhibitions in Riga in 2011, 2012, 2013 and
2014.
Irena does not publish her photo collection
on the Internet and it can only be seen at her exhibitions and in her coming
printed photo album.
Run of the tour:
The expected length of the tour is
40 days, namely, one day is dedicated to the exhibition, while the other – to
travelling to the next place.  Our touring
team consists of three members.  We are planning to go to the tour from May to June 2015.

The tour includes 7,000 km and

Construction of metal structures of the
exhibition stands  3,000 €
Tour trip (fuel, accommodation, food)                                     12,000

We invest our money in organisation of the

</div><p><br/></p><h2>About the project</h2><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I'm a 22 year old photographer. My dream to travel and share my vision of our world have started since my first steps in photography. I have worked hard to make this dream come true with my own budget and to start to report what was in front of me, sharing the truth about life, about a reality happening every day for some people, about social facts and human condition. About our environment, and how people live in this.</span><br/>

<br/><p>My dream project started on the 4 December 2014 when I boarded my flight for Manila, starting this project in the Philippines. Until today, i have taken pictures almost every day, I have heard, seen and captured many interesting, crazy and sad stories. I seek to capture the beauty everywhere, even if sometimes this kind of beauty can hurt. Even if the truth can hurt. The most important thing for me is to share that. Share their stories.</p>
<p></p>

<i><br/></i><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The problem is that in Asia the weather and climate can change very fast. My professional camera 5D mark II, which I have had for 4 years, has survived in a lot of hard conditions (Typhon, a lot of rain, sand, humidity, and rain again ) But unfortunately it broke down today beyond repair, while I am just half-way through my journey to explore and capture Asia’s truth. Unfortunately without my camera my project is in peril. I have already taken arrangements for the rest of the journey but can’t imagine continuing without a camera. In my tight budget I had not prepared the eventuality to invest in new material. And I have actually sold my second camera one month ago to prolong my project.</span><i><span><br/></span></i></p>
<p>So, I ask your help, if you can of course, to help me finish this project.</p>

</div></div>","Project aim
Helping a young photographer to replace his broken camera half way through working on his dream project to capture life and the true Asia.
About the project
I'm a 22 year old photographer. My dream to travel and share my vision of our world have started since my first steps in photography. I have worked hard to make this dream come true with my own budget and to start to report what was in front of me, sharing the truth about life, about a reality happening every day for some people, about social facts and human condition. About our environment, and how people live in this.
Jakarta / indonésia 
My dream project started on the 4 December 2014 when I boarded my flight for Manila, starting this project in the Philippines. Until today, i have taken pictures almost every day, I have heard, seen and captured many interesting, crazy and sad stories. I seek to capture the beauty everywhere, even if sometimes this kind of beauty can hurt. Even if the truth can hurt. The most important thing for me is to share that. Share their stories.


Manila (railway) / Philippines

The problem is that in Asia the weather and climate can change very fast. My professional camera 5D mark II, which I have had for 4 years, has survived in a lot of hard conditions (Typhon, a lot of rain, sand, humidity, and rain again ) But unfortunately it broke down today beyond repair, while I am just half-way through my journey to explore and capture Asia’s truth. Unfortunately without my camera my project is in peril. I have already taken arrangements for the rest of the journey but can’t imagine continuing without a camera. In my tight budget I had not prepared the eventuality to invest in new material. And I have actually sold my second camera one month ago to prolong my project.
So, I ask your help, if you can of course, to help me finish this project.

However, with the (financial) realities of life, we've never splurged for one of high enough quality to really pursue her interest. <br/><br/><strong>This last year two things happened:</strong><br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>We had a beautiful baby girl!</li>
</ul><p><br/>       And <br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Our point and shoot camera went bye-bye.</li>
</ul><p><br/>So, I'm calling all friends and family (<em>and all friends of friends and family</em>) to join me in getting her a camera worthy of her interest (<em>and of our daughter's beautiful smile</em>).<br/><br/>The camera she would love (<em>we recently borrowed one</em>) is over $700.00 new. I would love to wow her with a gift like that. And I'd love your help. <br/><br/>Everyone who pitches in will be listed in the birthday card I give her, and if you provide email addresses, I'll see to it you get a beautiful pic of my family taken with the birthday camera (<em>or one of my short stories in e-book format if you'd prefer... or both!</em>).<br/><br/>So... What say you? Will you join me in making her birthday special?</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A few more details:</strong></p>
<p>Although I put the end date as April 4th, that's just because IndieGoGo required me to. My wife's Birthday is March 27 (<em>that's only 10</em> days) and this idea just occurred to me. So, although it's short notice, I'd love to let her know about it on her birthday even if the money takes longer for IndieGoGo to drop in the account.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The camera I'm looking at for her is the Nikon D5100 which ranges from right at $700 to more than $900 depending on lense kits. I picked $830 because that will give her roughly $770 after IndieGoGo fees---which should cover the camera with a basic lense.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't make the goal, but get close, I'm looking at getting her the Nikon D3100 (<em>still a rocking camera that she would love</em>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And if we really don't get near the goal, but collect a couple hundred, I'm looking at having her pick out a Point and Shoot camera of her choice---because currently she's limited to her cell phone camera... and her phone is old :o)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So there it is. Your help in making her day would be amazingly appreciated!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Love you all!</p>

I grew up in Canada, in the province of Saskatchewan, where I was a visible minority, a Chinese living in a small town where I could count the number of Asian families on one hand. I studied both fine arts and architecture and lived in Toronto for 10 years before making the move to live in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, I worked as an architect for nearly 5 years, but found that my deeper interest was in photography and art.</p><p><b>*</b><br/></p><p><b>THE ASIAN MALE - 3.AM - A NEW BOOK PUBLICATION </b></p><p>I am raising funds to print and publish my third photography book of Asian men nudes and semi-nudes entitled <i>The Asian Male - 3.AM</i>. All the images are already taken, having collected them over a period of seven years. The layout and design is 95% complete and the foreword has been written by Amazon.com Hall of Fame reviewer Grady Harp. Below is the the cover of the book, who is modeled by the exotic Filipino, Nono. </p><p><i>Sample layouts (work in progress)</i></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/662013/files/20140619230049-Sample_Layout_Indiegogo.jpg?1403244049"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><b>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</b></p><p></p><p>After seeing my friend Derek Lam, a graphic designer, publish a book on Asian men, I thought I could do the same. I learned photography at the age of 12 the old-fashioned way using black and white film and a darkroom. At the gym in Hong Kong, I had many friends that had really great physiques, and thought I could practice shooting while trying to emulate the style of Herb Ritts, an American photographer who captured stunning images of beautiful men and women. The nude work that he did with Japanese soccer player Kazu inspired me greatly. <br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">After shooting a number of guys, I found that my own photography both disappointed and excited me. I found that I could not copy Herb Ritts and his photos of muscular guys. Instead, I discovered my own style of photography, which then set the tone for my Asian male publications. I contacted several well known publishers, but none came back to me with a positive response. In the end, I decided to go about doing it on my own and set up Studio 8 HK as a small publishing company. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>*</b><br/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 23.200000762939453px;""><b>MY FIRST BOOK</b></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Asian-Male-Norm-Yip/dp/9889825910%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJXSASYULD5X3K5WA%26tag%3Dnoryiptheoffw-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D9889825910"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Asian Male - 1.AM</a></i> became my first self-published book.

<p></p></div>","ABOUT MEMy name is Norm Yip and I’m an artist and photographer. I grew up in Canada, in the province of Saskatchewan, where I was a visible minority, a Chinese living in a small town where I could count the number of Asian families on one hand. I studied both fine arts and architecture and lived in Toronto for 10 years before making the move to live in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, I worked as an architect for nearly 5 years, but found that my deeper interest was in photography and art.*THE ASIAN MALE - 3.AM - A NEW BOOK PUBLICATION I am raising funds to print and publish my third photography book of Asian men nudes and semi-nudes entitled The Asian Male - 3.AM. All the images are already taken, having collected them over a period of seven years. The layout and design is 95% complete and the foreword has been written by Amazon.com Hall of Fame reviewer Grady Harp. Below is the the cover of the book, who is modeled by the exotic Filipino, Nono. Sample layouts (work in progress)HOW IT ALL BEGANAfter seeing my friend Derek Lam, a graphic designer, publish a book on Asian men, I thought I could do the same. I learned photography at the age of 12 the old-fashioned way using black and white film and a darkroom. At the gym in Hong Kong, I had many friends that had really great physiques, and thought I could practice shooting while trying to emulate the style of Herb Ritts, an American photographer who captured stunning images of beautiful men and women. The nude work that he did with Japanese soccer player Kazu inspired me greatly. After shooting a number of guys, I found that my own photography both disappointed and excited me. I found that I could not copy Herb Ritts and his photos of muscular guys. Instead, I discovered my own style of photography, which then set the tone for my Asian male publications. I contacted several well known publishers, but none came back to me with a positive response. In the end, I decided to go about doing it on my own and set up Studio 8 HK as a small publishing company. *MY FIRST BOOKThe Asian Male - 1.AM became my first self-published book. The '1' stands for first edition; the 'A' for Asian and finally the 'M' for Male. That was in 2005. I hired a friend to help with the layout and design. I handled all the distribution and promoting on my own, learning how to put together a proper press release, and contacted as many bookstores across the US in hopes of taking on my book. MY SECOND BOOKA short two years later, I published my second book The Asian Male - 2.AM which included a more diverse range of men. The selection of guys were Koreans, Nepalese, Malaysians, Indians, Filipino, and Chinese. It further demonstrated that Asian men could be appreciated aesthetically for their inherent qualities, making the lean muscular build ideally attractive as an subject and object of art. MY THIRD BOOK 3.AMWell, its now 2014, and I’m ready to print and publish The Asian Male - 3.AM. The 3rd edition will showcase the best photographs of guys in the past 7 years. The majority of the images are in black and white and shot mostly in my Hong Kong studio. The ethnic range includes Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Japanese, Cambodian and Chinese. Bodies range from the super masculine and hard bodied men such as Vietnamese Jeremy Tang, to the softer and lyrical body of Nono, a young and exceptionally photogenic Filipino. Then there is Malaysian-Chinese Derek Chong, who I photographed several times both nude and with fashion accessories. The images celebrate and bring to the forefront the beauty of Asian men in a erotic and sensuous way. There are semi-nudes to nudes in this book, but it is all photographed in a sensitive and sensual way. The men that appear come from all areas of life, including financial advisors, dancers and performers, professional models and more. These photographs are portraits of people just like anyone else; they are proud of who they are as Asian men, but also proud to be able to express their own beauty. It was a chance for them to be admired and appreciated in an artistic way, without the fear of being seen as vulgar or unruly, especially within the Asian community as a whole. Although Asian is progressing, there is still a huge stigma to nudity and the body as a whole.*THE BOOKThe book will be 9 x 12"" sized book with over 100 pages. The inside pages will be printed on 178gsm Art Matt paper. Meanwhile the cover will be in black with silver foil stamping, with a laminated Jacket. (Pictured below is a soft-cover dummy copy, but rest assured, the final printed book will be a hard-cover book.) The book's design, layout, cover, and jacket is designed by me. FINE ART PRINTSThe photographs you see below have been carefully selected to appear on the Indiegogo campaign, whereby the Asian male has been interpreted as fine art images. They are as follows: Nono - No. 1, Nono - No. 2, Calvin, Monika, Nathan, Ricky, and Wilfred. They will be available in various sizes to fit: a) 8 x 12"" (Edition of 10)b) 13 x 17"" (Edition of 10)c) 16 x 24"", (Edition of 10)d) 24 x 36"" (Edition of 5)The fine art prints will be printed on Fine Art Matt paper, signed and numbered. Each print will be accompanied by a Certificate of Authenticity. Nono, No. 1, Filipino, Hong KongNono, No. 2, Filipino, Hong KongCalvin, Chinese, SingaporeMonika, Albanian-Cambodian, USARicky, Chinese, Hong KongNathan, Chinese, Hong KongWilfred, Chinese, Hong Kong*BE A PATRONThose purchasing artwork through the listed Perks will have an opportunity to be acknowledged in the book publication as Patrons. GOLD PATRON- purchase of US$2,500 or more of artworkSILVER PATRON- purchase of US$1,250 or more of artworkBRONZE PATRON- purchase of US$625 or more of artwork*HOW THE FUNDS BE USEDYour pre-order copy or purchase of a limited edition print along with a book will help fund the cost of printing 1,500 books, which amounts to US$20,000. This will cover costs for color proofs, editing, the foreword, proofing, and part of the shipping costs to the USA where my wholesaler is based. The printing of the book publication will be done in Hong Kong, where I will be conducting press checks, to ensure quality control of the printing from start to finish. The goal amount however does not cover any pre-productions costs, studio hours, post-production work on the images, nor the hours of graphic design work that I have spent on the book publication and the promotion thereof. *PRESS/MEDIASouth China Morning Post - Photographer hopes to score with body of works by Kylie KnottTimeout Magazine - Norm Yip's Asian Male Photography by Arthur TamDaniel Magazine - Photographing the Inner and Outer Beauty of the Asian Male by Helen Zhao*WEBSITES & FACEBOOKThe Asian Male - 3.AM Blog - http://theasianmale3am.wordpress.comThe Asian Male Project - http://theasianmale.com

El domingo de la semana
pasada, David Herranz (davidherranz.com)
–y su consorte- salieron de casa, a mediodía, con intención de mendigar un
plato de sopa en casa de sus suegros. 
Tras disfrutar de una opípara comida, una
siesta eterna, diversos chistes malos y un café con pastas de Lidl, volvieron al
hogar y casi les da un chungo cuando vieron que alguien había entrado.
Todo estaba
revuelto: cajones abiertos, ropa por el suelo, desorden, caos… El ordenador seguía ahí, el ipad, el
televisor… ¿No se habían llevado nada?
Sí, la mochila de
David… con todo el equipo
fotográfico.Se
habían llevado su herramienta de trabajo.

¡Estamos hablando de 11.000 euros en equipo!
11.000 euros que no tiene... Porque es autónomo, porque la crisis nos está jodiendo a todos y, sobre todo, porque a David le pone muy cachondo hacer favores y currar sin cobrar, o cobrando poco…

Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes
Y ésa es la razón por la que el recién creado COMITÉ DE COLEGAS MONGERS hemos decidido montar este tinglado: necesitamos que David vuelva a tener un equipo... para que siga haciéndonos favores.
Esto no es caridad. Esto es devolverle un poco de lo que nos ha dado.
El COMITÉ propone una suma de 6000 euros. Seis mil eurillos destinados íntegramente a la compra de material fotográfico.
Pero, ¡ojo! Si llegamos a los 11.000 euros, David Herranz posará desnudo. Él aún no lo sabe, pero todos sabemos cómo es David cuando bebe.
Y si superamos los 11.000, el COMITÉ se compromete a organizar un fiestón como nunca antes se ha visto en… por ahí.
David se encargará del PhotoCall, o como se diga.
Así que si eres uno de tantos a los que David ofreció su talento de forma desinteresada… no seas zanguango y ráscate el bolsillo. Y si no le conoces de nada, piensa en el KARMA y suelta un poco de calderilla, que todo suma.
Pero, como diría Super Ratón, ""aún hay más"": estamos que lo tiramos… y aquí toda acción tiene su reacción. Es decir, que cada donación tendrá su recompensa:
Por 25 euros, recibirás una chapa con la cara de David, modificada con Photoshop para que parezca José Luis Moreno cuando lo hostiaron en su casa.
Si sueltas 100 euritos te llevarás un disco de los Dead Bronco, firmado.
Por 200 euros, una foto firmada por David Herranz.

How will I receive my Glo3D app for the exclusive first release? On the schedule date, we will send you an email invite to download your app directly onto your smartphone.

Does your light box come with a setup instruction manual? All of our light boxes come with a tutorial video and a paper instruction to ensure seamless user experience when setting up for the first time.

Can I use the Glo3D app with my existing hardware? Yes. Our Glo3D 360 product photography mobile app is compatible with any manual/motorized rotating stands and light boxes. 

How do I claim my Glo3D app credit? The Glo3D app credit can be used towards future subscription for additional enhancement features and will automatically be added to your Glo3D account once it's set up.

What is your solution to deal with delays? The foreseeable risk associated with this project would be the fulfillment of the hardware to our backers on the planned scheduled dates due to manufacturer challenges. Our solution to help minimize and mitigate this is the use of Shipwire to outsource fulfillment and Ship Station to help with shipping logistics. Lastly, we would provide our supporters with regular updates on the status of their deliveries with complete transparency if a delay is to be expected.

Is your 360 product photography app compatible with any smartphone? Our Glo3D app is compatible with iPhones that have at least an iOS verion 10.3 and Android 6, 7, 8 (over 1400 android devices).

If my hardware or package is damaged, what is your company's exchange or return policy? For any damaged or defected hardware, Glo3D will send out a new replacement at NO COST to the backer and will also cover the return of the original damaged or defected hardware.

Is your hardware compatible with the European and International voltage standards? Our Glo3D hardware is currently supporting only US Voltage standard. Backers from European and International countries are responsible in ensuring the hardware works with the voltage standard of their countries.

What is the cost of international shipping? This would be dependent on the destination country and the total weight of your perks.

<p>My passion and service to the world is to highlight all beauty. Sometimes when breast cancer strikes a woman’s life, it can turn her world upside down. Her self-worth and self-image can be shattered.

<p>It is my deep desire and quest to offer my photography services for free to women with breast cancer all over the country and beyond. I want to highlight their wholeness by capturing an artistic picture of them to remind them that they are still indeed beautiful. This is an offering of healing through art.</p>
<p>I am here  to seek donations to enable me to set out on this journey.

It's been almost a year since I decided to head to London on a creative adventure.  

I wanted to know what I would find within myself creatively, post-motherhood, shooting on the quirky streets of London. And so I asked you - my friends, family and Indiegogo benefactors - to help me get there.


The campaign was a success! I raised enough for at least a few months in London, plus money to send postcards and prints to everyone who donated.



I'm happy to say that the project - and my whole life - blossomed into more than I ever imagined.

What I found in my street photography has been very exciting to me personally and I continue to explore the streets of London and other cities and towns in England.


I also found love and a new life here and plan to eventually settle in England with my lovely partner.



I have spent the last year in England shooting this project while on a tourist visa, which means that I have been unable to work and have relied on the generosity of friends and family to get by. This includes the money that you and others so kindly donated last year through Indiegogo, and for that I give many thanks!

The Plan

I will be having an exhibit of my street photography at Alley Cat Gallery in San Francisco during the second half of September and I am back on Indiegogo to ask for your help. 


Printing and framing for a show can be very expensive, so I have decided not to frame the photos and will instead make large poster-size prints as well as smaller prints that can be displayed in grids and rows. This will keep the cost down, and also make for a dynamic presentation of the images.


This money will also cover the costs of printing and shipping prints to you, my Indiegogo benefactors. Be sure to have a look at the perks I am offering in exchange for your donations!

</div></div>","The DetailsHi, my name is Mandy-Lyn. I’m a photographer and deejay from east Vancouver, Canada. I shoot all my photographs with a 35mm film camera and Kodak 400 film. My photos look to captivate the wild, free spirited nature of rock n roll and the charm and total magic of the female form though it’s imperishable sexuality. My erotic analog portraits have been an ongoing self funded series over the last five years. Play will be my first collected book of nude portraits. This crowd-sourcing campaign will fund the expense of producing the book as well as a limited ‘First Edition’ that will be available to sponsors of the project.Of my most recent press, In May 2014 I shared a photo exhibition at Known Gallery in Los Angeles with fellow photographer Teen Witch (Andrea Sonnenberg) where I exhibited 50 collected portraits of my incredible female friends, shot over the past seven years. I collaborated with Altamont Apparel on a tee-shirt collection called Rock N Roll Suicides (Spring 2015); four tributes to legendary Rockers with exciting young women as the muse. Prior to that I directed and filmed a video short called Malibu for HUF Worldwide in a tribute to Sharon Tate’s performance in 1966’s Don’t Make Waves - 12 California girls on a trampoline on the shore of Malibu beach.

My portraits have been featured in publications such as Juxtapoz, VICE, Color Magazine, POSI+TIVE, Dazed & Confused, DiCE, Vogue Italia, Sad Magazine and ION. See me shooting some photographs for an editorial in Color Magazine here.See my Altamont interview with Patrick O'Dell here.

Play is an intimate, super-natural experience with female sexuality. Sprung from some long conversations with a close friend and feminist author Mish Way (who will write the introduction), the idea developed through a print feature shoot for Penthouse Magazine: sun soaked analog nudes played through the spectacular untouched environments of the Pacific Northwest Coast. From ocean to river, from mountain to forest to field, Play brings the viewer on a nymph’s adventure to the most natural spaces; places of peace, comfort, joy and timelessness. By sponsoring this project you are doing far more than simply helping me to make a book. You’re supporting my artistic endeavour totally; helping me to fulfill a dream of seeing and sharing positive and empowering sexual content with a growing community of viewers. The hope that is carried in the heart of Play is for a healthier social review of sexual equality and freedom. Explore my photographs at Mandy-Lyn.com!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Did you know that testicular cancer kills more men under the age of 30 than women with breast cancer? My hope is that this project educates the world about the leading cancer of men ages 15 - 35.  I want to give HOPE and RECOGNITION to all victims and survivors of testicular cancer. The Sneakers Book Project will do just that... give HOPE and RECOGNITION to these great men by funding research initiatives to testicular cancer.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everyday a man is diagnosed with testicular cancer.  If treated and detected early, testicular cancer victims are often cured.  You can make a difference in a young man's life today with your contribution. The ultimate path to reduce the death rate from testicular cancer is through awareness and early detection.</p>

I'm Joshua Touster, a professional freelance photographer documenting this world of ours through my camera lens. Aftermath: The Boston Marathon Bombings is a photographic journey through the makeshift memorials, the lockdown, the crime scenes, and the Red Sox victory parade. The book documents the first anniversary of the bombings, the two subsequent Boston Marathons, One Boston Day, the trial of perpetrator Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the construction of permanent memorials to the victims. The book begins with my introductory
essay and Boston Globe reporter David Abel's eyewitness account of the moment when the bombs exploded. It concludes with an in-depth
chronology of all relevant events.
This project was personal. I live in Watertown, Massachusetts, one of

<p>Ever since I first laid eyes on photos taken from a recreational drone, I've been completely captivated with the unexplored possibilities.  After saving up and convincing myself the purchase would be worth the investment, I took the leap and acquired a DJI Phantom 4 drone.  The first time I sent this small robot four hundred feet into the air and looked through the view on my phone, I felt a swarm of butterflies in my stomach.  It was a mix of excitement at the astonishing view, with a dash of fear resulting from this expensive piece of equipment I just purchased soaring across the sky.  I knew immediately that I wanted to share these views with as many people as possible.  I created an Instagram page to share my favorite shots.  I went out every weekend to explore a new state park with my robot companion in tow.   I printed out the 80 page study guide provided by the Federal Aviation Administration and got to work on prepping for my unmanned pilots license.  Now six months later I've gathered a reasonable sized following, built up a portfolio of content, passed my FAA exam  (which allows me to fly for the sake of making money), and booked my first revenue while shooting for a real-estate construction story by a local newspaper.  That video was showcased to over a thousand community leaders at a local event.  </p>
