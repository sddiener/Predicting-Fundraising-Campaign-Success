<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">How it works:</b><br/></p>
<p>Healthy Kids - Healthy You is powered by a sophisticated
computer system created by <b>NutriStyle</b> that makes it easy to create menu plans
for you and your family. It features the foods you like from the grocery store
where you shop. It even provides you a shopping list, lets you include your
favorite recipes, and helps you track and adjust for things such as weight
goals, activity levels and food restrictions. You can even train it so it knows
your food likes and dislikes. </p>
<p><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">""This highly flexible, multi-layered approach to generating menus acknowledges that every individual is unique. It blows the cookie cutter approach of other systems away”.  Steve Kinsley - Registered Dietitian</i><br/></p>
<p><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Our goal:</b><br/></p>
<p>Through support from people just like you, we want to
introduce our Healthy Kids- Healthy You program and the NutriStyle
engine <b>FREE OF CHARGE</b> to those who are on the front lines of nutrition. This
includes school leaders, agency staff and young families. With your support,
we’ll do the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Reach
out to PTAs where parents and school leaders can share this exciting tool with
families.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Reach
out to agency counselors through programs like the popular Women, Infants and
Children program so they can provide this tool to their clients.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Secure
the involvement of grocery stores to help us connect this tool to schools and
families in your community.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With your support, we’ll be able to provide a Spanish
version of the application.  We are confident
that the Healthy Kids - Healthy You program will help Latino families achieve a
more balanced and healthy diet. Latino leaders tell us this family-friendly
program will help reverse rising obesity and diabetes rates and help the
nation’s 50+ million Latinos achieve a better quality of life.</p></span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/780529/files/20140811122204-HKHY_Kids_1.jpg?1407784924"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/><br/></p><p></p><p>We are working diligently to introduce Healthy Kids - Healthy You as early as possible for this school year.  You can help us accomplish our ambitious

</div></div>","Help ZING ZAP Childhood Obesity



ZING knows we have a problem and together we can do something about it.
One-in-three children and two-in-three adults are overweight or obese, and 79 million are pre-diabetic.
These aren’t just statistics.  These are your friends, family, children, and perhaps even you. 
About 90 percent of our $3 trillion healthcare bill is directly attributed to PREVENTABLE conditions – conditions that one out of two people currently face.
ZING's job is to let kids and their families know about the FREE revolutionary new tool that can help  solve this problem. 
With your support, TODAY is the beginning of a new chapter to restoring health and wellness. 
We are delighted to announce Healthy Kids - Healthy You™, a program to help busy families take
a healthy leap forward in improving their family wellness.
Healthy Kids–Healthy You is made possible through a partnership
of leading organizations, beginning with NutriStyle™, a technology company that
helps people quickly and painlessly balance nutrition with lifestyle goals. NutriStyle is joined by Building Healthier America, Produce for Better Health Foundation, Consolidar
and the prestigious American Council on
Exercise.

We are
committed to bringing Healthy Kids–Healthy You to you and your community, no
matter what.  But with your help we can
do it much sooner.  Help us make Healthy Kids–Healthy You available for the 2014-15 school year. 
Join ZING in Hawaii!!!!
How it works:
Healthy Kids - Healthy You is powered by a sophisticated
computer system created by NutriStyle that makes it easy to create menu plans
for you and your family. It features the foods you like from the grocery store
where you shop. It even provides you a shopping list, lets you include your
favorite recipes, and helps you track and adjust for things such as weight
goals, activity levels and food restrictions. You can even train it so it knows
your food likes and dislikes. 
""This highly flexible, multi-layered approach to generating menus acknowledges that every individual is unique. It blows the cookie cutter approach of other systems away”.  Steve Kinsley - Registered Dietitian
Our goal:
Through support from people just like you, we want to
introduce our Healthy Kids- Healthy You program and the NutriStyle
engine FREE OF CHARGE to those who are on the front lines of nutrition. This
includes school leaders, agency staff and young families. With your support,
we’ll do the following:



Reach
out to PTAs where parents and school leaders can share this exciting tool with
families.


Reach
out to agency counselors through programs like the popular Women, Infants and
Children program so they can provide this tool to their clients.


Secure
the involvement of grocery stores to help us connect this tool to schools and
families in your community.


With your support, we’ll be able to provide a Spanish
version of the application.  We are confident
that the Healthy Kids - Healthy You program will help Latino families achieve a
more balanced and healthy diet. Latino leaders tell us this family-friendly
program will help reverse rising obesity and diabetes rates and help the
nation’s 50+ million Latinos achieve a better quality of life.We are working diligently to introduce Healthy Kids - Healthy You as early as possible for this school year.  You can help us accomplish our ambitious
goals by being part of our crowd-funding campaign on Indiegogo.


Just $10 supports a family of four.


Just $250 supports an entire classroom. We’ll
have that classroom listed as “Class of the Day.”


Just $2,500 supports an entire school and gets
that school listed as “School of the Week.”

Our web site: www.healthykidshealthyyou.com
Help us introduce this game-changing platform beginning with the 2014-15 school year.
Please alert your neighbors, work colleagues, friends, and family about the Healthy
Kids–Healthy You program. It is only possible through your generosity.FLING ZING to 5 of your Friends: www.healthykidshealthyyou.com/zing/Our targets:1.  Target Goal: $500,000
90 days post funding Healthy Kids - Healthy You will be launched with Web, Tablet, and Mobile applications.
Supports at least 50,000 Families on Healthy Kids - Healthy You via School and WIC outreach.
2.  Goal for Latino Program: $1,000,000
90 days post Healthy Kids - Healthy You launch, we will have a Spanish version for Latinos with Web, Tablet, and Mobile applications
Supports 100,000 Families on Healthy Kids - Healthy You via School and WIC outreach.
3.  Stretch Goal
Help us to reach more schools and families. The more you give the more we can reach. We are ready to scale our program nationally, even globally.

 firmly believe that when a person gets to know something, sees its 
value, and comes to appreciate it, they will care for it. Getting people
 into the wilderness who would not otherwise have the confidence or 
skills to explore freely is key to saving wilderness areas. After all, 
if ""wilderness"" is just a concept that they see in movies or read about,
 it doesn't seem real. This is why I believe that running a guiding 
service is the best thing that I can do to help protect our fragile 
planet, while doing two of the things I love: being with people and 
being in the wilderness. <br/></p><div> My name is Jeff Lush and I live in 
beautiful British Columbia. For many years I have been going on long 
treks into the wilderness and since my teens people have suggested that I
 start a business taking people with me. I will be officially launching 
Northwest Trailguides in June 2015, and begin taking people on guided 
day hikes. One of the prerequisites that I need to fulfill to start this
 service is to renew my certification in advanced wilderness first aid. 
This course by Slipstream First Aid is designed to help wilderness 
guides care for sick or injured clients until the client can be 
evacuated. In the past i have taken the course and obtained certification twice 
primarily for self-care during my many long trips into the wild, but it is expired now. 
Achieving recertification in AWFA  is a necessity for obtaining business
 insurance and re assuring clients that I can take care of them. In the 
world of first aid, the approved practices and procedures are constantly
 evolving so that people like me can provide the best and most up to 
date care available.<p></p>
<p> The course is roughly $700. The 
remaining $500 that I am raising is to help pay my bills during the 10 
days that I will miss work to take the course. If I am unable to raise 
the full amount needed during this indiegogo campaign, I will run it 
again to raise the rest of the funds. Any money raised in excess of of 
the goal will be used to add extras like a stethoscope and pulse 
oximeter to my first aid kit. Slipstream's 2015 calendar is not yet 
posted, but I plan to take the course in April or May 2015.</p>
<p> In
 2001/2002, I worked as a senior field guide for a program that takes 
at-risk youth on multi week expeditions into the Sonoran desert. With 
the skills I developed there, plus the five one-week long survival 
classes that I took at the famous Tracker School, and the many long 
trips I have taken on my own, I am more than qualified to lead people in
 the outdoors. </p>

Monetarily, Jamaica  is a basket case, along with Greece, Spain, Ireland and other countries.

<li>Idiegogo fees which may be as much as 12% of amount raised. </li>

<p>The estimate may seem low to accomplish so much but i will be doing much of the work myself, having <a href=""http://www.wisdomforthesoul.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wisdom for the Soul"">already self-published</a> successfully. Whether or not the target is reached, the project will continue as i am fully committed to it. There is nothing more critically urgent and important for me to do at this time.   </p>
<p>I'll be first to recognize the irony of soliciting money for a project that sets out to supplant it, but it is the system in which we are embedded. It leaves me no choice. With NPV, crowd-funding will be unnecessary, but websites such as this will still perform the function (which is how they increase their NPV) of bringing projects and ideas to public attention. How you vote on a given scale would influence the assigned NPV of the enterprise.</p>
<p>Other aspects presaging and fully supported by NPV, and already familiar to most, are Open Source, Creative Commons, cradle-to-cradle manufacturing, and access to goods and services without owning, like Netflix, ZipCar, bicycle share, tool-lending libraries, etc.</p>
<p>Case in point: Contributors outside of the US, please add 10% to defray shipping costs. The US Postal Service needs our support. Under NPV, the USPS will be self-sustaining, having access to resources concomitant with its level of value creation. No need to go a-begging a recalcitrant Congress.  </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If this takes off, this will be a game-changer, in the league of Copernicus' heliocentrism and Einstein's relativity. Our whole concept of value will be freed of the corrupting and corroding taint of money. Everything associated with barter, exchange, profit, exploitation, interest, investment, insurance, and banking will fade away. Not to mention bribery and embezzlement. Profit-making will be replaced by value creation. The environment will be saved. Poverty and deprivation will be no more.</p>
<p>You can choose to be a pioneer, help make history, by supporting this pivotal campaign. Everyone will be impacted down the line.   </p>
<p>The task now is to spread this idea as widely as possible, but more importantly, to seize the imagination of those who can see it through to implementation.

<h3>Some reviews</h3>
<p class=""paragraph_style"">THE NPV economic theory is brilliant, exciting, and elegant in its functional simplicity. The NPV system integrates the foundation economy, the ecosystem, with the more recent, emergent evolutionary holon: the complexity of the human economic system. NPV is structured such that it automatically synchs the measurement and health of ecosystems, both micro and macro, with human economies -- IN REAL TIME! </p>
<p class=""paragraph_style"">NPV is not a blank slate concept. It allows for human nature as it is, and appropriately, to my mind, allows the market to work, reflecting the innate, bio/cultural differentiation of human abilities, drive and execution of goals. Healthy ecosystems and our ability to create almost infinite things from these finite resources, are intrinsically balanced with NPV.</p>
<p class=""paragraph_style"">As I understand it, NPV is a huge step forward in cultural evolution. </p>
<p class=""paragraph_style"">NPV is a postgenetic code that encompasses a huge swath of human information processing. It’s the most hopeful concept I’ve read to deal with the multiple dilemmas resulting from our exponential growth in both population and technological power. Frankly, I love it!</p>

<p class=""paragraph_style"">Excellent and just the kind of out of the box thinking that will pull the species and biosphere from the brink of extinction ... The ideas you are putting forth are highly cogent and exactly the kind of retooling humanity needs if we are going to escape with our heads intact ... As for what you have outlined for NPV I do see it as a very strong framework for evolving our monetary system beyond its current myopic dimensions and toward a much saner and holistic ""resource accounting system"" which properly folds in the wider social &amp; ecological costs which we can no longer afford to ignore without catastrophic consequences.</p>

<p>If you haven’t already come to the conclusion that financial fictions such as money, taxes, fees, interest, debt and insurance are the root of all evil, then read on and become part of a growing universal community eager to embrace Net Planetary Value and forego the toxic effects of money and the wage slavery and suppression it causes.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the Net Planetary Value system envisioned is the environmental, social and ethical values based system that will lead us to a more equitable distribution and positive use of our planetary assets – natural and human resources, and time.</p>
<p>If implementing Larry Chang’s Net Planetary Value proposition means more of us will follow our bliss, pursue learning, become more engaged in governance, healthy community building and sustainability and we will eliminate a market economy founded on wealth, then take my money now and apply it toward creating planetary value!</p>

As for what you have outlined for NPV I do see it as a very strong framework for evolving our monetary system beyond its current myopic dimensions and toward a much saner and holistic ""resource accounting system"" which properly folds in the wider social & ecological costs which we can no longer afford to ignore without catastrophic consequences.
- Brian Thompson, blogger at Imagine Emergence
-------------------------------
Your idea rocks...!!! I have read the whole PANACEA site ... i'm very excited and moved to learn about this perspective, hell of a notion, really ... how to organize human culture in an optimal way, and the NPV index is just such a natural idea.
- Jyre Heffron, musician

If you haven’t already come to the conclusion that financial fictions such as money, taxes, fees, interest, debt and insurance are the root of all evil, then read on and become part of a growing universal community eager to embrace Net Planetary Value and forego the toxic effects of money and the wage slavery and suppression it causes.
I am convinced that the Net Planetary Value system envisioned is the environmental, social and ethical values based system that will lead us to a more equitable distribution and positive use of our planetary assets – natural and human resources, and time.
If implementing Larry Chang’s Net Planetary Value proposition means more of us will follow our bliss, pursue learning, become more engaged in governance, healthy community building and sustainability and we will eliminate a market economy founded on wealth, then take my money now and apply it toward creating planetary value!

You have bolstered my spirits in my effort to ""Wake People Up"". Although there are times I think my life would be so much simpler if I just took the Blue Pill.
- Liberalthinker1
-------------------------------
I'd really like to see these ideas in action ... Well, it is amazing. Keep at it. I wish you the best of luck.
- Zeitgeist
-------------------------------
It is very accurate and true, and even the idea for the new system sounds decent and reasonable. There are a lot more details and factors to consider and work out, but it's not bad.

<h3>Rick Powell Needs Our Help - Please Read</h3>
<p>My name is Erik Armstrong. I am starting this campaign for my very good friend, Rick Powell, who was working Monday April 1, 2013 in Seattle as a driver for a car service when on break late that night, was suddenly approached by a 19-year old who attempted to rob him and then shot him three times without provocation, hitting him with all shots in the upper chest area.</p>
<p>Rick fought back bravely and the suspect escaped, but was captured a short time later and will soon face justice. The battle had just begun for my friend.</p>
<p>Because of the wounds he sustained, Rick nearly died in the street that night, and was it not for the quick response of the paramedics and the work of the emergency room surgeons at Harborview Medical Center; he would not be with us today.</p>
<p>Rick is that person that you are so glad your life has crossed paths with. There isn't anyone in the world who can say anything but great things about this man, and of course, Rick always has great things to say about everyone as well.</p>
<p>Along with being just a wonderful human being, Rick Powell is a very talented musician and very active in the local Seattle music scene. In years past, I personally had the opportunity to be in two different bands with him and it was definitely some of the best times in my life. He always has something funny or interesting to say and the kind of outlook on life that motivates other people to want to do better.</p>
<p>Right now, Rick is recovering from this horrendous act of random violence and needs our help. He has needed a great deal of life saving care thus far and will need much more help during his long recovery process. The bills for this care, needless to say, are going to be very high.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>To Summarize</h3>
<p>Rick is without medical insurance, and like a lot of people, especially younger people trying to make ends meet, this is an unfortunate reality. My goal is to raise $25,000 through this campaign so that every penny can go towards paying whatever hospital bills or procure whatever services Rick needs during his recovery.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to this campaign to help my dear friend, Rick Powell, will mean that you are helping a truly decent and good human being in his darkest time. In spite of all that has happened, he is in good spirits at the hospital and I know that he will make a full recovery because of the kind of character that he is made of and his positive outlook on life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Erik Armstrong</p>

<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p>My name is Kayla, I am a mother of two living in Lansing Mi. I have a 5 year old and a 1 year old. My mother has been the main support in my life. through bad choices and wrong decisions my mother has stood by my side. She has put me through school and supported me with babysitting, food, clothing, money for bills and transpiration. She is an amazing grandmother and a wonderful mother.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2009 Blue care network closed after my mother worked as a pediatric medical assistant for 17 years. She struggled to run a purse kiosk in the meridian mall for three years. In december of 2011 she closed her stand. I thought it was because she wasn't making enough income and then in January 2012 she announced to me she had found a lump in her breast and that is why she closed her business. She said that she did not tell me any sooner because she did not want to ruin christmas. In february 2012 she was diagnosed with breast cancer. My mother has been so brave through out this whole year. She has good days and bad like everyone. Without insurance she was given state medicaid and food stamps. As a daughter i feel helpless my feiance works full time minimum wage making $800.00 a month and we are doing all we can to support our daughters and my mommy! The bills are unpaid and the stress and worry is taking its toll on our family.</p>
<p>I started this campaign to raise money to help lift the burden of the bills. My ultimate goal is to take my mom on a short peaceful vacation with the girls so that she can have one great memory before she is to sick to enjoy her time with us. And for once let her enjoy her time without worry overwhelming her mind.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kerri, and I am a behavioral consultant working with kids with autism.  Recently, my sister-in-law was re-diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer (at 31 and now again at 41).  Instead of sitting around and doing nothing, we have created a logo (FUBC) and are attempting to start a foundation which will allow us to donate money to research for stage 4 breast cancer (a particularly under-funded disease). We are hoping to increase awareness, raise money, save lives, and give a giant FU to breast cancer.</p>
<p>Currently, we need funds to create a foundation (expensive paperwork!) and to make t-shirts with our logo.  The t-shirts and hopefully other merchandise, will help raise money  for research.  Since my sister-in-law is working with wonderful doctors in the New York area, we will be donating to their research.   </p>
<p>Anyone who donates over 40.00 dollars will get an FUBC t-shirt!</p>
<p>My sister-in-law is a fighter...but can't do this alone.  I'm going to do all I can to help research and find a cure for this horrible disease that will effect 1 in 8 women.  They will be your mothers, daughters, aunts, and best friends.  Please help us set up our foundation.</p>

Na Wahine Softball program.  All funds raised by this fundraiser will be
donated to the Na Wahine Softball program through the UH Foundation.</p>
<p>With these funds the Softball Booster club will purchase a
complete heat press system for the express purpose of pressing custom softball
designed tee shirts at each game.  They
will have two new designs for each series, they will also be able to
personalize each shirt with your name on the front for an additional charge.</p>
<p>All funds raised by selling of tee shirts will be used
exclusively to support the University of Hawai'i Rainbow Wahine Softball
program via post-game meals, financing the professional development of the
coaching staff, assisting with the purchasing of additional softball
equipment/training aids, and as needed to help offset educational-related
expenses.</p>
<p>At the end of this campaign all funds will be deposited into my
account which in turn will donated online to the UH Foundation softball booster
account.</p>

This is a personal endeavor to raise funds to be donated to the
Na Wahine Softball program.  All funds raised by this fundraiser will be
donated to the Na Wahine Softball program through the UH Foundation.
With these funds the Softball Booster club will purchase a
complete heat press system for the express purpose of pressing custom softball
designed tee shirts at each game.  They
will have two new designs for each series, they will also be able to
personalize each shirt with your name on the front for an additional charge.
All funds raised by selling of tee shirts will be used
exclusively to support the University of Hawai'i Rainbow Wahine Softball
program via post-game meals, financing the professional development of the
coaching staff, assisting with the purchasing of additional softball
equipment/training aids, and as needed to help offset educational-related
expenses.
At the end of this campaign all funds will be deposited into my
account which in turn will donated online to the UH Foundation softball booster
account.

</p><p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>The Living Well Institute is the home for Whole Person Health advocacy, research and education that benefits the entire community – individuals, families, and the healthcare profession alike.  The research project that needs your help will provide a platform for validating the Whole Person Health methodology – providing critical proof-of-concept that the mind-body-spirit approach changes lives and dramatically increases the efficacy of existing health care approaches. </p>
<p>Phase 1 </p>
<p>Research provided the foundation of qualitative research (n = 25) to clearly define the methodology and provide themes of experiences of people who had been part of Living Well.  The four themes identified that each person had a transformational experience by participating in Living Well, the community and the integrator were critical to that transformation, and the person took person responsibility for their health – in mind, body and spirit – to achieve balance and well-being.  As a social scientist and professor at Penn State Hershey College of Medicine, I have developed the research plan and continue to support the concept of whole-person health.  </p>
<p>Phase 2 </p>
<p>Research will involve pilot testing the methodology in a population of people with type 2 diabetes during a 12-month study.  This pilot test will open the doors for greater funding through the National Institutes of Health (NIDDK), the American Diabetes Association, or smaller foundations that support the work.  Without the research, Living Well would not have the foundation to build the concept, nor would we know the efficacy and potential improvements that could be made to the program without testing.  Feedback from real-world clinical experience is crucial for comparing and improving behavioral interventions.  After the research, the methodology of Living Well may be used by millions of people in many different contexts, not just medical-related.  Therefore, research is critical to record and assess the experiences in clinical practice to develop guidelines for best practices for integrating mind-body-spirit into life. <br/><br/>
Education is critical to Living Well, as it brings the three dimensional perspective of mind-body-spirit to help people become aware of the 7 steps in the lifestyle program.  They include:  (1) take responsibility for your health; (2) renew your mind; (3) attend to your body; (4) cultivate your spirit; (5) maximize your resources; (6) make a plan; and (7) practice the integration daily.  Through the lifestyle program that teaches this principles, participants learn to apply these steps into their life.  As the qualitative research has shown, the education around these principles and the daily attention to mind, body and spirit produces sustaining results.  People who are in pain, or experience illness, or heartache, are generally open to learning something new to improve their situation.  We used a people-centered approach in education, where our educators merely act as facilitators and integrators to allow individuals to create their own plan for health.  </p>
<p>The combination of research and education are the two pillars of Living Well, and the offer the support to sustain funding and ongoing research for the Institute.  It will assure quality, integrity and the best possible product to improve whole-person health and serve the most people in a better way.</p>

The initial fee of $33k for tooling and sourcing of materials have been paid. But due to New Year Celebration (Chinese NY), they will start until Feb 22nd. According to the agreement, the tooling stage will take 12 weeks. Then we are looking at about 3-4 months to actually produce the first batch of 1000 units. We'are sorry, but these are the realities of bringing such a complicated product to market. <br/><br/>But fear not, you will not loose your contribution. We have processed quite a few refunds already and have enough money to refund the rest. Please send your Paypal email to us (cs @ smartbackbrace.com) and we will process your refund promptly. <br/><br/>Thank you<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Update - Dec 15th 2015:<br/><br/>Dear Contributors,<br/>I am happy to report that the design and development stage of SBB is complete! At the end we've end up making 4 different prototypes with several units each of the main body and over a dozen (!) different designs for straps. At this time we are sourcing all the components in China and working with IDP's manufacturer there to come up with a manufacturing quote. Since the SBB is fairly complex peace of engineering with few specialized components - it may take some time. We hope it will be about 1 month. Therefore, by the end of January we should have accurate manufacturing quote and actually start making the units. <br/><br/>Please check out <a href=""http://www.smartbackbrace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our website</a> for the updated photos and videos of the new design. Our offer of refund (see previous update bellow) still stands. <br/><br/>Thank you<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Update - Nov 13th 2015:<br/><br/>Dear Contributors,<br/>I'm sorry for the delay in development of SBB. We have ran into few issues with electronics and design of the straps. But I'm happy to report that all those issues are now resolved! Right now, we are waiting for the last set of straps to be made by our sewer (that would take approximately 2 weeks). After that we will send our prototype and those new straps to our manufacturer in China. Then it would take another month to get a quote from them and start making the SBB. After some time for packaging, shipping and customs we will have the units at our warehouse in California. At this time (approximately in Feb 2016) we will fulfill the orders at the maximum speed. <br/><br/>Please check out the new SBB website for pictures of the new unit:<br/><a href=""http://www.smartbackbrace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New Smart Back Brace Website</a><br/><br/>We understand that we have failed to fulfill by the promised deadline. That is why we are offering no-questions-asked refund to anybody who wishes. If you wish to receive a full refund, please send your details and Paypal email address to cs@smartbackbrace.com. Thank you!<br/><br/>What happened in the last few months:<br/>1. We've designed and redesign the SBB body few times (please see the website for pictures) - it now looks way awesome! <br/>2. We've ran into the issue with strain gauges being too expensive (the part that measures the tension on the straps), but were able to find a reasonably alternative.<br/>3. We've went through a dozen of designs for the straps. Seriously, my house looks like a fabrics store now. Many designs were created and all, but one, failed to live up to our expectations. <br/>4. The IDP team wrote several different version of iPhone and Android apps. We've found and fix many different bugs and made interface much simpler. The apps are ready for prime-time now. <br/><br/>In terms of money, we are about the projected budget. Initially estimated at $100k of the development budget - we are now only about $7k over that. The additional expenses will include the purchase of the first 1000 units (estimated at $50k). But, as I said before - I've got this covered! Even though, this campaign brought only about $30k, I have promised to cover the rest - so I am. I shall see this project through, no matter what it takes. Besides, it is almost done! <br/><br/>Thank you<br/>Andy<br/><br/><br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>The <a href=""http://www.smartbackbrace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Smart Back Brace</a> (SBB) is the posture-correcting device.
In physical usage it is similar to many other clavicle braces available on the
market. However, what sets it apart is the “smart” part that actually trains
your upper body muscles while you are wearing it. At the heart of SBB is the
tiny electronic unit that continuously monitors the tension on the straps.
Using patented technology, it is able to accurately determine when the wearer is
hunching. When this happens it notifies him or her by vibrating. The goal of using
the SBB is to train the wearer to keep his or her shoulders back without any
assistance. <br/><p><br/></p><p><b>From the inventor:</b><br/>
Hello, I am Andy and I have been struggling with my posture for years. I have
tried many different devices but none of them did what I wanted. I found
clavicle straps, the ones that pull your shoulders back, work the best. But the
problem is they only work for the first 3-5 minutes and after that your body
gets used to the device and becomes depended on  it. I thought that’s not right!
There must be a better way to train your muscles to stay back by themselves. If
only I could somehow detect the wearer is slacking off, and remind him or her
to pull shoulders back. While wearing one of those clavicle braces, I have
noticed as I relax my shoulders, the tension on the straps increases. In fact,
it increases so much that it hurts my underarms! Bingo! It hit me. Why not put
a small tension sensor on the strap? When it detects that the average tension
has increased, it will know that the user has relaxed and will notify him or her to
straighten up. This is how the original idea of SBB was born. <br/></p><p>
</p><p><b>Development Update (December
23<sup>rd</sup> 2014):</b><br/>
We have contracted the <a href=""http://innovativedesignproducts.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Innovative Design Products</a> (IDP) company in Irvine, CA. The
IDP is the prototyping company with over 20 years’ experience developing consumer
electronics products for various industries. With hundreds of successful
products designed and delivered, there is no doubt that IDP has what it takes
to make SBB the reality in a shortest possible time. The IDP has already
completed the detailed Development Plan for SBB. This plan consists of 4
stages, starting with Stage 1: “Technical Feasibility, Design and Engineering”
(estimated at $29,000, 8 weeks); Stage 2: “Alpha Prototyping” (estimated as $26,000, 8 weeks); Stage 3: “Refinement
&amp; Beta Prototyping” (estimated at $26,000, 8 weeks); Stage 4: “Comprehensive
Manufacturing Package” (Estimated at $5,000, 3 weeks) - for the total of
$86,000, not including additional expenses of acquiring various government compliance
licenses, shipping and possible customs tariffs. The IDP has several
professionals who will be working on SBB project: John Gibson (Electronics
Engineer, 25 years of experience), Rob Gorman (App Developer, 20 years of experience,
plus master’s degree in computer science), Bob Gibb (Mechanical Engineer, 25
years of experience, specializing in consumer products), Joseph Emerson
(Industrial Design, product research and conceptualization), Hamid Ali (Custom
Prototype Fabrication, 20 years of experience), Alex Chen (Manufacturing, 15 years of experience) and, most importantly,
Mitch Kobara (Project Manager and IDP boss, with 25 years of experience of
prototyping and manufacturing consumer products). Additionally, we expect to
cut down some of the development time for Stage 1 and State 2, since we have
already done some of the design and testing. </p>
<p><br/><b>Give me simple explanation of what is SBB:</b><br/>Basically, SBB is this product: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Clavicle-Support-Fractures-Shoulder-Support-/dp/B00CMV3BEM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416949111&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=clavicle+support"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon.com - Deluxe Clavicle Support</a> 
(please check out many positive reviews). Except, on the back, 
where straps join, the SBB will have a small electronic unit which is 
about the same size as the ring on the product above. The SBB will have 
durable adjustable straps that pull your shoulders 
back. The idea is to keep something that works as is, but add an extra 
""smart"" part. <br/><br/><b>How exactly is it going to work?</b><br/>Step 1: You put on the SBB<br/>Step

 2: You adjust the straps for correct tension. This is a little tricky 
because you need to select tension that is comfortable for you. In 
general, you would want to select tension that will keep your shoulders 
back but would not be tight enough to trigger warnings all the time. 
Think about it like this: when you are wearing SBB and you have your 
shoulders back - the tension should be barely noticeable. Therefore, as
 you start to forget about keeping your shoulders back, they will sag; 
consequently the tension on the straps will increase. At that time, 
SBB will detect this and will issue warning, either by vibrating or by 
sending alert to your phone. By the end of your training you will 
subconsciously know at which position your shoulders should be NOT to 
trigger a warning; thereby, the SBB has effectively trained your 
muscles. <br/><br/>Of course, the settings on SBB are fully customizable 
(see app screenshots bellow). Your will be able to control at which 
level SBB will issue warnings. Additionally, you can specify how 
often SBB will measure the tension and what kind of average it will use 
to calculate if you exceed this average. The reason why we use the average is
 so that SBB will NOT issue a warning when there is a sharp spike in 
tension. This could happen if you reach for something, for example. <br/><br/><b>How does SBB stack up against competition?</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1049567/files/20141126135019-sbb_vs_competitors.png?1417038619"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>How much do we need to get it off the ground?</b><br/>
</p><p>We estimate $100,000. More than 90% of that that money will go directly to
IDP as per our contact with them to develop and bring SBB to market. The
remaining will be spent on shipping, acquisition of various government permits
and advertising. But, in the great scheme of things,
that is truly peanuts! Search ""posturenow + sharktank"" - they've
raised $100k for 30% of the company with inferior product and, despite that,
are still profitable! Let's show those ""sharks"" that crowd-funding is
a better way to go! This is a short fundraising campaign (40 days). So, you
better make up your mind fast! </p>
<p><b>I love SBB but I don’t need it. How can I help?</b><br/>The best thing you can do is to let your friends and family
members know about it. The SBB will make a world of difference for somebody
with posture problem. If you have connections with bloggers, tech reviewers or
news agencies please urge them to take a look at our project and write
something. Contact: cs @ SmartBackBrace.com <br/><br/></p><br/><h2>
Risks and challenges <br/>
</h2>
<p>Design &amp; Manufacturing:</p>
<p>Even though there are many parts to the electronic hub of SBB, there 
is nothing special that doesn't already exist. All those parts are 
available from multiple manufacturers - no special parts need to be 
""invented"" for this device to be produced. Therefore, the real challenge
 is not to ""invent something new"" but rather use existing parts and put 
them together in high-quality reliable package. </p>
<p>Manufacturing of a product such as Smart Back Brace is a daunting 
task. That is why we let professionals do it. While our team has 
extensive knowledge of electronics engineering, manufacturing 
electronics is a different ball game. We are currently contacting 
several manufacturers to review our designs and fabricate SBB on a large
 scale – 10,000+ units. Additionally, we are contacting a third party 
engineering firm to help us with design of Bluetooth, as well as

<p><b>FAQ’s</b><br/><br/>
<b>Why you are not on Kickstarter?</b><br/>
Because they refused to list my campaign on the grounds that they do not accept
any devices that claim to “cure any disease or illness”. Though, bad posture is
hardly an illness, I decided NOT to deal with those dicks. Let’s show them that
IndieGoGo is better!<br/>
<br/>
<b>How the development is going?</b><br/>
Despite it being a holiday season (BTW, Happy Holidays, Everybody!), we have
been continuously working on SBB. In the video you can see version number 4.
But as of right now, we already are on version number 6. With input of
mechanical engineer from IDP, we have designed 2 more bodies. The objective was
to make it more ergonomic – easier to wear. As the result, they look radically
different from version #4. Specifically, they are rounder and without any
corners or sharp edges. Here are a couple of AutoCAD screenshots: <br/></p>
<span><b>Apart from case design, how the development of
other parts is progressing?</b><br/>
Together with IDP electronics engineers, we are working on finding the right
strain gauges to measure the tension. There are thousands of those gauges on the
market! We are trying to identify the one that would work for SBB. After we
identify some, we will test them in the setting similar to SBB. Additionally,
the IDP engineers are trying to identify all other components that would go
inside. For example, just today we’ve had a big discussion on whether or not to
include auto-shut off mechanism that would detect movement or lack thereof and automatically
turn SBB on or off to preserve battery. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Does it really work? Does it correct posture? Any proof?</b><br/>
Yes, it does. Not only that - it does it better than anything on the market
today. How can I be so sure? Consider this: the SBB is the clavicle support
system (the type of posture-correcting device that pulls your shoulders back) –
there are thousands of those on the market. Search of Amazon and you will see great
number of them. Some are not so good, some are alright (checkout real-world
reviews). Without even talking about the SBB’s “smart” part – it will already
do the function of being a clavicle support – which has proven to be effective.
Now, if we add a “smart” part to already effective device, it becomes ultra-effective!
Not only it will physically help you correct posture, but also will teach your
how to stay proper. Granted, that it may annoy you with warnings about your bad
posture. But it will only do that when you are, indeed, slouching. Of course,
all of the above will only work IF you are actually wearing it! The SBB will
come with usage tracking to help you motivate yourself and show others that you
are trying. Perhaps, you can think of some kind of reward for yourself when you
don’t trigger warnings while wearing it. Motivation is HUGE factor when it
comes to posture correcting.<br/>
</span><br/><b>Is shipping included?</b><br/>Yes. <br/></div>","Update - Feb 4th 2016:Dear Contributors,We were able to find a factory in China to produce SBB and have signed a manufacturing agreement. The initial fee of $33k for tooling and sourcing of materials have been paid. But due to New Year Celebration (Chinese NY), they will start until Feb 22nd. According to the agreement, the tooling stage will take 12 weeks. Then we are looking at about 3-4 months to actually produce the first batch of 1000 units. We'are sorry, but these are the realities of bringing such a complicated product to market. But fear not, you will not loose your contribution. We have processed quite a few refunds already and have enough money to refund the rest. Please send your Paypal email to us (cs @ smartbackbrace.com) and we will process your refund promptly. Thank you>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Update - Dec 15th 2015:Dear Contributors,I am happy to report that the design and development stage of SBB is complete! At the end we've end up making 4 different prototypes with several units each of the main body and over a dozen (!) different designs for straps. At this time we are sourcing all the components in China and working with IDP's manufacturer there to come up with a manufacturing quote. Since the SBB is fairly complex peace of engineering with few specialized components - it may take some time. We hope it will be about 1 month. Therefore, by the end of January we should have accurate manufacturing quote and actually start making the units. Please check out our website for the updated photos and videos of the new design. Our offer of refund (see previous update bellow) still stands. Thank you>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Update - Nov 13th 2015:Dear Contributors,I'm sorry for the delay in development of SBB. We have ran into few issues with electronics and design of the straps. But I'm happy to report that all those issues are now resolved! Right now, we are waiting for the last set of straps to be made by our sewer (that would take approximately 2 weeks). After that we will send our prototype and those new straps to our manufacturer in China. Then it would take another month to get a quote from them and start making the SBB. After some time for packaging, shipping and customs we will have the units at our warehouse in California. At this time (approximately in Feb 2016) we will fulfill the orders at the maximum speed. Please check out the new SBB website for pictures of the new unit:New Smart Back Brace WebsiteWe understand that we have failed to fulfill by the promised deadline. That is why we are offering no-questions-asked refund to anybody who wishes. If you wish to receive a full refund, please send your details and Paypal email address to cs@smartbackbrace.com. Thank you!What happened in the last few months:1. We've designed and redesign the SBB body few times (please see the website for pictures) - it now looks way awesome! 2. We've ran into the issue with strain gauges being too expensive (the part that measures the tension on the straps), but were able to find a reasonably alternative.3. We've went through a dozen of designs for the straps. Seriously, my house looks like a fabrics store now. Many designs were created and all, but one, failed to live up to our expectations. 4. The IDP team wrote several different version of iPhone and Android apps. We've found and fix many different bugs and made interface much simpler. The apps are ready for prime-time now. In terms of money, we are about the projected budget. Initially estimated at $100k of the development budget - we are now only about $7k over that. The additional expenses will include the purchase of the first 1000 units (estimated at $50k). But, as I said before - I've got this covered! Even though, this campaign brought only about $30k, I have promised to cover the rest - so I am. I shall see this project through, no matter what it takes. Besides, it is almost done! Thank youAndy>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>The Smart Back Brace (SBB) is the posture-correcting device.
In physical usage it is similar to many other clavicle braces available on the
market. However, what sets it apart is the “smart” part that actually trains
your upper body muscles while you are wearing it. At the heart of SBB is the
tiny electronic unit that continuously monitors the tension on the straps.
Using patented technology, it is able to accurately determine when the wearer is
hunching. When this happens it notifies him or her by vibrating. The goal of using
the SBB is to train the wearer to keep his or her shoulders back without any
assistance. From the inventor:
Hello, I am Andy and I have been struggling with my posture for years. I have
tried many different devices but none of them did what I wanted. I found
clavicle straps, the ones that pull your shoulders back, work the best. But the
problem is they only work for the first 3-5 minutes and after that your body
gets used to the device and becomes depended on  it. I thought that’s not right!
There must be a better way to train your muscles to stay back by themselves. If
only I could somehow detect the wearer is slacking off, and remind him or her
to pull shoulders back. While wearing one of those clavicle braces, I have
noticed as I relax my shoulders, the tension on the straps increases. In fact,
it increases so much that it hurts my underarms! Bingo! It hit me. Why not put
a small tension sensor on the strap? When it detects that the average tension
has increased, it will know that the user has relaxed and will notify him or her to
straighten up. This is how the original idea of SBB was born. 
Development Update (December
23rd 2014):
We have contracted the Innovative Design Products (IDP) company in Irvine, CA. The
IDP is the prototyping company with over 20 years’ experience developing consumer
electronics products for various industries. With hundreds of successful
products designed and delivered, there is no doubt that IDP has what it takes
to make SBB the reality in a shortest possible time. The IDP has already
completed the detailed Development Plan for SBB. This plan consists of 4
stages, starting with Stage 1: “Technical Feasibility, Design and Engineering”
(estimated at $29,000, 8 weeks); Stage 2: “Alpha Prototyping” (estimated as $26,000, 8 weeks); Stage 3: “Refinement
& Beta Prototyping” (estimated at $26,000, 8 weeks); Stage 4: “Comprehensive
Manufacturing Package” (Estimated at $5,000, 3 weeks) - for the total of
$86,000, not including additional expenses of acquiring various government compliance
licenses, shipping and possible customs tariffs. The IDP has several
professionals who will be working on SBB project: John Gibson (Electronics
Engineer, 25 years of experience), Rob Gorman (App Developer, 20 years of experience,
plus master’s degree in computer science), Bob Gibb (Mechanical Engineer, 25
years of experience, specializing in consumer products), Joseph Emerson
(Industrial Design, product research and conceptualization), Hamid Ali (Custom
Prototype Fabrication, 20 years of experience), Alex Chen (Manufacturing, 15 years of experience) and, most importantly,
Mitch Kobara (Project Manager and IDP boss, with 25 years of experience of
prototyping and manufacturing consumer products). Additionally, we expect to
cut down some of the development time for Stage 1 and State 2, since we have
already done some of the design and testing. 
Give me simple explanation of what is SBB:Basically, SBB is this product: Amazon.com - Deluxe Clavicle Support 
(please check out many positive reviews). Except, on the back, 
where straps join, the SBB will have a small electronic unit which is 
about the same size as the ring on the product above. The SBB will have 
durable adjustable straps that pull your shoulders 
back. The idea is to keep something that works as is, but add an extra 
""smart"" part. How exactly is it going to work?Step 1: You put on the SBBStep

 2: You adjust the straps for correct tension. This is a little tricky 
because you need to select tension that is comfortable for you. In 
general, you would want to select tension that will keep your shoulders 
back but would not be tight enough to trigger warnings all the time. 
Think about it like this: when you are wearing SBB and you have your 
shoulders back - the tension should be barely noticeable. Therefore, as
 you start to forget about keeping your shoulders back, they will sag; 
consequently the tension on the straps will increase. At that time, 
SBB will detect this and will issue warning, either by vibrating or by 
sending alert to your phone. By the end of your training you will 
subconsciously know at which position your shoulders should be NOT to 
trigger a warning; thereby, the SBB has effectively trained your 
muscles. Of course, the settings on SBB are fully customizable 
(see app screenshots bellow). Your will be able to control at which 
level SBB will issue warnings. Additionally, you can specify how 
often SBB will measure the tension and what kind of average it will use 
to calculate if you exceed this average. The reason why we use the average is
 so that SBB will NOT issue a warning when there is a sharp spike in 
tension. This could happen if you reach for something, for example. How does SBB stack up against competition?How much do we need to get it off the ground?
We estimate $100,000. More than 90% of that that money will go directly to
IDP as per our contact with them to develop and bring SBB to market. The
remaining will be spent on shipping, acquisition of various government permits
and advertising. But, in the great scheme of things,
that is truly peanuts! Search ""posturenow + sharktank"" - they've
raised $100k for 30% of the company with inferior product and, despite that,
are still profitable! Let's show those ""sharks"" that crowd-funding is
a better way to go! This is a short fundraising campaign (40 days). So, you
better make up your mind fast! 
I love SBB but I don’t need it. How can I help?The best thing you can do is to let your friends and family
members know about it. The SBB will make a world of difference for somebody
with posture problem. If you have connections with bloggers, tech reviewers or
news agencies please urge them to take a look at our project and write
something. Contact: cs @ SmartBackBrace.com 
Risks and challenges 

Design & Manufacturing:
Even though there are many parts to the electronic hub of SBB, there 
is nothing special that doesn't already exist. All those parts are 
available from multiple manufacturers - no special parts need to be 
""invented"" for this device to be produced. Therefore, the real challenge
 is not to ""invent something new"" but rather use existing parts and put 
them together in high-quality reliable package. 
Manufacturing of a product such as Smart Back Brace is a daunting 
task. That is why we let professionals do it. While our team has 
extensive knowledge of electronics engineering, manufacturing 
electronics is a different ball game. We are currently contacting 
several manufacturers to review our designs and fabricate SBB on a large
 scale – 10,000+ units. Additionally, we are contacting a third party 
engineering firm to help us with design of Bluetooth, as well as 
procedures to pass FCC regulations which are required for all 
electronics sold in the U.S.A. 
Once the design is approved, prototypes are fully tested and 
manufacturing agreement signed, we do not expect any delays or problems.
 However, production will require a 60 days lead time to create molds 
and lining up all of electronic components. 
Fulfillment:
Depending on which manufacturer we use, the shipment of orders will 
vary. But we will make sure that we have good suppliers with robust 
shipping facilities. Again, delays are always possible, but we will do 
our best to ensure we don’t have them.

<p>CIREN was invented to combine handsome design and wearable technology with the social networked and mobile applications.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first prototype has proven that CIREN can realize the vision of a smart alarm device with huge range of functionality. The money will be used for developing CIREN to serial production, to finalize the software and iOS and Android app and to step into the market. <i>We will settle the company in USA and Germany in parallel. Our team in CA is focusing on SW development the team in Germany on hardware and design.

<p>“I have invented the CIREN smart private
alarm based on experiences in real life. I am a black belt full contact Karate
Trainer and I am teaching women and children in self-defence. During me courses
we are discussing records and experience of the daily live and I recognized: in
more than 50% of the situation a smart alarm system could have been a perfect
prevention or help.”</p>
<p>The CIREN (the name comes from “Cyber” and
“Siren”) was invented as a very smart, easy to use system which can be used for
a couple of other very nice functions. But during in our development with some
UK partners, we also faced some complexity in getting it smart and reliable. We
had to develop some new algorithms and we had to find a good concept of getting
a hardware with all this functionalities into a handsome nice and small design!</p>
<p>But we succeed! The first prototypes
proofed the concept and all my friends and business partners are very excited
and the pushed us to get to the next step: the development to the serial
product and to sell it to the market. </p>
<p>To go with the market and to hit the needs
of the market, we decided to use a modern funding concept and we hope that all
of you support the idea of the product!</p>

<h1>Croud-Funds for an Investment in Personal Security</h1>
<h3>Usage of the Funds </h3>
<p>The funding of the project will be used for
the 3 next stages of our project: development to a serial product, application
development and marketing. Based in UK we have access to all kinds engineering
and development facilities including a very strong software development team.
Our company staff will focus on business and market development as well as on
customer relation management – and off course on the ongoing development of the
CIREN product and functionality.</p>
<h4>Development to a Serial Product</h4>
<p>The CIREN Product is in a prototype stage
which shows the feasibility of the functionality. The core components are ready
to be transfers to large volume serial products and an automated assembly line
is ready designed. One major part of the development cost goes into a final
product design to decide for the right long lasting material with a good
optical quality and haptic. Another major part goes into quality and
reliability testing to ensure a proper function of over lifetime.</p>
<h4>Application development</h4>
<p>The mobile application is the second heart of
CIREN. The big range of different functionalities are all supported and
controlled by the mobile app. To integrate hardware functionalities with a huge
range onalities and the integration to social network, we have
designed a CIREN App Suite for a n easy access to to different main types of
functions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The development of the application is done
by our dedicated software team at a preferred software house with years of
experience in mobile applications and wearable solutions. A professional
quality assurance ensures a perfect functionality and reliability of CIREN.</p>
<h4>Sales and Marketing</h4>
<p>We are focusing on getting CIREN into a fast market entry. This needs a
multilevel marketing mainly based on three pillars: network marketing in social
networks, advertisement in video and tube sites, and other media and as third
pillar direct marketing via sales channels.</p>
<p>As distribution and sales channels we have
decided to use online shops but also local shops and shop chains and finally
gyms, PTs and dedicated organizations.</p>
<h3>Testemonials</h3>
<p>“When I heard first time about CIREN, was immediately
sure that such a product could be very useful. But when I saw the prototype I
got completely excited”.  Nicole H.</p>
<p>“We were approached by the idea of sellingCIREN in our online-stores. And after an explanation of the functionality and
the presentation of a first prototype, we agreed to step in to a test phase for
selling once the first series is available”. Johann B.</p>

OUR MISSION IS YOUR SAFETY!BUILD THE 1st WORLDWIDE NETWORK FOR RESCUE, HELP, PROTECTION AND SAFETY WITH CIREN and the CIREN APP !

Safety and help in critical situations is important for almost everyone but especially women, kids  and older people. The idea for CIREN was born in several situations of friends or colleagues were help or support was needed.  We had the idea to offer a kind of alarm connected with some helpful functions.
CIREN was invented to combine handsome design and wearable technology with the social networked and mobile applications.

The first prototype has proven that CIREN can realize the vision of a smart alarm device with huge range of functionality. The money will be used for developing CIREN to serial production, to finalize the software and iOS and Android app and to step into the market. We will settle the company in USA and Germany in parallel. Our team in CA is focusing on SW development the team in Germany on hardware and design. Our company is currently registered in UK, were we can make us of high skilled developers for commercial products in cooperating company nearby.


ALARM – FLASH – ALERT  and more….
Prevent against violence, attacks…
CIREN is your small and smart assistant which
can by a very useful help if you are getting in troubles or if you are getting
attacked.  


Help in critical situations!
The CIREN Rescue and Alarm Wearable and
Network Solution is a brand-new invention – strongly driven by the needs women,
teenager and kids but also for men in any age.
CIREN – the smart private alarm 







Imagine – you are just leaving a concert,
walking to your car.


Imagine – you are walking alone in a dark street.


Imagine – your child is out with a group of other teens.


Imagine – you forget you smart phone


Imagine –  … so many more situation when
CIREN can make the help easier and safer!


Developed based on real life experience




“I have invented the CIREN smart private
alarm based on experiences in real life. I am a black belt full contact Karate
Trainer and I am teaching women and children in self-defence. During me courses
we are discussing records and experience of the daily live and I recognized: in
more than 50% of the situation a smart alarm system could have been a perfect
prevention or help.”
The CIREN (the name comes from “Cyber” and
“Siren”) was invented as a very smart, easy to use system which can be used for
a couple of other very nice functions. But during in our development with some
UK partners, we also faced some complexity in getting it smart and reliable. We
had to develop some new algorithms and we had to find a good concept of getting
a hardware with all this functionalities into a handsome nice and small design!
But we succeed! The first prototypes
proofed the concept and all my friends and business partners are very excited
and the pushed us to get to the next step: the development to the serial
product and to sell it to the market. 
To go with the market and to hit the needs
of the market, we decided to use a modern funding concept and we hope that all
of you support the idea of the product!

<p><strong>Survivor may herald an entirely new approach to alcohol consumption - a revolutionary nutritional supplement formulation designed specifically to be taken when consuming alcohol. Survivor aims to restore productivity the day after drinking with a long term goal to mitigate some of the longer term harmful effects of alcohol consumption. </strong><br/><br/>Survivor was founded by Rocket Internet alumni Laurence Cardwell and marketing professional Richard Tidman. The science behind Survivor originates from the mind of Prof. Dr. Gertrude Kubiena, ex Vice President of the Red Cross, with a formulation developed by food scientist Simon Williams, director of one of Europes leading nutraceutical suppliers. We count a number of medical, pharmaceutical and nutritional experts amongst our senior advisor team.</p>
<p>Survivor may have the capacity to go beyond just being a capsule to chase down your G&amp;T and actually help offset some of the harm associated with alcohol consumption - and we need the data to show this to the world.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554482720/j369d0ath10lq7fln2gi.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p>

<p><br/><strong>Alcohol - a great friend and unforgiving enemy. Its invention has been tied to the beginning of civilisation by some historians, and Western culture is undeniably tied to it. And everyone knows the devastating slap of the ‘hangover’, which has been glorified as a cultural phenomenon in itself.</strong></p>
<p>However there is more to an alcohol-induced ‘hangover’ beyond mere discomfort, lying about like a limp noodle or drooling uselessly at your desk, blasting fumes of booze at your unconsenting and unamused colleagues.</p>
<p>Some concerning statistics put things into perspective: the average Brit loses a shocking 24 days of productivity per year, due to the effects of alcohol consumption. That equates to over 4 years in the average lifespan.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554133617/pakqavlgtcpj87hn9uu4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This negative effect on productivity can be difficult to accept in a world where social and professional lives often collide.</p>
<p>However, even beyond loss of productivity, there’s a far larger spectre looming: alcohol’s consequences on health. And not only when binge drinking. Say goodbye to the idea that a glass of wine is ‘healthy’ for you, and hello to the ultimate killjoy - the Global Burden of Disease Study of 2016. This meta study assessed alcohol-related health outcomes between 1990-2016 across 195 countries.<br/><br/><strong>Their conclusion: no amount of alcohol is safe.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Which is why we created Survivor.</strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.survivorlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pack.gif"" src=""""/><br/><br/> </p>

<p><br/><strong>Survivor is not a hangover cure, it is a nutritional supplement designed to reduce the likelihood of one occurring, as well as offering greater protection to health for those that choose to consume alcohol.</strong></p>
<p>Survivor features a high quality potent blend of traditional herbal extracts in combination with a bespoke blend of vitamins, minerals, electrolytes and nutrients which contribute to normal cognitive function, reduction in tiredness and fatigue, normal functioning of the nervous system, protection of cells from oxidative stress, normal energy yielding metabolism and normal psychological function.</p>
<p>Survivor is designed to be taken both whilst you drink, and before you go to sleep - helping replace the nutrients lost as a side effect to drinking alcohol, and to deliver those all important ingredients at the point they are able to make the greatest impact.<br/><br/>Given alcohol could never be made healthier, Survivor’s end goal is to make drinking less unhealthy. Our product is designed to be used as a complementary tool to a responsible approach to alcohol consumption.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554480437/rcxq1e75givf6euxfsql.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><br/><strong>Our formulation is designed to be consumed when drinking alcohol and contains a blend of nutrients focussed on supporting a number of hepatic, cognitive and metabolic functions which can be affected or impaired through elevated blood alcohol levels.</strong><br/> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>While dehydration, fatigue, glucose imbalances, gastrointestinal acidity, and so forth contribute to ‘hangovers’, the main criminal is alcohol’s first metabolite, the inflammatory toxin acetaldehyde which is over 40x more toxic than alcohol itself. Its crimes: headaches, facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate and increased blood pressure.</p>
<p>This is where Survivor’s high concentrations of truly revolutionary ingredients stand out: Dihydromyricetin and <i>Puerariae lobatae Flos</i>. Used for thousands of years in traditional medicine as hangover treatments, they are now coming to the attention of Western medicine for their ability to accelerate the breakdown of acetaldehyde, mitigating its significant inflammatory impact.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554145390/hxdumhmp3eybwfpdjky3.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p><br/>In addition to these two fascinating ingredients, Survivor contains a complementary blend of additional nutrients focussed on supporting your body in its response to alcohol consumption.<br/><br/>We've included ingredients with a view to improving your quality of sleep, protecting against oxidative stress - which leads to inflammation in the body, helping your body maintain normal cognitive function and normal energy yielding metabolism - as well as replenishing your reserves of various vitamins, some of which can be depleted when consuming alcohol.</p>

<p><br/><br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our greater mission however, is to seek ways to mitigate the negative impact alcohol has on the body. This is why Prof. Dr. Kubiena, a former Vice-President of the Red Cross, stated that <strong>“…the potential long-term health consequences of Survivor could be enormous,” </strong>envisioning Survivor as something to top off every drinking occasion, from the high tempo night on the town, to those two civilised glasses of wine over dinner.</span></p>
<p>And this is why Business Insider wrote that “Survivor may herald an entirely new approach to more responsible alcohol consumption,” effectively <strong>“short-circuiting some of the damage caused by alcohol as part of a holistic long-term approach to health.”</strong><br/><br/> </p>

<strong>Secondly, in order to bring Survivor to a wider audience, we plan to invest in marketing and distribution for our product.</strong> We have an e-Commerce website ready for launch on completion of this campaign, however in order to gain greater exposure for our mission and Survivor as a product, we plan to undertake marketing activity which will bring Survivor to an increasingly larger audience - subject to the amount we raise.

</div></div>","Survivor may herald an entirely new approach to alcohol consumption - a revolutionary nutritional supplement formulation designed specifically to be taken when consuming alcohol. Survivor aims to restore productivity the day after drinking with a long term goal to mitigate some of the longer term harmful effects of alcohol consumption. Survivor was founded by Rocket Internet alumni Laurence Cardwell and marketing professional Richard Tidman. The science behind Survivor originates from the mind of Prof. Dr. Gertrude Kubiena, ex Vice President of the Red Cross, with a formulation developed by food scientist Simon Williams, director of one of Europes leading nutraceutical suppliers. We count a number of medical, pharmaceutical and nutritional experts amongst our senior advisor team.
Survivor may have the capacity to go beyond just being a capsule to chase down your G&T and actually help offset some of the harm associated with alcohol consumption - and we need the data to show this to the world. 

Alcohol - a great friend and unforgiving enemy. Its invention has been tied to the beginning of civilisation by some historians, and Western culture is undeniably tied to it. And everyone knows the devastating slap of the ‘hangover’, which has been glorified as a cultural phenomenon in itself.
However there is more to an alcohol-induced ‘hangover’ beyond mere discomfort, lying about like a limp noodle or drooling uselessly at your desk, blasting fumes of booze at your unconsenting and unamused colleagues.
Some concerning statistics put things into perspective: the average Brit loses a shocking 24 days of productivity per year, due to the effects of alcohol consumption. That equates to over 4 years in the average lifespan.
 
This negative effect on productivity can be difficult to accept in a world where social and professional lives often collide.
However, even beyond loss of productivity, there’s a far larger spectre looming: alcohol’s consequences on health. And not only when binge drinking. Say goodbye to the idea that a glass of wine is ‘healthy’ for you, and hello to the ultimate killjoy - the Global Burden of Disease Study of 2016. This meta study assessed alcohol-related health outcomes between 1990-2016 across 195 countries.Their conclusion: no amount of alcohol is safe.
Which is why we created Survivor. 

Survivor is not a hangover cure, it is a nutritional supplement designed to reduce the likelihood of one occurring, as well as offering greater protection to health for those that choose to consume alcohol.
Survivor features a high quality potent blend of traditional herbal extracts in combination with a bespoke blend of vitamins, minerals, electrolytes and nutrients which contribute to normal cognitive function, reduction in tiredness and fatigue, normal functioning of the nervous system, protection of cells from oxidative stress, normal energy yielding metabolism and normal psychological function.
Survivor is designed to be taken both whilst you drink, and before you go to sleep - helping replace the nutrients lost as a side effect to drinking alcohol, and to deliver those all important ingredients at the point they are able to make the greatest impact.Given alcohol could never be made healthier, Survivor’s end goal is to make drinking less unhealthy. Our product is designed to be used as a complementary tool to a responsible approach to alcohol consumption. 

 

Our formulation is designed to be consumed when drinking alcohol and contains a blend of nutrients focussed on supporting a number of hepatic, cognitive and metabolic functions which can be affected or impaired through elevated blood alcohol levels. 

 
While dehydration, fatigue, glucose imbalances, gastrointestinal acidity, and so forth contribute to ‘hangovers’, the main criminal is alcohol’s first metabolite, the inflammatory toxin acetaldehyde which is over 40x more toxic than alcohol itself. Its crimes: headaches, facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate and increased blood pressure.
This is where Survivor’s high concentrations of truly revolutionary ingredients stand out: Dihydromyricetin and Puerariae lobatae Flos. Used for thousands of years in traditional medicine as hangover treatments, they are now coming to the attention of Western medicine for their ability to accelerate the breakdown of acetaldehyde, mitigating its significant inflammatory impact. 
 
In addition to these two fascinating ingredients, Survivor contains a complementary blend of additional nutrients focussed on supporting your body in its response to alcohol consumption.We've included ingredients with a view to improving your quality of sleep, protecting against oxidative stress - which leads to inflammation in the body, helping your body maintain normal cognitive function and normal energy yielding metabolism - as well as replenishing your reserves of various vitamins, some of which can be depleted when consuming alcohol.
 

Our greater mission however, is to seek ways to mitigate the negative impact alcohol has on the body. This is why Prof. Dr. Kubiena, a former Vice-President of the Red Cross, stated that “…the potential long-term health consequences of Survivor could be enormous,” envisioning Survivor as something to top off every drinking occasion, from the high tempo night on the town, to those two civilised glasses of wine over dinner.
And this is why Business Insider wrote that “Survivor may herald an entirely new approach to more responsible alcohol consumption,” effectively “short-circuiting some of the damage caused by alcohol as part of a holistic long-term approach to health.”

<p>I have been competing on Corky Sikes Team Strike Force for the past 2 years.  I love karate and competing.  I spend hours everyday practicing so that I can beat the best in the world to BE the best.  My favorite part of karate is weapons. And my weapon of choice... my nunchucks! If you watched my video, then you saw the trick I posted.  I learned that trick just a week before that video was taken!</p>
<p>Karate has helped me become more disciplined in everything I do and it has helped me learn the values of hard work and respect.  It's more than a sport, it's my lifestyle.</p>
<p>With the wins that I have from this past season and with YOUR donations I hope to be able to compete in one of the biggest sport karate tournamemts in the world...World Super Grands in Buffalo, New York in December!  I work to help pay for the costs of my tournements but this one is the furthest away and the most expensive on the circuit and I really need your help to get me there!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The details:</h2>
<p>Sport karate, as with most every competive sport, is pretty expensive. However, this tournamnet is the most expensive tournament of the year.  We are goaling for $2000 in funds, which is about half of our estimated costs for 3 of us ( Calista, myself and her little sister) will need to attend, to help us get Calista to this world competition.</p>
<p> The World Super Grands will be from December 26th through December 31st. Between travel (airefare for 3), hotel (7 nights), food and most importantly tournament registration these costs add up very quickly </p>
<p>Your donations will not only help Calista compete on a world stage against the BEST athletes in sport karate but it will also help to promote the benefits of karate for kids.  We all need something to be passionate about...Calista is passionate about karate.  It feeds into every aspect of her life.  The positive benefits have been more than I could have ever imagined.  Help us get her to her dream of competing at World Super Grands!</p>

<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking interest in my project.</p>
<p>My name is Morgana, and I want to make and distribute homemade tea with creative themes. I am from California and I have always enjoyed tea and the thought of creating my own.</p>

<h3>Hello,</h3>
<h3>I am writing this for my friend Nicole. I watched her get married 4 years ago and was there for the birth of her daughter just 1 and 1/2 years ago. She is 32 and was diagnosed with an aggressive form of IIB breast cancer in the middle of October 2011. On Halloween she had a double radical mastectomy and had to have 42 lymphnodes removed. The doctors told her that this would just be the beginning of many obstacles. She had no clue that shortly after she started her chemotherapy treatments her husband would decide that he did not love her anymore and chose to leave her. In the midst of the worst time in her life she had to move out of thier home of 6 years and try to make it through everything alone. She had to do 4 months of harsh chemo followed by 6 weeks of radiation therapy. During this time I saw how devestated and sick she was. Though, she is done with her treatments she still needs to have 2 surgeries. She needs her breast reconstrustion and will need a hysterectomy since she is positive for the breast cancer gene.</h3>
<h3>
<strong>I am trying to raise this money for Nicole and her daughter because I have been there and watched her struggle to make ends meet. She is one of the most caring people I know and has always been there for me. Nicole has had a lot of medical bills and there are still many more to come. </strong>She is trying to get her life back in order after losing her boobs, her husband, her home, her dog and her hair. She has been very courageous through all of this and I just want to bring some happiness back into her life and help her pay some of these bills since she also had to miss a ton of work. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I know Nicole will appreciate every prayer and penny. </h3>

<h3>I'm Gina - President of GinaSpriggs.Guru.</h3>
<p>I am a Holistic Intuitive and Mentor who helps align people with their intuition, power and purpose so they can help themselves and those around them.</p>
<p>I am widely known for my <i>Sacred Journey Mastery Program</i> and <i>Enlightened Business Mastery Program</i> that helps people harness their intuitive Super Powers and create successful businesses.</p>
<p>As a Master Tarologist with over 30 years’ experience, and proud owner of over 400 tarot and oracle decks, I've also authored <i>The Intuitive Tarot Workbook - the first tarot workbook that helps you develop a relationship with each of your decks.</i></p>

<p>After being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, the topic of healing became a personal journey. I studied quantum physics, shamanism, chakra healing, medical intuition, plant spirit medicine, crystal healing, healing with sound, and a host of other modalities – which I combined with my intuitive wisdom and condensed it to its basic form, to share through experiential programs. </p>
<p>But it wasn't until the 2016 cancer related deaths around me (I refer to them in the video), that I was inspired to the Lumin8 Healing Oracle tool.</p>
<p><strong>Through the Lumin8 Healing Oracle, my goal is to bring a heightened level of awareness and personal power through the book, live event, group program. The Lumin8 Healing Oracle Deck </strong>is my largest project to date.</p>
<p>“<i>Knowledge is something learned from a book, or gained from a teacher.

<p><i>The deck is available to those who donate $55 or more.</i></p>
<p><strong>The Book</strong></p>
<p>The full sized 5.5” x 8.5” book is an abbreviated version of the actual program. It comes complete with exercises. There are fourteen chapters that simple yet powerful, “how to’s”, insights, and resources.</p>

And they also agree that the five fundamental vectors - <b>Cadence</b>, <b>Ground Contact Time</b>, <b>Foot Strike</b>, <b>Body Balance</b> and <b>Impact Stress</b> - form the key to good running form.</p>
<p>Stridalyzer Smart Insoles, coupled with Stridalyzer Analytics and guidance solutions, is the ONLY solution that measures, analyzes and provides you an insight into all these vectors, and provides a proprietary rating system, that we call the ""<b>5-Star System</b>"".</p>

I had a blast run testing a pair of RetiSense.com Stridalyzer insoles last week for my upcoming Austin Fit magazine gear review. If you’re a runner or triathlete, you’d be wise to check them out.

Stridalyzer on the news


                                                      







The Sensor-Packed Insoles

                      


  Stridalyzer uses a pair of insoles with a novel, patent-pending technology with multiple sensors integrated in them, to detect how your foot lands, rolls and pushes off the ground. All you need to do is put these insoles in your shoes, turn the app on, and start running; Stridalyzer automatically understands that you are moving, and will start collecting data about your run.

                    

Stridalyzer App
Stridalyzer App has in its core, a patent-pending, real-time biomechanics engine, that uses sensor data from the insoles and your biometric information, to model your lower limb and exactly how it is moving over the ground or in the air, what forces are acting on various parts of the leg, as well as determining whether that is appropriate or inappropriate kind of motion or stress. Through this analysis, Stridalyzer App can provide an extremely powerful mechanism to understand how your body is performing in real-time! Some of the salient features of the app are described below.


Real-Time Impact Stress distribution display for feet and knees!
Real-Time Alerts for inappropriate stances and movement, excessive stress, etc.
Real-Time visibility into various parameters like Stride Length, Stride Rate (Cadence), Ground Contact Time.
Visibility into your foot-strike pattern.
And finally, our proprietary 5-star rating system for your running form, at the end of your run!

</p><p>Rosco Asana’s students are fully comfortable to be
themselves as they strive to create healthy habits in their lives. Rosco is
gifted in spreading joy and laughter, allowing play to be more productive and
work to lose its edge. He creates a space of empowerment and creativity where
individuals can enjoy growing and learning about their health and their place
in the world. Rosco humbly seeks to lead a colorful, vibrant life, and enables others to do the same at any age. He believes that
one of the first steps toward such a life is an open mind and strong body that
is capable of much activity.</p>
<p>“Each day I pray for
supernatural levels of energy that I can share with the people around me to
accomplish great things.”</p>
<p>Rosco has a professional background in personal training
from Auburn University where he worked for four years at the Student Activities
Center (2009-2013). He is certified through the American Council on Exercise.
His yoga path began in 2010 when he was seeking to bring balance into his life
after a period of disordered eating and exercise. After practicing for
two years, he saw and felt changes in his life that he wanted to perpetuate and
share with others. He became a certified teacher in 2012 through YogaFit. Since
that time he has taught at the Auburn University Student Activities Center as
well as exotic destinations in Costa Rica and Panama. His practice of yoga
affects the way he sees health and fitness overall; this is reflected in his
unique style of personal training. Rosco puts much emphasis on physical
fitness, but does neglect the mind and spirit.</p><p>Rosco graduated from Auburn University in August 2013 with a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. He currently serves as an apprentice under Kimberly Sotelo at Inner Sunshine Yoga and Wellness in Opelika, Alabama. Over the course of three years, he will study to become a better instructor, teach classes, and develop holistic personal training as a business. </p><p><a href=""http://innersunshineyoga.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://innersunshineyoga.com/</a><br/></p><p>""Helping people to feel better and discover their full potential is my passion and purpose in this life, so I want to put more time and energy into that mission.  I want  to offer more to my clients and secure a steady income for myself and the wellness center through Holistic Personal Training.

Rosco Asana’s students are fully comfortable to be
themselves as they strive to create healthy habits in their lives. Rosco is
gifted in spreading joy and laughter, allowing play to be more productive and
work to lose its edge. He creates a space of empowerment and creativity where
individuals can enjoy growing and learning about their health and their place
in the world. Rosco humbly seeks to lead a colorful, vibrant life, and enables others to do the same at any age. He believes that
one of the first steps toward such a life is an open mind and strong body that
is capable of much activity.
“Each day I pray for
supernatural levels of energy that I can share with the people around me to
accomplish great things.”
Rosco has a professional background in personal training
from Auburn University where he worked for four years at the Student Activities
Center (2009-2013). He is certified through the American Council on Exercise.
His yoga path began in 2010 when he was seeking to bring balance into his life
after a period of disordered eating and exercise. After practicing for
two years, he saw and felt changes in his life that he wanted to perpetuate and
share with others. He became a certified teacher in 2012 through YogaFit. Since
that time he has taught at the Auburn University Student Activities Center as
well as exotic destinations in Costa Rica and Panama. His practice of yoga
affects the way he sees health and fitness overall; this is reflected in his
unique style of personal training. Rosco puts much emphasis on physical
fitness, but does neglect the mind and spirit.Rosco graduated from Auburn University in August 2013 with a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. He currently serves as an apprentice under Kimberly Sotelo at Inner Sunshine Yoga and Wellness in Opelika, Alabama. Over the course of three years, he will study to become a better instructor, teach classes, and develop holistic personal training as a business. http://innersunshineyoga.com/""Helping people to feel better and discover their full potential is my passion and purpose in this life, so I want to put more time and energy into that mission.  I want  to offer more to my clients and secure a steady income for myself and the wellness center through Holistic Personal Training. Your contributions will help me to jump-start my business by transforming my training space to accommodate more forms of exercise and a broader range of fitness goals.""What We Need & What You GetI have experience, confidence, a vision, and a space.

<p>These

manipulation of skin through surgery or tattooing. None of which have

<p>The good news is that the odds of breast cancer survival are increasing.  Women are finding breast cancer earlier than ever and beating it.  This means that “quality of life” issues after a mastectomy are becoming more and more important.</p>
<p>Whether we want to admit it or not, the way we look or are perceived by others affects each of us.  The psychological impact of going through cancer, surviving, and then being left with breasts that feel incomplete can be crushing. </p>

<p>The
concept is to take a woman’s cells and place them into a 3D bio-printer,
reinventing a woman’s own nipple with the desired shape and color.  The intended result of our research is a nipple that can be
placed onto her reconstructed breasts, creating the look
of the real thing. Using a woman’s own cells also reduces the risk of
rejection, creating less trauma and pain for her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we are still in research and development for our products.  After we complete that phase we will need to perform clinical trials.  Clinical trials are critical to ensure patients receive high quality and safe results.  We are estimating 5-6 years before the product is broadly available.  But we are working as fast as we can! </p>

TeVido BioDevices and learn about progress with the technology visit www.tevidobiodevices.com and sign up for our
mailing list.Once
again, thank you for making a statement of your solidarity with breast cancer
survivors that the long term, quality of life is imperative. 








This is why we fight to move forward.
Your contributions go to help people like the mother and daughter duo in the video above. Annie's mother has fought cancer 3 different times and has not only survived, but has been able to be there for her daughter through her own struggle with cancer. Annie was a fit, healthy 40 year old that found a lump and was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Annie elected to have breast reconstruction. The results, while certainly positive compared to the alternative, are not nearly as satisfying as they could be.







Building a Better Nipple for Survivors






Those
who are survivors of breast cancer and have had breast reconstruction already
know why this is so important.



These
days, the choices for recreating anything close to a nipple include
manipulation of skin through surgery or tattooing. None of which have
guaranteed lasting results, and all of which are less than aesthetically
satisfactory. 

Cancer hits all of us. 
           ~Or will at some point. 

The good news is that the odds of breast cancer survival are increasing.  Women are finding breast cancer earlier than ever and beating it.  This means that “quality of life” issues after a mastectomy are becoming more and more important.
Whether we want to admit it or not, the way we look or are perceived by others affects each of us.  The psychological impact of going through cancer, surviving, and then being left with breasts that feel incomplete can be crushing. 

There is power in feeling “whole”.  Having nipples creates a connection to that part of us that needs to feel “normal” again.  This creates ripples and waves that influence every relationship we have, including most importantly, our relationship with ourselves.
Creating “wholeness” where there are holes.



Enter TeVido BioDevices.   
TeVido BioDevices is developing cutting-edge 3D bio-printing techniques and combining that with advances in cellular technology to create custom nipple grafts that would match the size and shape of a woman's original nipple.

Watch
this  Cover Story for more insight:



The
concept is to take a woman’s cells and place them into a 3D bio-printer,
reinventing a woman’s own nipple with the desired shape and color.  The intended result of our research is a nipple that can be
placed onto her reconstructed breasts, creating the look
of the real thing. Using a woman’s own cells also reduces the risk of
rejection, creating less trauma and pain for her.
Hope is here.
You
can help us to bring awareness and much needed funding for this revolutionary
new technology and research.



 


 
Taking hope in a new direction.

~The convergence of 3D bio-printing with cellular technology.
Here's how it will work:

Are you asking yourself, ""how the heck did this get started?""  
Here's a Peek at the Science Behind Bio-Printing.





 

Help us to help your mothers, wives, daughters, girlfriends, sisters, friends… YOU.

           ~Spread the word and the wealth for
a worthy cause.

 


You
can make this happen.  Right now it’s
still just a dream, but you can make it a reality. 




 

What do we need?

The great news is that right now a portion
of our research and development (R&D) is funded by the National Science
Foundation (NSF) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  We have been awarded over $900,000  in grant funding. This makes a huge difference for us.  


But this doesn't cover certain critical costs that we face in the next few months.
We need your help.
 

Goal - $35,000


Our goal is to raise $35,000 with
this campaign to cover costs associated with patents.  I
know it doesn't seem exciting... but without it... we won't be able to help
the women who have survived breast cancer.   Patents are about protecting  ideas.  And we need them to be viable.
Through
your funding, you can water this seed and help us grow.  In doing so, you will be helping us to
develop strong roots and impact the way and direction this technology
grows.  
TeVido BioDevices knows that there are so many causes out
there pleading for your time, attention, and money.  We are so grateful that you would consider
donating to our hopeful cause, whether it’s with your money or time.  Donating your time to help us get the word out is a big deal and a big help so be sure to pass on our story to your friends and family.
Be
a part of Hope’s future.  
Reconstruct Hope… one nipple at a time.

 

We have had extensive press coverage.




The road to innovative discovery is endless…and TeVido is paving the way. Come join us on a journey that has limitless potential, and unlimited applications.





 

Looking ahead.


Can you imagine where this will lead?  What we can accomplish together?  The ways this will improve lives?

We are answering all questions that we receive on our blog. This includes:



a description of the QuASP™ application


technical Q&A session video 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After launching the QuASP™ at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2013, we are now introducing it to the rest of the world. 
Get to know the most precise wearable motion- and position tracker for teams and individuals. See how the collected is visualized through the accompanying application for iOS and Android. 
We've developed both the hardware and software together with sports scientists and physiotherapists at Sensorize who work with pro and elite sporters like Christiano Ronaldo and olympic athletes on a daily basis, so you are assured to get the absolute best.






QuASP™ Light
The QuASP™ light is the precise entry level motion and outdoor position tracker. Working together with the QuASP™ light iPhone and Android app it provides:

Energetic cost of training
3D Acceleration/Deceleration patterns (very important in racing)
Quantification of reactivity in the change of direction (describing ""dodging"" skills)
Sport team tactic analysis
Athletic resume service (the player's profile will show the progress made over time)

QuASP™ light is ideal for: Keen sportsmen at any level for any outdoor precision sport (like golf), ball game (for example tennis, soccer, football, cricket), urban sports (outdoor basketball), etc. 




Simply place the device in one of the specially made QuASP™ vests or put it in your pocket.






QuASP™ Pro

The QuASP™ Pro provides all the services offered by the QuASP™ Light in real-time, thanks to an additional hardware component, the QuASP™ access point. Apart from the aforementioned services, the QuASP™ Pro offers:


real-time quantification of shocks during tackles or impacts
real-time tracking of the whole team
simultaneous access from multiple client applications running on tablets, smartphones and PCs
synchronization with video streaming for video analysis (camera not included)

In addition to that, the QuASP™ Pro exposes APIs for just any kind of position and motion tracking applications such as interactive scoreboard augmentation of spectators' experience with real-time predictions of plays' success. For instance, if you know the trajectory and speed of a runner and the defenders, you can easily anticipate the chance of a touchdown. 


QuASP™ Pro is ideal for: Sportsclubs and health centers to offer quantification services to their members; for college teams; schools; and all pro and semi-pro teams. 

QuASP™ Premium
An optional additional service for remote data storage and historical data access and analysis
QuASP™ Premium is ideal for: Semi-pro and professional teams, sport scouts, sport institutions, research centers, physiotherapists

_________________________________

Free Stuff!
We're reimbursing a number of eligible people with the full amount of a QuASP™ device if they are selected to place a small precision device on their property to provide even more accuracy for devices their radius. 
If you are interested in this special promotion you can sign up after you've pledged for at least 1 QuASP™ device. 

_________________________________

Individuals & Teams

We are all familiar with the runners watches and the motivational calorie trackers, but the QuASP™ goes further. Not only does it provide sophisticated inch-accurate positioning technology but also the possibility to track whole teams at the same time through the accompanying application. You can even use the QuASP™ devices on multiple body parts to measure which leg is capable of scoring a more powerful goal. 






Individuals like golfers and skiers will benefit from the 200+ measurements taken per second and the fact that you can wear multiple QuASP™ on your body.



Training
Plan your training or workout session according to your latest achievements. Whether it's practising that back-hand, or doing endurance training focussed on your left arm. Examine exactly what it is that your body needs.


Matches & games

Each player's movements are shown on the team-page so that you can see whether tactics are implemented and who's stamina is decreasing and should be replaced.  You can even plug in a camera and see position, video and player data all at the same time.

Injury prevention & recovery

Measure exactly when you're at risk for injury by using the concussion alerts based on the impact measurements. Or compare how you have been performing after an injury vs before. This is also valuable information for treatment by your physiotherapist.


(Heart rate monitoring device not included)
_________________________________
Why QuASP™?
Powerful
The QuASP™ is the result of years of research in the fields of motion tracking, precise positioning and sensor networks. Thanks to Beestar's patent-pending technologies, the QuASP™ provides serious sports lovers with the tools they need.

Intuitive
We're using the latest standards and best practices in user experience design so whether you're an Android or iOS user, the application will be easy to use.

Pro-grade
Professional athletes have access to a team of trained physiotherapists to understand the risk of injury; trainers to pick up on any improvements that need to be made; and coaches to develop tactics based on the team's performance. QuASP™ includes all this information!


Key Features
QuASP™ is a different kind of sport sensor than what the market is offering. The sports devices like watches and apps out there focus mainly on runners, but those who practice any other sport like precision sports or ball games have substantially different requirements. This is why we've jam-packed the QuASP™ with features that will appeal to all sports. 






Team/group page. With each device comes a free, personalized page for your team (or just for you). 


Track multiple bodyparts. Each device gives access to measurements, so if you want to track multiple bodyparts all you need to do is wear them.


Easy upload. For QuASP™ light your data will be uploaded as soon as you are connected to wifi. Automatically. With Pro your data will be streamed live.

200+ measurements per second. Did I mention we're pro-grade? One of the reasons we're so accurate is because of the high volume of data.
Multi-platform. Connect to your page using Android or iOS using tablets, laptops or phones.

Use for all types of sport. Measurements of speed, acceleration and position are applicable to different types of sports.

Video. Plug in a camera and view footage, tactics and player metrics all at the same time. You can even play, fast forward or rewind.

Real-time. View a training or match as it's happening through streaming the collected data live (this is a pro feature)


Sleek design. We've teamed up with physiotherapists and sports scientists as well as highly experienced Italian design firms to develop the beautiful casing. It's sturdy but because of its soft touch casing and flowing design it fits perfectly on any part of the body. We had comfort and safety in mind first and foremost.

He has brought tremendous joy to the world through his music. He must go to a different state from where he currently lives for this operation. Living expenses will be large for the 6-8 months he will be there. There will be many out of pocket expenses that insurance will not cover. Please help if you can.  Thanks!
Slick has been the lead guitarist in Jefferson Starship  since 1992 and is only the 3rd person to hold that position in the 40 year history of both Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship. This year marks 28 years Slick has played with Paul Kantner, Marty Balin, and Company since he started with The KBC band in 1984. Before that he was lead guitarist with DAVID CROSBY and before that, KC & THE SUNSHINE BAND. His lead guitar has soared the music of JEFFERSON AIRPLANE & JEFFERSON STARSHIP far longer than the AIRPLANE’s legendary JORMA KAUKONEN and STARSHIP’s CRAIG CHAQUICO combined.

<strong>Goal-</strong><span> </span>
</h2>
<div>To build a CPU/GPU folding computer for the sole purpose of donating its time (24/7/365) to cancer research.
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2><strong>Background-</strong></h2>
<p>The World Community Grid project (<a href=""http://www.worldcommunitygrid.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.worldcommunitygrid.com</a>) is an IBM-run project that allows home users to participate and donate their own computer's time towards medical and humanitarian research. Medical research projects are normally carried out through computer simulations, in which varying combinations of proteins and compounds are broken down, combined, tested and calculated. These computer simulations allow medical researchers to compute and profile vast amounts of possible chemical reactions, model proteins, etc. </p>
<p>The ability to process and compute these simulations is a massive undertaking and requires a vast amount of computational power, far beyond what any one home computer could ever provide. These types of projects would typically be reserved for supercomputers in laboratories. The problem with supercomputers is that they cost a lot of money to run. It may only take a supercomputer a couple of weeks or a month to run a medical research project, but the cost to rent the time on a supercomputer could be millions of dollars. Unfortunately, for some of these medical projects, which often endeavor to find cures to some of today's most devistating ailments, it's not always possible to attain that kind of funding. </p>
<p>This is where WCG (World Community Grid) comes into play. While a single home computer is nowhere near powerful enough to process a project like this on its own, when tied together to a grid of 1000's of other computers it's possible. WCG works by allowing the home user to download an application that runs on their personal computer. This application connects to the IBM client and downloads individual WU (workunits) to process. These workunits are individual tasks that your home computer will then run on the WCG program. Each task is one workunit. It might take anywhere from 1 minute (for GPU enabled tasks) to 6 hours to complete a workunit. Upon completing that workunit it will then be uploaded back to the WCG server where the research team on that project will have access to the results. In effect, the single task completed by your personal home computer will help researchers  work towards finding cures.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>Help Conquer Cancer Project-</strong> </h2>
<p>Project Help Conquer Cancer (<a href=""http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/hcc1/overview.do"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/hcc1/overview.do</a>) is focused solely on Cancer research. Its mission is to improve the results of protein X-ray crystallography, which helps researchers not only annotate unknown parts of the human proteome, but importantly improves their understanding of cancer initiation, progression and treatment.</p>
<p>HCC (Help Conquer Cancer) has been going on since 2007 (<a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~juris/WCG/wcg-hcc.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~juris/WCG/wcg-hcc.html</a>), and since that time has used the work and research completed to assist in the publication of numerous papers in the field of cancer research. These publications and findings are one of the key elements in working towards finding a cure for cancer. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Requirements-</strong></h2>
<p>While any computer can join the World Community Grid project to contribute, the faster your computer, the faster you complete workunits, and thusly the faster you can process and return results to research teams. That said, my goal is to build a relatively high-end computer with the latest hardware capable of processing workunits in the fastest possible time. </p>
<p>To build this computer, I'll research the best components for this specific task and then order the parts needed online (<a href=""http://newegg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">newegg.com</a>). Once the parts arrive, I'll build a computer, configure the software, overclock the hardware (to attain the fastest possible processing) and connect the computer to the World Community Grid project, where it will start processing for the Help Conquer Cancer project.</p>
<p>Here is my parts list for the proposed CPU/GPU folding computer- </p>
<ul>
<li>Processor-Ivy Bridge 3770k</li>
<li>Graphics Processor- HD7970</li>
<li>Power Supply- Platinum 650 Watt</li>
<li>Motherboard ASUS Z77</li>
<li>RAM- Kingston 8GB</li>

<h2>
<strong>Why am I asking for help-  </strong> </h2>
<p>The cost to build this computer is about $1,350, but once running the ongoing cost for electricity will be a considerable amount. I currently already have a cluster computer/CPU folding farm which I built last year that's purpose is to compute 24/7/365. This cluster computer costs roughly $80 dollars per month in electricity on its own or about $1,000 for the year. This first computer was also built with the intention of donating its time. I have considered whatever costs associated in building and operating it an ongoing donation.</p>
<p>This new CPU/GPU folding farm would focus its efforts on strictly Cancer research. The estimated cost for electricity to run the computer is projected at around $60 monthly or around $720 yearly. Combined with the cost of the computer this makes the total cost of the project around $2,000 for the first year, and then $700-800 a year in electricity for each year thereafter.</p>
<p>I'm asking for your help in financing the project because I wanted to contribute more towards finding a cure for cancer, and I wanted to give others the opportunity also contribute towards a good cause. We've all been affected in one way or another by cancer at some point in our lives. There are not many options for us regular people to help with the medical research needed to find a cure. But this project offers just that, a way to help build a computer that will process medical research for cancer.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>My Computer Building Experience-  </strong></h2>
<p>I've been a proponent and advocate of World Community Grid for a while now, and as a result of this I built my own CPU folding farm last year to contribute it's time and processing power to the many humanitarian and medical research projects on World Community Grid. This computer is a cluster computer that combined 3 computers into one to produce a very powerful machine capable of processing a lot of data. Since last July this computer has already donated almost 30 years of processing time (this is possible in just a year's time because this computer can process 24 workunits at one time, so for every single day of processing it completes almost a month worth of processing for a regular computer) Details on this computer are available here on my website- <a href=""http://www.totalgeekdom.com/?p=572"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.totalgeekdom.com/?p=572</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What your pledges will be used for-   </strong></h2>
<p>Your pledges of money will go towards the purchase of the components needed to build this computer and also towards the costs of electricity to run this computer. All money donated will go into an account just for this computer, and all money beyond the component costs will be used to fund the electricity costs to run the computer. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>My Contribution-</strong></h2>
My contribution towards this project will be researching the computer components, buying the components, building the computer, setting up the computer to run World Community Grid and then maintaining the computer with necessary updates and maintenance. Furthermore, I will pay for the electricity costs to continue running it. I'll send out email updates and post information for everyone to see throughout the life of the computer, showing the results of everyone's contributions. 
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>How you can follow the progress of the project</strong>-  </h2>
<p>I'll send out email updates to everyone that contributes with a status on the project weekly. This will keep everyone abreast of its current progress. I'll take pictures of the build process as well as post the pictures along with a completed write-up on my website. Once the computer is up and running and processing, I'll send out an update with that information. From there I will send out follow-up emails letting everyone know the status of the machine, how much time we've donated, how many workunits we've completed, etc. I'll also send out progress updates from the Help Conquer Cancer project, so everyone knows exactly how our contribution is helping in finding a cure.</p>
<p>(An update to this section- 11/5/2012 Just came to mind that not everyone would necessarily want updates, which is totally fine. I'll send an email out to all contributors upon the completion of the project and people can choose to opt into email updates if they want, or decline updates if they would not like them. Don't want anyone to feel like they'll be getting spammed if they donate, the email updates will be optional)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Additional Info-</h2>
<p>While I'm really hoping to be able to reach the project funding goal and build a high-end CPU/GPU computer just for cancer research, I realize that I might not make it all the way to my goal. In that case, any money raised will still go towards this project. I will still build a dedicated computer just for cancer research using whatever funds I've raised from this fundraiser, whether it's buying parts or paying for the electrical costs to operate it.</p>

<h2>Meet Rich</h2>
A month before his 30th birthday, our athletic and driven younger brother Richard Holland was <a href=""http://backonyourbike.com/richs-accident/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">knocked off his bicycle</a> by a car and sustained life threatening injuries. Whilst training for an upcoming Iron Man and despite excellent safety precautions, Rich was hit from behind by a car, sustaining multiple life-threatening injuries. These included: broken ribs, punctured lungs, a fractured sternum, fractured right fibula, and severe injuries to his brain. His brain injuries are substantial, the worst of which is a contusion on his brain stem which caused an immediate coma. After months of heartbreak, waiting and praying, he slowly made his way through his coma and began to regain consciousness. 10 months later, his condition is relatively stable, but he is extremely compromised. Rich has what is known as a severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and the specific condition he has been left with is known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Locked-in Syndrome</a>.<p></p>
<p>His brain has a loss of motor messages sent to his body and this means he is unable to move his body at all, and is unable to communicate, except through a blinking eye and a spelling board. Only time and intense neuro rehab will tell if this motor control will be regained. </p>
<p>This is obviously very frustrating and frightening for him, but his spirit and strength is evident, he tackles each day with grace, patience, courage , plenty of laughs and a contagious smile.</p>

<h2>The Sim Bike</h2>
A Sim Bike is a Rehabilitation Therapy system,that has the ability for both Leg and Arm cycling.
<p>
By replicating the cycle motion, the legs, trunk and arms are stimulated and up to 10-16 major muscle groups are engaged and activated.The benefits of this include the reversal of muscle atrophy, improved circulation, an increased range of motion and the reduction of muscle spasms.
</p>
<p>
This is what Rich's mum had to say about it:
<i>""That is the ultimate dream for Rich. When I showed him the pic of the bike and explained to him how it works and what it does to help stimulate so many pathways simultaneously, he just cried. He is so desperate to do something physical.""</i>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Gratitude</h2>
The fundraising is a pivotal part of Rich's success. Most of his extensive rehabilitation is being funded privately by our family. We want to give him the best chance of recovery - and that means giving him the best equipment and rehab team we can afford.<p></p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your contribution. You are AWESOME and the latest member of #TeamRich. Your assistance is greatly appreciated and Rich is so lucky to have your support. People like you make the world a better place.</p>
<p>We will keep you updated with how our Bikram challenge is progressing, and please continue to be apart of Rich's progress and journey ahead.</p>

<p>My name is Alexandra and I'm a young girl who has been struggling to live her life the last 6 years. I have been diagnosed with endometriosis,stomach ulcers, chronic pain, chronic kidney stones, and i am still undergoing tests and seeing many doctors for sickness that doctors can not seem to understand which causes me to faint, be extremely weak,difficulty breathing, and extreme pains in my head. I have very brittle bones. I have a bone disorder where the calcium in my bones goes to my kidneys instead which creates large kidney stones. My endometriosis is slowly taking over and some people take this disease lightly not knowing it is actually a benign form of cancer.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I was taken out of school sophmore year of highschool due to medical issues. I was unable to function and had already missed many days of school. I couldn't live like the other kids could. I still beat myself up thinking about how I couldn't finish something so easy. I tried a simple charter school and was also taken out of that as well. I tried working and was fired for fainting and missing many days. I just can't seem to live life like a regular child. I have been feeling so elderly and depressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To make matters worse, my insurance is getting ready to end. I will not be able to see the doctors I need to or get the medicine which helps with my pain and nausea and other problems that come along with my sickness.</p>
<p>I was in bed for 2 years and no longer have friends to hang out with for they have moved on and led good lives. I feel so alone and stuck. I want to do things and I'm so frustrated that I can't work or school.</p>
<p>After leaving highschool, I had decided to help my mother's family friends who were trying to adopt for 10 years and had no luck. In november of 2011, I had a baby son named Nathaniel for the couple and due to the pregnancy, my body has endured new problems.</p>
<p>I am so sick of living this life and I'm worried I will get worse after my insurance ends. </p>
<p>I am asking for donations to help with medicines and the hormone shots i will need for my illness along with future procedures i will need after losing insurance. I know not many may understand but I am still asking for help.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<div>The Calibrace works in a few ways; The front apron and stretch side panels provide circumferential stress in the torso reliving pain in the lower back.  Then, the patent pending tensioning system lifts the shoulders up and back, providing support to the spine.  The brace is also lightweight, breathable and discrete.  Thus, users can wear the brace under clothing.</div>
<div>
<h3>Testing and Testimonials </h3>

Our goal for these next 30 days is to manufacture the Calibrace: the world's first back braces designed for the movement impaired.  We are raising money for our first manufacturing run in Rocky Mount, Virginia. 
Get the Calibrace now and support our movement!


Introducing the AbiliLife, Maker of the Calibrace!
We are AbiliLife, a company dedicated to creating biomedical products to improve the quality of life for people with movement impairments.  
AbiliLife is raising money to fund the manufacturing of the Calibrace, a brace designed for the movement impaired.  We want to foster awareness and community for those with movement impairments, their caregivers, family and loved ones.  While the brace was designed for those with movement impairments, it can be used by anyone who has back pain or poor posture.
By supporting our campaign, you would be be helping us improve the quality of life for people with movement impairments. They will feel more supported and stable while wearing the brace.











How It Works
The Calibrace works in a few ways; The front apron and stretch side panels provide circumferential stress in the torso reliving pain in the lower back.  Then, the patent pending tensioning system lifts the shoulders up and back, providing support to the spine.  The brace is also lightweight, breathable and discrete.  Thus, users can wear the brace under clothing.

Testing and Testimonials 
We have conducted extensive in house biomechanical lab testing and have seen posture improve by as much as nine degrees.  


Users also reported feeling supported while wearing the brace. Our users love our product.  Check out some of our customers' feedback while wearing the brace:  
“I am more upright”
“I can see out”
“I feel supported” 
“It’s easier to walk”
""I don't want to take it off""
""Whoa-I feel it working""

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To feel and look good, body brushing is an essential part of the treatment. Brushing the body as part of the corporal cleaning routine will give you a soft skin and improve the corporal hygiene on having managed to penetrate more into the skin's pores.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A good brushing will allow you to remove dead skin cells and clear pores blocked by sweat, improving, in this way, our body's perspiration. For successful results, a dry brushing must be done before the shower because this will help to stimulate the skin and remove desquamations. Then, make a wet brushing during shower or bath.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The greatest benefits are obtained by brushing the body towards the heart, forming clockwise circles. This will activate blood circulation and stimulate the lymphatic system which is in charge of eliminating the waste responsible for the cellulite.</p>

The skin may redden and feel a tingling as the body brushing increases the circulation in areas of high concentration of fats. The applied pressure should depend on the skin and body toning. At first you should brush gently. The skin will tone up quickly and soon it will be possible to brush more vigorously and, if possible, with better results.</p>

Both accessories are used in combination, since the BodyBrush pumice is too hard for other body areas. Do not forget to exfoliate your hands, they need it the same or even more than the rest of the body.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Applying hot water while rubbing the area circularly, will help to remove debris and keeping your skin clean and smooth at all times. Alternating between hot and cold water will help to stimulate blood circulation to the skin. This gives a pleasant state of relaxation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The use of this accessory is not recommended for babies or damaged skins, with wounds or irritated. It is not recommended to exfoliate more than once a week.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Like the regular sponge, this sponge is open-pored, therefore the water passes completely preventing soap scum remaining inside and accelerating the drying process, thus improving the hygiene of the accessory.</p>

<h2 style=""font-family: impact; font-size: 20pt; text-align: justify; color: orange;"">Anti-cellulite accessories</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cellulite is a problem that affects 90% of women and 10% of men. It is formed when fat cells store fat, water and toxins, increasing the initial volume of the adipocyte giving the appearance of ""orange skin"" and preventing the blood from circulating correctly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This change stems from complications of the lymphatic circulation (responsible for transporting waste substances in our body), due to various factors that may be hormonal, congenital, alimentary, lifestyle or psychological.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">BodyBrush anti-cellulite accessories help to tone up, to mold, to get silky skin and to reduce the unsightly effects of ""orange skin"" and the problems of fluid retention. Together with hot and cold water alternated spurts, they stimulate blood circulation to provide the skin the necessary nutrients, while gliding it with pressure for the most affected areas to stimulate the lymph nodes and undo cellulite nodules, such that the fat accumulated in the surface is distributed uniformly to obtain a smooth skin.</p>

To combat cellulite it is also necessary to follow a series of recommendations as to follow a low-fat diet (without meats, fried food, sausages, etc) and rich in vegetables and fruit, drink plenty of water, raise the legs when resting and do the necessary exercise to burn the extra fats accumulated. This accessory helps to reduce the effects of cellulite but perseverance is needed to have good habits on a daily basis.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Los mayores beneficios se obtienen cepillando el cuerpo en sentido hacia el corazón, formando círculos en sentido horario. Esto activará la circulación sanguínea y estimulará el sistema linfático que es el que se encarga de eliminar los desechos responsables de la celulitis.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Existen diferentes durezas en las cerdas adaptadas a los diferentes tipos de piel. Las pieles sensibles deberán utilizar cerdas suaves y las pieles normales las cerdas de mayor dureza. La piel puede enrojecerse y sentirse un hormigueo a medida que el cepillado corporal aumenta la circulación en áreas de alta concentración de grasas. La presión ejercida deberá depender de la tonificación de piel y cuerpo. Al principio debe cepillarse suavemente. La piel se tonificará rápidamente y pronto se podrá cepillar más vigorosamente y con, si cabe, mejores resultados.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Debe prestarse especial atención a las áreas propensas a las durezas, como codos o rodillas, o a las arrugas, como pecho y cuello. Éste es también un buen momento para usar la piedra pómez BodyBrush en los pies, ya que la esponja exfoliante no resolverá el problema. Los dos accesorios se usan en combinación, ya que la piedra pómez BodyBrush es demasiado dura para otras áreas del cuerpo. No debe olvidarse exfoliar las manos, que lo necesitan tanto o más que el resto del cuerpo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Aplique agua caliente mientras frota la zona de forma circular, esto ayudará a eliminar los restos y a mantener una piel limpia y suave en todo momento. Alternar entre agua fría y caliente ayudará a estimular la circulación sanguínea hacia la piel. Con esto se consigue un agradable estado de relajación.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">El uso de este accesorio no es recomendable en bebés ni en pieles dañadas, con heridas o irritadas. No es recomendable realizar la exfoliación más de una vez a la semana.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Al igual que la esponja normal, esta esponja es de poros abiertos, por lo que deja pasar completamente el agua evitando que se queden restos de jabón en el interior y acelerando el proceso de secado, mejorando así la higiene del accesorio.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<h2 style=""font-family: impact; font-size: 20pt; text-align: justify; color: orange;"">Accesorios anticelulíticos</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">La celulitis es un problema que afecta al 90% de las mujeres y al 10% de los hombres. Se forma cuando los adipocitos acumulan grasa, agua y toxinas, aumentando el volumen inicial del adipocito dando ese aspecto de piel de ""naranja"" y evitando que la sangre circule correctamente.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Esta alteración tiene su origen en la complicación de la circulación linfática (encargada de transportar las sustancias de desecho de nuestro cuerpo), debido a diversos factores que pueden ser de tipo hormonal, congénito, alimentario, estilo de vida o psicológico.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Los accesorios anticelulíticos BodyBrush ayudan a tonificar, moldear, conseguir una piel sedosa y reducir los efectos antiestéticos de la piel de ""naranja"" así como los problemas de retención de líquidos. Junto a chorros alternados de agua fría y caliente se estimula la circulación sanguínea para aportar a la piel los nutrientes necesarios, al mismo tiempo, se desliza con presión el accesorio por aquellas zonas más afectadas para estimular los nodos linfáticos y deshacer los nódulos de celulitis, de tal manera que la grasa acumulada en la superficie se distribuya de forma uniforme para obtener una piel lisa.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Consejos: No es recomendable aplicar más de 15 minutos en cada zona. Para combatir la celulitis también es necesario seguir una serie de recomendaciones como seguir una dieta baja en grasas nocivas (carnes, fritos, embutidos, etc...) y rica en verduras y fruta, beber mucha agua, elevar las piernas cuando estemos en reposo y hacer el ejercicio necesario para quemar la grasas extra acumuladas. Este accesorio ayuda a disminuir los efectos de la celulitis pero es necesaria su constancia en tener unos hábitos saludables de forma diaria.</p>

BodyBrush
In BodyBrush we care about your personal well-being and, therefore, we have developed a wide range of products that will help to improve your quality of life.
Our shower head allows you to perform various body beauty treatments while taking a revitalizing shower.
In addition, our wide range of creams and oils perfectly complement the use of our other products.



 
BodyBrush Shower Head
BodyBrush is an innovative set of shower head and accessories (patent pending) for corporal health, designed specifically to recover the radiant splendour of healthy skin. With a daily massage and cleaning with BodyBrush you will recover the shine on the skin, tone up your body and reduce cellulite.
The skin brushing removes the old dead layer of the epidermis, sweat and other bodily waste products generated by human metabolism. Its long handle allows you to reach those hard to reach areas.
 


Accessories
Brush


To feel and look good, body brushing is an essential part of the treatment. Brushing the body as part of the corporal cleaning routine will give you a soft skin and improve the corporal hygiene on having managed to penetrate more into the skin's pores.
A good brushing will allow you to remove dead skin cells and clear pores blocked by sweat, improving, in this way, our body's perspiration. For successful results, a dry brushing must be done before the shower because this will help to stimulate the skin and remove desquamations. Then, make a wet brushing during shower or bath.
The greatest benefits are obtained by brushing the body towards the heart, forming clockwise circles. This will activate blood circulation and stimulate the lymphatic system which is in charge of eliminating the waste responsible for the cellulite.

 



There are different hardnesses in the bristles adapted to different types of skin. Sensitive skins should use soft bristles and normal skins harder bristles. The skin may redden and feel a tingling as the body brushing increases the circulation in areas of high concentration of fats. The applied pressure should depend on the skin and body toning. At first you should brush gently. The skin will tone up quickly and soon it will be possible to brush more vigorously and, if possible, with better results.
If more than one person in the family practice body brushing, each person must have his/her own brush.
 
Sponge


 
 
 
 

This sponge is an accessory that complements the daily hygiene of the shower, allowing greater depth in cleaning germs and bacteria off the skin. This accessory allows lathering and distributing BodyBrush gel or soap evenly throughout the body, while applying hot or cold water, depending on the user's desire.
Do not forget to use BodyBrush mild soap to avoid oily or dry skin. The most important thing when using the sponge is that once used, it


must be properly rinsed, removing product residues and letting it dry properly in a well ventilated area. The BodyBrush sponge has open pores, so that water passes completely preventing soap scum remaining inside and accelerating the drying process, thus improving the hygiene of the accessory.
 
Synthetic Pumice
The callus (thickening and hardening of the skin surface) in feet, heels, hands and elbows are one of the aesthetic problems that can be avoided with appropriate care.
The application of water will soften the skin and prepare it for rubbing, gently, the affected skin area with BodyBrush synthetic pumice. This synthetic pumice is made of cellular glass and, thanks to this composition, it does not absorb liquids and bacteria, fungi and microorganisms neither survive in its surface nor penetrate in its interior, avoiding possible infections.
Just like the brush, there are two types of synthetic pumice, depending on the pore size:




 
Exfoliating sponge



The accessory to exfoliate the skin will get the dead cells removed from the superficial layers of the dermis, thus preventing blocked pores, getting a clearer skin and preventing cellulite.
At the end of the shower, after having used BodyBrush soap or gel to wash the skin, the whole body is to be massaged with circular movements with this exfoliating sponge. Be careful not to rub too hard, as this may damage the skin. Pay particular attention to areas prone to callus, such as elbows or knees, or wrinkles, like chest and neck.

 



 



That would be also a good time to use BodyBrush pumice stone on your feet since the exfoliating sponge will not solve the problem. Both accessories are used in combination, since the BodyBrush pumice is too hard for other body areas. Do not forget to exfoliate your hands, they need it the same or even more than the rest of the body.
Applying hot water while rubbing the area circularly, will help to remove debris and keeping your skin clean and smooth at all times. Alternating between hot and cold water will help to stimulate blood circulation to the skin. This gives a pleasant state of relaxation.
The use of this accessory is not recommended for babies or damaged skins, with wounds or irritated. It is not recommended to exfoliate more than once a week.
Like the regular sponge, this sponge is open-pored, therefore the water passes completely preventing soap scum remaining inside and accelerating the drying process, thus improving the hygiene of the accessory.
 
Anti-cellulite accessories
Cellulite is a problem that affects 90% of women and 10% of men. It is formed when fat cells store fat, water and toxins, increasing the initial volume of the adipocyte giving the appearance of ""orange skin"" and preventing the blood from circulating correctly.
This change stems from complications of the lymphatic circulation (responsible for transporting waste substances in our body), due to various factors that may be hormonal, congenital, alimentary, lifestyle or psychological.
BodyBrush anti-cellulite accessories help to tone up, to mold, to get silky skin and to reduce the unsightly effects of ""orange skin"" and the problems of fluid retention. Together with hot and cold water alternated spurts, they stimulate blood circulation to provide the skin the necessary nutrients, while gliding it with pressure for the most affected areas to stimulate the lymph nodes and undo cellulite nodules, such that the fat accumulated in the surface is distributed uniformly to obtain a smooth skin.


 


Tips: It is not recommended to apply more than 15 minutes in each zone. To combat cellulite it is also necessary to follow a series of recommendations as to follow a low-fat diet (without meats, fried food, sausages, etc) and rich in vegetables and fruit, drink plenty of water, raise the legs when resting and do the necessary exercise to burn the extra fats accumulated. This accessory helps to reduce the effects of cellulite but perseverance is needed to have good habits on a daily basis.
 
Creams and oils
In collaboration with Bio Cositas buenas S.L., manufacturer of certified organic cosmetics, we've developped a line of products which will complement perfectly with our shower head and accessories.
Body milk


This is a very pleasant to apply body lotion which is quickly absorbed. It leaves skin hydrated with a pleasant feeling of softness and elasticity thanks to the combination of its ingredients. It penetrates easily and it's suitable for all skin types.

Sweet almond oil


It provides elasticity to the skin, leaving it soft, nourished and moisturized. It is widely used as the basis for massages, alone or with other essential oils, because of its emollient and anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to soften without blocking pores. It lubricates and protects, being very appropriate for allergies and irritation problems since it has soothing effects. It prevents and repairs stretch marks and wrinkles. It is ideal to apply it in very sensitive skins like baby skin.
With great nutritional and demulcents properties, it provides the skin with an intense moisturizing, even in those worst harmed skins.

It has the ability to tone and heal.

It also contains carrageenan, a gum which comes from the seaweed, rich in polysaccharides that helps to create a thin protective film.

 
 


Shea butter and rosehip


This mix takes in conjunction the properties of rosehip and shea butter. It regenerates the superficial layers of the skin and gives firmness and elasticity to it. It is recommended in the treatment of dry, aged, irritated or sensitive skins. It reduces stretch marks and prevent their appearance. It also protects from external aggressions, thus its use being recommended after solar exposure and physical activity. It can be also used as a hair mask.

Teleducha BodyBrush
BodyBrush es un innovador conjunto de teleducha y accesorios (patente en trámites) para la salud corporal, diseñado específicamente para recuperar el esplendor radiante de una piel sana. Con una limpieza con masaje diario de BodyBrush recuperará el brillo en la piel, tonificará su cuerpo y reducirá la celulitis.
El cepillado de la piel elimina la capa vieja y muerta de la epidermis, el sudor y otros productos de desecho corporal que genera el metabolismo humano. Su largo mango le permitirá llegar a aquellas zonas de difícil acceso.



Accesorios
Cepillo


Para sentirse bien y tener un buen aspecto, el cepillado del cuerpo es una parte indispensable del tratamiento. Cepillar el cuerpo como parte de la rutina de limpieza corporal, le permitirá obtener una piel suave y mejorar la higiene corporal al conseguir profundizar más en los poros de la piel.
Un buen cepillado nos permitirá eliminar células de piel muerta así como limpiar los poros obstruidos por el sudor, de esta manera mejoraremos la transpiración de nuestro cuerpo. Para mayor éxito en los resultados, debe realizarse un cepillado en seco previo a la ducha porque esto ayudará a estimular la piel y eliminar descamaciones. Entonces, realizar el cepillado en mojado durante la ducha o baño.

 



Los mayores beneficios se obtienen cepillando el cuerpo en sentido hacia el corazón, formando círculos en sentido horario. Esto activará la circulación sanguínea y estimulará el sistema linfático que es el que se encarga de eliminar los desechos responsables de la celulitis.
Existen diferentes durezas en las cerdas adaptadas a los diferentes tipos de piel. Las pieles sensibles deberán utilizar cerdas suaves y las pieles normales las cerdas de mayor dureza. La piel puede enrojecerse y sentirse un hormigueo a medida que el cepillado corporal aumenta la circulación en áreas de alta concentración de grasas. La presión ejercida deberá depender de la tonificación de piel y cuerpo. Al principio debe cepillarse suavemente. La piel se tonificará rápidamente y pronto se podrá cepillar más vigorosamente y con, si cabe, mejores resultados.
Si más de una persona en la familia practica el cepillado corporal, cada persona debe tener su propio cepillo.
 
Esponja


 
 
 
 

Esta esponja es un accesorio que complementa la higiene diaria de la ducha, permitiendo una mayor profundidad en la limpieza de gérmenes y bacterias en la piel. Este accesorio permite enjabonarse y repartir el jabón o gel BodyBrush de manera uniforme por todo el cuerpo, mientras se aplica agua caliente o fría, según el deseo del usuario.
No debe olvidarse usar el jabón neutro BodyBrush para evitar la piel grasa o seca.


Lo más importante del uso de la esponja es que una vez usada, hay que enjuagarla correctamente, quitándole restos de producto y dejarla secar adecuadamente en un área bien ventilada. A la esponja BodyBrush se le ha hecho un orificio en el centro para permitir que pase completamente el agua, evitando que se queden restos de jabón en el interior, mejorando así la higiene del accesorio.
 
Piedra Pómez Sintética
Las durezas (engrosamiento y endurecimiento de la parte superficial de la piel) en pies, talones, manos y codos son uno de los problemas estéticos que se pueden evitar con los cuidados oportunos.
La aplicación del agua reblandecerá la piel y la preparará para poder frotar, de forma suave, la zona de piel afectada con la piedra pómez sintética BodyBrush. Esta piedra pómez sintética está hecha de vidrio celular y, gracias a esta composición, no absorbe líquidos y las bacterias, hongos y microorganismos no sobreviven en su superficie ni penetran en su interior, evitando posibles infecciones.
Como con el cepillo, existen dos tipos de piedra pómez sintética, dependiendo del tamaño del poro:




 
Esponja exfoliante



El accesorio para exfoliar la piel logrará eliminar las células muertas de las capas superficiales de la dermis, de este modo se evitara que los poros se tapen, obteniendo una piel más limpia y previniendo la celulitis.
Al final de la ducha, después de haber usado jabón o gel BodyBrush para lavar la piel, se masajea el cuerpo entero con movimientos circulares con la esponja exfoliante BodyBrush. Hay que tener cuidado de no frotar demasiado fuerte, ya que se podría dañar la piel.

 



 



Debe prestarse especial atención a las áreas propensas a las durezas, como codos o rodillas, o a las arrugas, como pecho y cuello. Éste es también un buen momento para usar la piedra pómez BodyBrush en los pies, ya que la esponja exfoliante no resolverá el problema. Los dos accesorios se usan en combinación, ya que la piedra pómez BodyBrush es demasiado dura para otras áreas del cuerpo. No debe olvidarse exfoliar las manos, que lo necesitan tanto o más que el resto del cuerpo.
Aplique agua caliente mientras frota la zona de forma circular, esto ayudará a eliminar los restos y a mantener una piel limpia y suave en todo momento. Alternar entre agua fría y caliente ayudará a estimular la circulación sanguínea hacia la piel. Con esto se consigue un agradable estado de relajación.
El uso de este accesorio no es recomendable en bebés ni en pieles dañadas, con heridas o irritadas. No es recomendable realizar la exfoliación más de una vez a la semana.
Al igual que la esponja normal, esta esponja es de poros abiertos, por lo que deja pasar completamente el agua evitando que se queden restos de jabón en el interior y acelerando el proceso de secado, mejorando así la higiene del accesorio.
 
Accesorios anticelulíticos
La celulitis es un problema que afecta al 90% de las mujeres y al 10% de los hombres. Se forma cuando los adipocitos acumulan grasa, agua y toxinas, aumentando el volumen inicial del adipocito dando ese aspecto de piel de ""naranja"" y evitando que la sangre circule correctamente.
Esta alteración tiene su origen en la complicación de la circulación linfática (encargada de transportar las sustancias de desecho de nuestro cuerpo), debido a diversos factores que pueden ser de tipo hormonal, congénito, alimentario, estilo de vida o psicológico.
Los accesorios anticelulíticos BodyBrush ayudan a tonificar, moldear, conseguir una piel sedosa y reducir los efectos antiestéticos de la piel de ""naranja"" así como los problemas de retención de líquidos. Junto a chorros alternados de agua fría y caliente se estimula la circulación sanguínea para aportar a la piel los nutrientes necesarios, al mismo tiempo, se desliza con presión el accesorio por aquellas zonas más afectadas para estimular los nodos linfáticos y deshacer los nódulos de celulitis, de tal manera que la grasa acumulada en la superficie se distribuya de forma uniforme para obtener una piel lisa.


 


Consejos: No es recomendable aplicar más de 15 minutos en cada zona. Para combatir la celulitis también es necesario seguir una serie de recomendaciones como seguir una dieta baja en grasas nocivas (carnes, fritos, embutidos, etc...) y rica en verduras y fruta, beber mucha agua, elevar las piernas cuando estemos en reposo y hacer el ejercicio necesario para quemar la grasas extra acumuladas. Este accesorio ayuda a disminuir los efectos de la celulitis pero es necesaria su constancia en tener unos hábitos saludables de forma diaria.

<p><strong><em>THE APPEAL</em></strong></p>
<p>We are seeking your financial support to help with medical expenses for Keisha Powell.   Keisha was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder called Myasthenia Gravis.  Myasthenia affects the muscles and the nerves that control them – resulting in weakness in the muscles.  Keisha is currently in the ICU at Kingston Public Hospital (KPH) in Kingston, Jamaica.   She has been on the respirator since May 16, 2012, as she is unable to maintain her respiration because of weakness of her chest wall muscles. </p>
<p><strong><em>HER STORY</em></strong></p>
<p>This is Keisha’s story….She is 34 years old and the mother of two young girls.  She works in the AE/X-Ray department as a Radiology Technician at KPH.  About two years ago, she started having random symptoms. She had tingling in her fingers...she dismissed this as due to the stress of school, raising the girls and everything else going on in her life.   The tingling led to numbness and sometimes a complete loss of feelings in her hand…sometimes she dropped objects.   Numerous trips to the doctor yielded no diagnosis.  She was tired all the time …Still no diagnosis.  Over time other symptoms appeared, double-vision in one eye - but the symptoms were not consistent…they came…they went. </p>
<p>By mid-2011 another more troubling symptom appeared.  She started having trouble swallowing….it was great for weight-loss because she stopped eating but it was particularly troubling…still no diagnosis.  Her voice changed.  People started to tell her that her voice sounded nasal.  The tiredness, however, stayed with her.  So she went back to her doctor and insisted that something was wrong and something needed to be done.   This doctor referred her to a neurologist, who finally put it all together and tested her for Myasthenia Gravis.  The diagnosis came in February 2012 and she felt “finally …a diagnosis…I can be treated and even if I have to make adjustments I can get on with my girls and life”. </p>
<p>Keisha started having trouble breathing. It became increasingly difficult for her to work or care for her girls. She was in and out of emergency rooms three times in three weeks until finally she was admitted to the ICU and put on the respirator. Several treatments have been tried but so far none has been successful in helping Keisha.  She now needs a procedure called Plasmapheresis, which is a process in which antibodies are removed from the bloodstream. This procedure is not available in Jamaica. The resources to treat Keisha are not availabe in Jamaica. </p>
<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>The medical bills have taken a toll on Keisha and her family - hence the need for financial assistance.  Financial donations may be made towards Keisha's growing medical bills and also to get her stabilized care in the United States. It is our prayer that she will get well enough to care for her two young daughters.</p>
<p>Because of the rare nature of this disease in the Caribbean, Keisha's doctor  has recommended she be flown to a hospital in the United States for the care she badly needs. The family is also seeking medical professionals with MG experience to sponsor or assist in finding the right healthcare channels. They have exhausted their resources and cannot do this alone. </p>

</h2>
<p>I sell a vest full of ice that's designed to burn calories. It is <i>Patent Pending </i>at the United States Patent Office, backed by decades of independent scientific research, has undergone preliminary scientific testing with multiple users, and is <b>currently</b> undergoing <b><i>two</i> </b>large-scale clinical trials.</p>
<p>I'm a NASA scientist and a professor. What you're about to read is going to sound like science fiction, but it's not. Scientists have spent <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">decades </i>studying how mild cold exposure can enhance calorie burn. Quietly, and without fuss, the evidence for cold exposure induced calorie burn has been accumulating. It's time to bring the science to the public. That's what I'm here to do: to explain to you what is probably the most novel, evidence-based calorie-burning idea that's come out of the scientific community in many years, and to tell you how you can take advantage of it without pain, without discomfort, and without taking more than 2 minutes of time out of your busy day.</p>
<p>Let's be blunt: <b>there is no magic pill for weight loss</b>, and <i>The Cold Shoulder</i> is no exception to that rule. The cold, hard truth is that <b>the foundation of weight control is your diet</b>. In order to maintain a healthy weight, do what grandma told you: eat your veggies, cut the fat off your steak, and avoid junk food, especially sweets. If you continue to eat junk, then no amount of exercise, cold exposure, or weirdly named supplements or powders will help you lose weight. The vest can burn up to a pound of fat per week if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating too much junk food. So don't expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight. You can't.</p>
<p>But if you are already eating well and getting moderate exercise and want to <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">accelerate </i>your calorie-burning efforts by burning excess calories while at rest, there's no simpler, easier, or more time-efficient way than wearing our vest.</p>
<p>We'd like to emphasize exactly under what conditions <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">The Cold Shoulder</i> can induce the burning of excess calories. Basically, you need to be in an environment where you are otherwise at a comfortable temperature, and you are <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">not</i> exercising. If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature, then wearing <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">The Cold Shoulder</i> directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm.</p>
<p>If you are in a hot environment, the <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">The Cold Shoulder</i> will help you stay cool, but it won't burn excess calories, because you're not cold. If you are working out in the gym, then <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">The Cold Shoulder</i> can help you stay cool, but will not enhance your calorie burn, because you're not cold in that environment. If the vest is not cold, or if the ice has all melted, it will not induce excess calorie burn. Remember that the goal of <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">The Cold Shoulder</i> is to force you to burn calories at a time when you otherwise would not: sitting down, at rest, in a comfortable environment at room temperature.</p>
<p>So, to burn excess calories, wear <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">The Cold Shoulder </i>sitting on the couch watching the game, or in front of your computer, or in your car during your commute. Any time you'd normally just be sitting around comfortable---that's the time to don <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">The Cold Shoulder</i> and enhance your calorie burn.</p>
<p>Whether you're an athlete, an actor/model, or a couch potato, almost everybody today could benefit from burning a few more calories without expending time or effort. <b style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: inherit;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: bold;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">Note that <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">The Cold Shoulder </i>cannot claim to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, illness or condition. </b>All we can claim is that if it's worn as directed, then it's guaranteed to burn excess calories --<i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">that </i>part is scientific fact.</p>

<p>The first thing I always hear when I say I’m touting a “cold vest” is, “I don’t like being cold.” But think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over‐stimulation? How about wearing a corset just to <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">appear </i>thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro‐intestinal surgery? Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison. <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">The Cold Shoulder </i>has no known side effects. Users who start skeptical end up wearing it routinely, and even find they look forward to putting it on at the end of a long day.</p>
<p>There is an aspect of the calorie equation that has been largely neglected for too long. There is a huge hole in our collective knowledge. Although exercise is definitely good, most people think that exercise is the<i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">only</i>way to burn excess calories.<b style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: inherit;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: bold;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;""><i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;""> But it's not.</i></b></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 22px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 1.2em;background-color: initial;"">The Solution - Burn excess calories using mild cold exposure</span><br/></p>
<p>In addition to exercise, there’s another, much less well-known but scientifically well-established way to burn calories. It’s called <b style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: inherit;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: bold;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;""><i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">mild cold exposure</i></b>. Basically, if you extract heat from your body, even if you’re sitting on your couch in front of the T.V., your body will need to burn calories to stay warm. This is a scientific fact – and I should know, since I work at NASA with a group of scientists that study ice. The trick is to figure out how to harness mild cold exposure without being uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The idea of using mild cold exposure to burn calories has slowly started to percolate into the popular media. Articles on the subject have appeared in many places, including the venues mentioned at the top of this page. The problem is that they often recommend painful or impractical methods of cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths. Very few people have the courage to try that.</p>
<p>I was studying the science of how cold exposure burns calories, when I had a light-bulb moment. I thought, ""If cold exposure burns calories, there’s got to be a way I can harness its power to help ordinary people increase their calorie burn."" That’s when I began the work that eventually led me to develop <i style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: italic;font-variant: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-size: 14px;vertical-align: baseline;"">The Cold Shoulder</i>. It's a vest that drapes ice over the shoulder and back, and extracts calories while you wear it. The vest looks like this:</p>

<p>Here's what Rob had to say after a 2-week trial of <i>The Cold Shoulder</i>:</p>
<p><i>""My body fat levels have remained stable for
about 6 months at around 9% plus minus 0.2%. After 2 weeks wearing The Cold Shoulder it was clear that my body fat percentage reduced by another 0.5%. This does not
seem like much, bu given that I started with so little body fat, it is a
<b>loss of approximately 5.5% of my total fat in two weeks,</b> which is a significant change in just two weeks.  A loss like this for effectively doing
nothing is excellent.  Furthermore my body
fat percentage has reached a new low than ever previously – and I believe my
trial clearly shows that it was a result of The Cold Shoulder.</i></p>
<p><i>Back to what I mentioned earlier about my
weight remaining unchanged – my best conclusion is that whatever weight was
lost in fat, I have gained approximately in muscle. I have no proof or statics
of this but it makes sense and also agrees with the cold exposure studies.</i></p>
<p><i>The Cold Shoulder is a high quality product
that I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting that extra edge in toning
up and reducing body fat percentage. It is comfortable and easy to use, and has
definitely produced results for me with effectively zero effort!""</i></p>

Weight loss via mild cold exposure has been featured in

  


Our Story

I sell a vest full of ice that's designed to burn calories. It is Patent Pending at the United States Patent Office, backed by decades of independent scientific research, has undergone preliminary scientific testing with multiple users, and is currently undergoing two large-scale clinical trials.
I'm a NASA scientist and a professor. What you're about to read is going to sound like science fiction, but it's not. Scientists have spent decades studying how mild cold exposure can enhance calorie burn. Quietly, and without fuss, the evidence for cold exposure induced calorie burn has been accumulating. It's time to bring the science to the public. That's what I'm here to do: to explain to you what is probably the most novel, evidence-based calorie-burning idea that's come out of the scientific community in many years, and to tell you how you can take advantage of it without pain, without discomfort, and without taking more than 2 minutes of time out of your busy day.
Let's be blunt: there is no magic pill for weight loss, and The Cold Shoulder is no exception to that rule. The cold, hard truth is that the foundation of weight control is your diet. In order to maintain a healthy weight, do what grandma told you: eat your veggies, cut the fat off your steak, and avoid junk food, especially sweets. If you continue to eat junk, then no amount of exercise, cold exposure, or weirdly named supplements or powders will help you lose weight. The vest can burn up to a pound of fat per week if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating too much junk food. So don't expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight. You can't.
But if you are already eating well and getting moderate exercise and want to accelerate your calorie-burning efforts by burning excess calories while at rest, there's no simpler, easier, or more time-efficient way than wearing our vest.
We'd like to emphasize exactly under what conditions The Cold Shoulder can induce the burning of excess calories. Basically, you need to be in an environment where you are otherwise at a comfortable temperature, and you are not exercising. If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature, then wearing The Cold Shoulder directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm.
If you are in a hot environment, the The Cold Shoulder will help you stay cool, but it won't burn excess calories, because you're not cold. If you are working out in the gym, then The Cold Shoulder can help you stay cool, but will not enhance your calorie burn, because you're not cold in that environment. If the vest is not cold, or if the ice has all melted, it will not induce excess calorie burn. Remember that the goal of The Cold Shoulder is to force you to burn calories at a time when you otherwise would not: sitting down, at rest, in a comfortable environment at room temperature.
So, to burn excess calories, wear The Cold Shoulder sitting on the couch watching the game, or in front of your computer, or in your car during your commute. Any time you'd normally just be sitting around comfortable---that's the time to don The Cold Shoulder and enhance your calorie burn.
Whether you're an athlete, an actor/model, or a couch potato, almost everybody today could benefit from burning a few more calories without expending time or effort. Note that The Cold Shoulder cannot claim to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, illness or condition. All we can claim is that if it's worn as directed, then it's guaranteed to burn excess calories --that part is scientific fact.

The Problem: Exercise is not the only way to burn calories
The first thing I always hear when I say I’m touting a “cold vest” is, “I don’t like being cold.” But think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over‐stimulation? How about wearing a corset just to appear thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro‐intestinal surgery? Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison. The Cold Shoulder has no known side effects. Users who start skeptical end up wearing it routinely, and even find they look forward to putting it on at the end of a long day.
There is an aspect of the calorie equation that has been largely neglected for too long. There is a huge hole in our collective knowledge. Although exercise is definitely good, most people think that exercise is theonlyway to burn excess calories. But it's not.

The Solution - Burn excess calories using mild cold exposure
In addition to exercise, there’s another, much less well-known but scientifically well-established way to burn calories. It’s called mild cold exposure. Basically, if you extract heat from your body, even if you’re sitting on your couch in front of the T.V., your body will need to burn calories to stay warm. This is a scientific fact – and I should know, since I work at NASA with a group of scientists that study ice. The trick is to figure out how to harness mild cold exposure without being uncomfortable.
The idea of using mild cold exposure to burn calories has slowly started to percolate into the popular media. Articles on the subject have appeared in many places, including the venues mentioned at the top of this page. The problem is that they often recommend painful or impractical methods of cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths. Very few people have the courage to try that.
I was studying the science of how cold exposure burns calories, when I had a light-bulb moment. I thought, ""If cold exposure burns calories, there’s got to be a way I can harness its power to help ordinary people increase their calorie burn."" That’s when I began the work that eventually led me to develop The Cold Shoulder. It's a vest that drapes ice over the shoulder and back, and extracts calories while you wear it. The vest looks like this:


The Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest

I have put it to the scientific test and proved this vest's efficacy in controlled clinical trials. Here are a few before-and-after shots after just 3 weeks of using The Cold Shoulder:



Anthony Peters (above) accelerated his tummy loss using The Cold Shoulder





Results of 3 weeks of wearing The Cold Shoulder

Considering all the crazy things that people do to burn excess fat, from starvation diets to liposuction, a vest that burns calories while you continue about your day seems pretty tame, don't you think?

Why You’ll Love The Cold Shoulder
1. Burns calories without exercise.Whether you’re a gym rat or a couch potato, our ice vest will burn excess calories for you – the equivalent of up to 500 calories a day. This can more than double the calorie deficit you'd get from dieting alone.
2. Saves time. It takes about 30s to get the vest out of the freezer and put it on. Then you go about your day until the ice melts, and it's another thirty seconds to take it off and put it back into the freezer. Do that twice a day for a week, and you've spent 2 minutes per day to burn a pound of fat. Compare that to the same calories burned in a week of gym workouts, which can consume several hours per day once you include travel time, change room time, and waiting for the machines that are busy when you want to use them. Two minutes vs. two hours, for the same pound of fat.
3. It’s effective.The idea is based on decades of research by scientists from Harvard to Cambridge and beyond. Mild cold exposure burns calories – it’s a scientific fact. The only question is how to do it comfortably, effortlessly.... even fashionably!
4. It’s comfortable. The first time you wear it, yes, it'll feel cold. But you won’t shiver. After trying it a few times, you’ll hardly notice you’re wearing it. Some of our current users actually look forward to putting it on.
5. It gets more effective the more you use it.As your body acclimatizes to periodic mild cold exposure, it gets more used to the idea of turning on your internal furnace to burn calories. It gets easier and easier to burn off more and more calories, just like going to the gym gets easier the more you do it. This is exactly opposite to drugs or supplements, which usually decrease in effectiveness as your body builds a tolerance to them.
6.It’s fashionable. You can wear it pretty much anywhere. I've worn it to fancy French restaurants, as part of a 3-piece suit. I even tried wearing it on my wedding day, but my fiancé – now wife – decided it wasn’t quite ready for that.
7.Sold direct at wholesale prices. Expect to pay significantly more once this is available in retail stores. There’s no middle man. We’ll manufacture your vest and ship it directly to you.


How Does It Work?

The Science Behind Cold-exposure Based Calorie Burn
You don't need to be a scientist to understand that too much cold exposure – such as, say, floating in the North Atlantic after the Titanic sank – can extract so many calories so quickly that it can kill you. On the other hand, mild cold exposure is perfectly healthy, and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories.
For example, Olympic swimmers burn many more calories per day than other Olympic athletes, and it has nothing to do with the exercise.It’s the water.They spend their day in water that’s 20 degrees (F) below their body temperature, and this temperature difference makes them burn way more calories than the exercise alone.

Due to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone.

Any mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories, whether it’s a cold day outside, air conditioning set too high, or your skin being in contact with a cold object.  Scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades, and it’s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn.
Our vest, The Cold Shoulder, has ice draped over the shoulder and across the back:

Due to the temperature difference between the body and the ice vest, heat flows from the body to the vest, causing your body to burn calories.

These are the most comfortable places to put the ice because that's where your body has the fewest nerve endings. It's also the most scientifically valid place to put the ice because, just under the skin of the shoulders and back, there's a type of tissue called Brown Adipose Tissue(BAT). BAT burns calories when you encounter mild cold. Our clinical trials show that wearing our vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to a pound of fat per week more than you'd burn without it.

Example preliminary trial results
1) Nick Hamilton



Below is a graph of the body fat of Nick Hamilton over a 16-week period. Nick was one of our early testers of The Cold Shoulder. He was on a 16 week, tightly controlled diet and exercise regimen. The only change Nick made in the last 2 weeks was to start using The Cold Shoulder ice vest. You can see how much it accelerated his fat loss.

Nick Hamilton greatly accelerated his fat loss just by wearing The Cold Shoulder for an hour each morning and evening, for the last 2 weeks of his 16-week diet + exercise regimen.


2) Robert Camille

Here's what Rob had to say after a 2-week trial of The Cold Shoulder:
""My body fat levels have remained stable for
about 6 months at around 9% plus minus 0.2%. After 2 weeks wearing The Cold Shoulder it was clear that my body fat percentage reduced by another 0.5%. This does not
seem like much, bu given that I started with so little body fat, it is a
loss of approximately 5.5% of my total fat in two weeks, which is a significant change in just two weeks.  A loss like this for effectively doing
nothing is excellent.  Furthermore my body
fat percentage has reached a new low than ever previously – and I believe my
trial clearly shows that it was a result of The Cold Shoulder.
Back to what I mentioned earlier about my
weight remaining unchanged – my best conclusion is that whatever weight was
lost in fat, I have gained approximately in muscle. I have no proof or statics
of this but it makes sense and also agrees with the cold exposure studies.
The Cold Shoulder is a high quality product
that I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting that extra edge in toning
up and reducing body fat percentage. It is comfortable and easy to use, and has
definitely produced results for me with effectively zero effort!""

3) Kyle Timblin




Kyle did a different kind of test.  He was just heading into the Holidays when he started using The Cold Shoulder, and rather than trying to lose fat, his goal was to avoiding gaining fat over the Holidays.  Here's his experience:
""Thanks to The Cold Shoulder, I was able to eat 6,000 more calories over two weeks over the Holidays, without any weight gain. It is great to be able to indulge a bit without losing precious progress.""

4) Mike Smith


""I lost 1.5 pounds in 2 weeks wearing The Cold Shoulder.  In addition to that, my second favorite benefit was that my sleep improved. I wore it for just a few minutes before bed each night and slept much more soundly than I had done for months.""

(Note that Mike's weight loss was a bit less than other users --- less than the quoted pound per week --- because he didn't wear it for the full recommended 60-90 minutes in the evening.)

Evidence from independent scientists
For more info on cold exposure and calorie burn, see this page. Note that some of it is rather technical---definitely not light reading. But if you want some of the cold, hard scientific facts from independent researchers, this is the place to start. Most of the research was done even before I conceived of The Cold Shoulder, so you know it's independent and objective.


Our Mission

We want to bring the most functional, comfortable, honest, and stylish clothing-based calorie-burning aid to the global market. We want to spread the word that burning calories doesn’t have to require time-consuming gym visits, sweaty exercise, crazy calorie-restricted diet fads, or taking untested, questionable supplements with unknown side effects. Instead, we advocate that a healthy lifestyle must contain not only a healthy diet and moderate exercise, but also a regular dose of mild cold exposure.

Our Book
One of our perks is an electronic copy of our new book, The Cold War on Fat. It contains tons of science about cold exposure-based weight loss, as well as tons of other scientifically-based information about weight loss.





Will The Cold Shoulder Fat Burning Vest fit me?
We have sizes to fit everybody from XS to XXX-L. We’ll get your sizing option after the funding period is over.

He struggles with his short term memories, he can‘t read &amp; write and is not allowed to drive anymore. My family and our doctor decided NOT to tell him about the tumour. He is still trying really hard to learn to read/write again but it‘s not getting any better. We didn‘t tell him because our doctor said that people are more likely to lose their will to live &amp; learn after being informed that they have an incurable brain tumor<br/><br/>He keeps telling me how great it would be to spend some time on a proper farm in the United States, including feeding animals, cleaning barns etc. .. He cannot remember much about his past but what he remembers (in such detail) are all the memories that are linked to his life as a farmer before he retired (he sold the farm 10 years ago). For example, he still knows the brand name of his tractors, important dates such as harvest times/ deadlines for deliveries and how much time he would need to plough the land. It‘s nice listen to him when he talks about such things, because he does that always with a smile on his face. <br/><br/>So my idea is, to send my dad and mum for a few months to a proper US farm with lots of animals, land and machines. I found some nice places in the South where they offer accommodations on a farm where the visitors are also involved in the daily work. I am sure that my dad would be very happy if we send him over and the linguistics therapist we had also likes the idea because it would stimulate his memory training, makes him feel like home etc. ... <br/><br/>I would very much appreciate your support, thanks so much in advance for your donation and lets bring the old man back on a farm! <br/></p></div>","Honestly, I have never asked anyone for money before and I don‘t feel comfortable about it, but to get my dad‘s dream come true, I am willing to do so and am hereby asking you kindly for your help and support.

This is not my Eagle Scout project; I already completed it.  I am doing this project just to benefit the camp.  I am coordinating a project to build a new Gaga Ball Pit at Camp Sequassen in New Hartford, CT. This camp is owned by Connecticut Yankee Council in Milford, CT.  It is a non-profit organization.<br/></p>
<p>The current Gaga Ball Pit was funded by a donation and build by Scouts. At summer camp, the pit is constantly in use. There is need for a second pit.  <br/></p>
<h3><b>What is Gaga Ball?</b></h3>
<p>According to Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga-ga"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga-ga</a>), Ga-ga is Hebrew for touch-touch. It is a form of dodge ball played in an enclosed area with one ball. It combines dodging, striking, 
running and jumping. The object is to hit opponents below the knee before getting hit yourself. It is a fun, fast-paced game that gives boys great exercise.</p>
<h3>What will the Money be used for?</h3>
<p>The money will be used to purchase the hardware kit, pressure-treated lumber, base gravel, and rubberized surface. Here is the website of the company I plan to purchase the kit from: <a href=""http://www.gagaballpits.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.gagaballpits.com/</a>     It is very durable and professional-looking.<br/></p>
<p>Any additional money raised will be given to the camp for other projects.  <br/></p>
<p>Construction will be supervised by the camp ranger, and will be done completely by volunteer scouts.</p>
<h3>How much of Your Donation Goes to the Project?</h3>
<p>If I meet my goal, then 96% will go directly to the project.  Indiegogo takes 4%. Because it is a non-profit, I expect the fees to be less than four percent.  Some credit cards and PayPal charge a fee around 3-5%.<br/></p>
</div><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I understand some people can't contribute, but you can help me by spreading the word. <br/></p>

Sage Anxiety Treatment Program opened in 2011 and has enjoyed continuous growth.  More importantly, we've experienced the joy that comes with helping people regain their lives and do the things that bring vitality and value. Our program is a leader in being the first Intensive Program in the nation to integrate two evidence-based therapies - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Exposure and Response Prevention. 

People suffering from moderate to severe Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder or other anxiety-related disorders such as social anxiety or hair pulling spend between 9 and 15 hours per week in our program.  Imagine the depth of suffering that would lead to such a commitment.
Sage accepts insurance and it's become apparent over the past year that insurance providers are authorizing fewer and fewer sessions.  Clients who need continued treatment in order to lead a functional life are being denied authorizations.  It absolutely makes our hearts ache.
We have always provided pro bono for at least one client at any one time.  It has taken the form of either providing a full course of treatment at no charge or allowing a current client to continue in the program at no charge after their insurance has stopped authorizing sessions. Very few people can afford to continue out of pocket. Our mission is to help people, not to become wealthy.  
Unfortunately, insurance companies requirements have resulted in a large increase in overhead without an increase in reimbursement to us.  The result has been the cessation of pro bono services.  

What We Need & What You Get
 

We are looking for contributors to sponsor continued treatment once insurance has denied further care.  Often, we know that even 10 more 3-hour sessions could make the difference between being more functional but always plagued by OCD and being vital and fully functioning.
You may contribute at any amount.  It certainly doesn't have to be $375, but as a benchmark, one 3-hour session could be covered by $375.
Your contribution will have a direct and profound effect on a person's life and the lives of their loved ones.  OCD is a biologically based disorder and is almost always chronic with functioning deteriorating over time.  
Donations of less than $375 will be combined to provide one session.  Any amount is appreciated.

The Impact
 Our program is unique.  The traditional ""exposure"" treatment for OCD is helpful, but 20% of the people who hear about it decline treatment and 30% of the people who begin treatment drop out early.  At Sage, we have a 7.7% early drop out rate.

<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">Vibease is the world's first wearable smart vibrator. Over the past two years, Vibease has been working extensively to develop a vibrator that can create a truly immersive sexual experience, to incite all your senses.</p>
<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">We designed our product with female sexuality wellness in mind. After speaking to women and intimacy experts, we understand that physical stimulation alone is not enough. Many vibrators out there are just focusing on the vibration strength.</p>
<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">People often forget that the brain is the biggest sex organ. Research shows hearing, mood, emotion and fantasies play a big part in a woman's sexual pleasure and satisfaction. We've created a product using revolutionary technology to tap into how women are designed to best experience pleasure. The result is nothing short of extraordinary.</p>

<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">Fifty Shades of Grey sold millions of copies all over the world because it stimulated the mind. Now imagine listening to Fifty Shades of Grey with a hands free vibrator that works in perfect sync with the audio fantasy. The experience will have your toes curling. Vibease brings your fantasy to life, creating a multi-sensory experience. Your pleasure doesn't need to be solely imaginative anymore. It truly is an exciting new experience, full of anticipation. It's not about the end result. It's about the journey. The Vibease lets you enjoy every second of the journey all the way up until the exciting intense ""conclusion"".</p>

<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">By combining a Bluetooth-enabled vibrator with iOS and Android apps, Vibease vibrator vibrates in sync with audio fantasy.</p>
<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">With the Fantasy App, you can select one of the audio fantasies from the list to set you in the mood. You don't have to hold the vibrator (or your smartphone). You can relax and totally enjoy the moment. No user control is needed from this point onward. You are free to completely immerse into the fantasy and experience pleasure at a level you never thought possible.<br/><img alt=""Immersive vibrator experience"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/966449/pictures/full/20130803105216-immersive-vibrator.jpg?1375552339"" src="""" style="""" title=""Immersive vibrator experience""/></p>
<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">The Vibease and Fantasy app work like this: When the voice in the fantasy app says: ""I'm touching you softly"", the vibrator vibrates softly. And when the voice says: ""I'm touching you hard"", the vibrator vibrates hard. The vibrator reacts to the story within the Fantasy. The vibrations are personalized to each Fantasy, and it gives vibrations with different intensities and various patterns at just the right moments.</p>
<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">It's like the perfect partner that knows how to touch you at the right moment in the right way.</p>
<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">In the future we will also use binaural audio (3D audio) to make it even more real. Binaural audio gives sensation for the listener of actually being in the room with the performers. You can feel as if the person is beside you.</p>

<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">Fantasies are natural and positive elements of a woman's sexuality. Women who fantasize show higher rates of satisfaction. Women's fantasies tend to be less graphic and more emotional and intimate than men's. That's why we created a library of audio stories that will usher you away into an exciting world of fantasy. We provide a comprehensive library for you to find a fantasy that suits your mood. Each Fantasy contains audio and non-explicit images. It does not contain any video.</p>

<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">If you can't find any fantasies that suit your mood. The Fantasy App allows you to record your partner's voice and insert the varying levels of vibration to coincide with the audio content. The vibrations are fully customizable. Once you finish recording, you can replay it whenever you want to. Creating your own customized fantasies with your partner is fun, exciting and will surely add to the physical and emotional richness of your relationship.</p>
<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">You can even upload your own personal fantasy to the Fantasy Library and let other people listen to your fantasy.</p>

<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">We carefully designed the Vibease Smart Vibrator with modern women in mind. We wanted to make something both discreet and beautiful. The Vibease Smart Vibrator is designed for clitoral stimulation. Statistics indicate that 80 percent of women require clitoral stimulation to attain orgasm.</p>
<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">Vibease vibrator is small, measuring only 3.1 inches long. Good things really do come in small packages :) It is made from 100% body-safe silicone for a soft and comfortable feeling. Other features of the Vibease Smart Vibrator include:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">Compatible with most Android phones and latest iPhones.</li>
<li style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">
<strong><span style=""color: #d41269;"">Strong vibrations</span></strong> with customizable pulsations to provide as realistic an experience as possible.</li>

<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">Making the vibrator small, discreet and wearable is the one of the top requests we received from women for numerous reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">Mandatory for complete immersive experience. You can relax and enjoy your moment.</li>
<li style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">A total hands-free experience and your fingers will not get tired.</li>
<li style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">Discreet. No one will know that you're having a good time.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">We spent much time designing a comfortable, wearable vibrator. We wanted to create something easy to use, allowing women to slip it inside the undergarment whenever they wanted. After many different designs we found the solution by redesigning the tip. The tip is specially designed to make it easy for women to locate the sweet spot while ensuring the vibrator remains steadily in place. We do not recommend wearing the Vibease vibrator during outdoor activities.<img alt=""iPhone Vibease"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/953527/pictures/full/20130728121554-iphone-vibrator.jpg?1375038959"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">There are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product on a large scale. Mass manufacturing isn't the same as prototype development. Not all electronics manufacturers created equal. Every manufacturer has their own expertise, because every product has its own manufacturing challenges. The quality of our product was of paramount concern. We will not deliver a mediocre product. The devil is in the details, which is why selecting the right manufacturing partner was a top priority.</p>

<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">Successful business organizations surround themselves with experts. After vetting several candidates, we partnered with one of the biggest sex toy manufacturers in China to ensure the Vibease would meet our high manufacturing standards in terms of safety, quality and reliability. We've been working with our manufacturing partners for the past few months, perfecting the product to make it ready for mass production. They have manufactured high-quality vibrators for some of the most famous sex toy brands in the US and Europe. By working with experienced sex toy manufacturers, we have reduced the hardware-related challenges significantly, and avoided costly mistakes.</p>
<p style=""font-family: verdana; font-size: 14px;"">However, there is always the risk of unexpected circumstances delaying our delivery. We assure you that we will work hard to mitigate those risks. We plan to be 100% transparent throughout the delivery process.</p>

Vibease®: The world's first wearable smart vibrator brings your fantasies to life

Vibease is the world's first wearable smart vibrator. Over the past two years, Vibease has been working extensively to develop a vibrator that can create a truly immersive sexual experience, to incite all your senses.
We designed our product with female sexuality wellness in mind. After speaking to women and intimacy experts, we understand that physical stimulation alone is not enough. Many vibrators out there are just focusing on the vibration strength.
People often forget that the brain is the biggest sex organ. Research shows hearing, mood, emotion and fantasies play a big part in a woman's sexual pleasure and satisfaction. We've created a product using revolutionary technology to tap into how women are designed to best experience pleasure. The result is nothing short of extraordinary.

 
We're on the NEWS:  
What women say about Vibease
The wearable vibrator + fantasies combo you've always wanted! Cindy Gallop, founder of MakeLoveNotPorn
I am so excited and can’t wait to try this product out! We as women have been waiting for something revolutionary to be created that would allow for such amazing pleasure, alone or with a lover and your product looks exactly like what we’ve been waiting for!Jamie L
We love to see a company taking a woman's pleasure seriously. It's a passionate team championing smart and thoughtful design and we couldn't be happier to see them do well.We can't wait to try out the Vibease and Fantasy app this fall and clearly, we're in good company now.Unboundbox, an intimate revolution
The fact that women notoriously get turned on by reading should be a connection people made a long time ago, but perhaps it also has to do with the avoidance of women's sexuality? Regardless, I think it's awesome you are all following through and making your vision and advancements in technology become a reality.D L

The Vibease Vibrator: Excitement + Anticipation
Fifty Shades of Grey sold millions of copies all over the world because it stimulated the mind. Now imagine listening to Fifty Shades of Grey with a hands free vibrator that works in perfect sync with the audio fantasy. The experience will have your toes curling. Vibease brings your fantasy to life, creating a multi-sensory experience. Your pleasure doesn't need to be solely imaginative anymore. It truly is an exciting new experience, full of anticipation. It's not about the end result. It's about the journey. The Vibease lets you enjoy every second of the journey all the way up until the exciting intense ""conclusion"".
 
The Vibease: Immersive pleasure experience
By combining a Bluetooth-enabled vibrator with iOS and Android apps, Vibease vibrator vibrates in sync with audio fantasy.
With the Fantasy App, you can select one of the audio fantasies from the list to set you in the mood. You don't have to hold the vibrator (or your smartphone). You can relax and totally enjoy the moment. No user control is needed from this point onward. You are free to completely immerse into the fantasy and experience pleasure at a level you never thought possible.
The Vibease and Fantasy app work like this: When the voice in the fantasy app says: ""I'm touching you softly"", the vibrator vibrates softly. And when the voice says: ""I'm touching you hard"", the vibrator vibrates hard. The vibrator reacts to the story within the Fantasy. The vibrations are personalized to each Fantasy, and it gives vibrations with different intensities and various patterns at just the right moments.
It's like the perfect partner that knows how to touch you at the right moment in the right way.
In the future we will also use binaural audio (3D audio) to make it even more real. Binaural audio gives sensation for the listener of actually being in the room with the performers. You can feel as if the person is beside you.

Fantasy Library: Harnessing the power of the spoken word
Fantasies are natural and positive elements of a woman's sexuality. Women who fantasize show higher rates of satisfaction. Women's fantasies tend to be less graphic and more emotional and intimate than men's. That's why we created a library of audio stories that will usher you away into an exciting world of fantasy. We provide a comprehensive library for you to find a fantasy that suits your mood. Each Fantasy contains audio and non-explicit images. It does not contain any video.

 
Create Your Own Customized Fantasies
If you can't find any fantasies that suit your mood. The Fantasy App allows you to record your partner's voice and insert the varying levels of vibration to coincide with the audio content. The vibrations are fully customizable. Once you finish recording, you can replay it whenever you want to. Creating your own customized fantasies with your partner is fun, exciting and will surely add to the physical and emotional richness of your relationship.
You can even upload your own personal fantasy to the Fantasy Library and let other people listen to your fantasy.

Long Distance Intimacy
With the Vibease Intimate App, long distance relationships just might become people's preference. The Vibease Intimate app allows your partner to control the vibrations from anywhere in the world. It doesn't matter if your partner is in the office or in another country, you can still have your intimate moments. Distance doesn't matter.


The app has a private messaging system for you to share intimate conversations. And most importantly, your partner can create special moves and vibrations to give you a pleasant surprise.
If you're in a long distance relationship, you definitely need to have the Vibease Intimate App.

Vibrator design and specifications
We carefully designed the Vibease Smart Vibrator with modern women in mind. We wanted to make something both discreet and beautiful. The Vibease Smart Vibrator is designed for clitoral stimulation. Statistics indicate that 80 percent of women require clitoral stimulation to attain orgasm.
Vibease vibrator is small, measuring only 3.1 inches long. Good things really do come in small packages :) It is made from 100% body-safe silicone for a soft and comfortable feeling. Other features of the Vibease Smart Vibrator include:

Compatible with most Android phones and latest iPhones.

Strong vibrations with customizable pulsations to provide as realistic an experience as possible.
Rechargeable battery lasting up to three hours. The battery can be charged through USB.
Waterproof and easy to clean.
Can be used as a standalone vibrator in case you don't have your smartphone.
Communicates with your smartphone via Bluetooth connectivity. Bluetooth 2.1 for the Android app and Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) for the iPhone app.

Wearable
Making the vibrator small, discreet and wearable is the one of the top requests we received from women for numerous reasons:

Mandatory for complete immersive experience. You can relax and enjoy your moment.
A total hands-free experience and your fingers will not get tired.
Discreet. No one will know that you're having a good time.

We spent much time designing a comfortable, wearable vibrator. We wanted to create something easy to use, allowing women to slip it inside the undergarment whenever they wanted. After many different designs we found the solution by redesigning the tip. The tip is specially designed to make it easy for women to locate the sweet spot while ensuring the vibrator remains steadily in place. We do not recommend wearing the Vibease vibrator during outdoor activities.

Vibease Apps
We are currently finishing development of two Vibease apps: Vibease Fantasy and Vibease Intimate. It will be available in both Android and iPhone versions. We will release the app in September before we ship the vibrators. The apps will be free to all Vibease customers. During the process we will invite our early backers to test our apps and provide valuable feedback. Currently we have a beta app for Android.

This is just the beginning. We have more exciting apps in the pipe line. Our research and development team is working hard to design and create more exciting Vibease apps that will enrich you and your partner's lives and relationship.
 
 
Risks and Challenges
There are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product on a large scale. Mass manufacturing isn't the same as prototype development. Not all electronics manufacturers created equal. Every manufacturer has their own expertise, because every product has its own manufacturing challenges. The quality of our product was of paramount concern. We will not deliver a mediocre product. The devil is in the details, which is why selecting the right manufacturing partner was a top priority.



Successful business organizations surround themselves with experts. After vetting several candidates, we partnered with one of the biggest sex toy manufacturers in China to ensure the Vibease would meet our high manufacturing standards in terms of safety, quality and reliability. We've been working with our manufacturing partners for the past few months, perfecting the product to make it ready for mass production. They have manufactured high-quality vibrators for some of the most famous sex toy brands in the US and Europe. By working with experienced sex toy manufacturers, we have reduced the hardware-related challenges significantly, and avoided costly mistakes.
However, there is always the risk of unexpected circumstances delaying our delivery. We assure you that we will work hard to mitigate those risks. We plan to be 100% transparent throughout the delivery process.

Do we ship Internationally and what are the shipping costs?
All shipping in the US is free of charge. Estimated shipping cost to Canada is $10 and an estimated $15 for international shipping.

<p><b>Does the simple phrase “pool party”
send you or someone you love running for the hills? Us too.</b> That’s why it’s
time to give every body a bikini body this summer through the power of media
literacy.</p>
<p>Since 1997, About-Face has taught girls to understand
and question their media environment, including unrealistic beauty ideals that
leave so many women worried about taking off their swimsuit cover-up so they can
hop in the pool and have fun with their friends and families. </p>
It’s time for you to make a splash with your contribution to this About-Face campaign! <b>The campaign funding will go toward providing an 8-session About-Face program for young women in San Francisco this fall.</b><p></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Why Girls Need You</h3><p>Young women are feeling a lot of pain, fear, and anxiety in dressing rooms all over the United States, where they’re trying
on swimsuits, shorts, dresses, and all kinds of other summer clothes — the kind
of feelings that make them not want to even go to the pool party, the beach,
the garden party, the 4th of July BBQ. What will they miss out on?</p><p>
</p><p><b>In fact, for girls who feel poorly about their bodies, it's serious: Girls suffer from depression, self-harming, eating disorders, and even commit suicide.</b></p><p>Last fall, when we asked girls in our Media
Advocacy Group at Washington High School to come up with one of the top
body-image issues they face as girls, they told us that the sizing at stores
made them feel poorly and less likely to do the things they want in life.
<b>Here’s what they told us.</b></p>

I created this fundraiser for my good friend named Matthew Swift, who I grew up surfing with everyday. He is a talented surfer with an extremely positive personality keeping the island style ""Aloha Spirit"" through life's up's and down's.  He recently fell off a TWO STORY BUILDING while working a construction job resulting in a shattered heel and multiple broken bones in his foot.</p>
<p>      Matthew Swift is undergoing 3 surgeries each 8-10 hours long to repair his badly injured foot. He has a minimum of 6 months of recovery and rehabilitation to learn how to walk again. </p>
<p>      Matt is the kind of person who never asks for anything and is stoked on life, please help me raise money to get a custom shaped surfboard that will be presented to him in order to keep him motivated and positive throughout his recovery. If you surf then you know how it feels to get a new board, especially riding one.</p>
<p>    The Board will be shaped by CARROZZA SURFBOARDS out of Long Beach, CA. I will personally complete the artwork/graphics, and extra $ will go towards a deck pad, leash, fins, and gear to get this surfer back in the ocean!</p>

<h3><b>Medical <b>Mission Team and Church Plant Revisits </b>
</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>I am asking the Lord of the harvest to allow me to return to Uganda July 23<sup>rd</sup> through August 13<sup>th</sup>. I will be returning to the islands of Lake Victoria with a medical mission team and to the Bugiri region to revisit, encourage and teach at churches that have been planted in the last four years.  The medical mission team is connected with the mission work of James and Sonya Herron, African-American missionaries with the International Mission Board.  The Ugandan churches in the Bugiri region were planted by Ugandan churches desiring to plant a church within 20 minutes walking distance in the remote bush of Uganda.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Prayers and Goats and Worm Pills and Corrugated Roofs Needed</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>In order to go, we need your prayers and your money to support these churches and to buy medical supplies. Would you be willing to spend $10 to provide a church a Lugandan Bible? Or $40 for a goat to help sustain the churches in these remote villages? Or two goats (male and female) will over a couple of years will provide milk and meat for many. Or $50 for worm pills for a small island’s day clinic? Or $100 corrugated tin for an open air church roof. Or $2,500 for land and a primitive church structure? Would you send money to buy food, seed or school supplies for a seminary student? Or $135 for a year of seminary training? All the funds go toward helping Africans and none toward the cost of my travel to Uganda.</p>

</div></div>","Medical Mission Team and Church Plant Revisits 


I am asking the Lord of the harvest to allow me to return to Uganda July 23rd through August 13th. I will be returning to the islands of Lake Victoria with a medical mission team and to the Bugiri region to revisit, encourage and teach at churches that have been planted in the last four years.  The medical mission team is connected with the mission work of James and Sonya Herron, African-American missionaries with the International Mission Board.  The Ugandan churches in the Bugiri region were planted by Ugandan churches desiring to plant a church within 20 minutes walking distance in the remote bush of Uganda.

Prayers and Goats and Worm Pills and Corrugated Roofs Needed

In order to go, we need your prayers and your money to support these churches and to buy medical supplies. Would you be willing to spend $10 to provide a church a Lugandan Bible? Or $40 for a goat to help sustain the churches in these remote villages? Or two goats (male and female) will over a couple of years will provide milk and meat for many. Or $50 for worm pills for a small island’s day clinic? Or $100 corrugated tin for an open air church roof. Or $2,500 for land and a primitive church structure? Would you send money to buy food, seed or school supplies for a seminary student? Or $135 for a year of seminary training? All the funds go toward helping Africans and none toward the cost of my travel to Uganda.


The needs are large. The Holy Spirit is doing might things to bring glory and donor to God the Father through His one and only Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior! Please help us be more effective by joining us with prayer and financial support.



Please pray for the harvest to be plentiful, for money for Bibles, medical supplies and church support!
All of the money given in support of the churches, orphans and medical mission trip. None will be used for my travel.  The trip is conducted by O'Fallon Baptist Church with funds also collected by Memphis Fellowship.
You can also make checks out to Fellowship Memphis Church (P.O. Box 11465, Memphis, TN 38111) with memo Mike Studdard, Uganda.

I was 176lbs, Last July I weighed in at 156lbs and today I am around 138lbs, my goal is to look fit and not really focus on my weight in particular and while my hips have stayed my boobs have decided to say goodbye to me, already having dropped from a 36DD/DDD to a 34C and losing. I have wanted a boob job for years now but haven't been in a healthy place to get one. And, not having enough money to get one I ask you my fans to help me. If every one of you donated $1-$2 I would easily have enough to make my dream a reality. </p>
<p>Also, I am not looking to go over the top and be mis-proportioned. I simply want a natural hourglass shape instead of a pear shape. I want it to look as natural as possible. I plan on getting Cohesive Silicone Gel Implants and if you don't know much about them or the differences between implant types watch this informational video. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGr5R8Bu5R8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGr5R8Bu5R8</a> </p>
<p>I plan on going to a highly qualified surgeon for this type of implant. Who uses insertion cuts that are smaller and heal more naturally. I want to look natural and have the natural slope in my chest. But since you can't grow boobs the way you can grow muscle augmentation is the option I have for feeling more like me again. While some may not understand my reasons for wanting this surgery or feel like I shouldn't get an augmentation, please keep in mind that it is for me and for my personal confidence and well-being. I want to feel proud of my body again. My chest is a big part of my body confidence and now I don't have it anymore. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need</h3> <p>Break down:</p> <ul>
<li>$8000 is the average price for this type silicone implants plus the additional medical costs of the surgery. This money would be going straight towards the surgery and costs associated with it and will not be used for anything other.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Perks for larger donations will be detailed on twitter or you can email me. </span></li> <li>If I don't reach my goal my funds will be placed in a savings account that will continue to be added onto until I do reach it whether with help or by myself.

<li>I will be getting cohesive gel silicone implants with a periareolar incision for the most natural look possible.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Getting these implants will make me feel better about myself. Over the years I grew accustomed to my large chest and loved showing it off. But, feeling the need to be fit and healthy set me on a path toward personal fitness.  My weight loss has me still fighting with the fact that while I am curvy still I don't feel like me, having already dropped in cup size from a DD/DDD to a C and still losing.  On the other end of things they will enhance my modeling/adult career as well, though that is just a side effect and not the reason for this.

</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For those of you who do not know me, my name is Michael
Vincent. The reason my mom and I have started this “campaign” in hopes of
raising the funds necessary to send my uncle and grandmother to Florida. My uncle,
Michael Hurst, was diagnosed with anaplastic astrocytoma, an incurable type of
brain cancer. One of his life's dreams has been to swim with the dolphins. We are
hoping to make this dream come true but need the help of friends and friends of
friends. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Here is a bit more background on my uncle and grandmother: </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">January 25, 2012 we were blinded-sided when my uncle had to
be rushed to the hospital because he was having seizures. Then our lives completely
changed we were told that the seizures were due to a tumor in his brain that
later was biopsied and showed stage three cancer. He survived two surgeries,
one to put a stunt in and remove the pressure, the other to remove the tumor.
He was in ICU for several days and in the hospital for over two weeks. He had
to work at getting his memory back and at doing simple things like walking. He
then went through several weeks of radiation and chemotherapy. We have been
blessed with him being in remission for over a year; however, we recently
learned that the tumor had grown back, (we were told it would, but like most
people, we had hoped the doctors were wrong). He will be having another surgery
on his brain sometime in the next few weeks. The doctors all feel as though
this is his best chance at living a bit longer. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you have never met Mike, let me tell you that he is a
gentle soul, with a kind heart, an infectious smile, a hardworking man and a
much loved person by family and friends. He is a man that finds great joy in
the simple things in life, and is also extremely generous. He is an avid sports
fan, (loves the buffs, the Av’s, the broncos and for some reason the Duke
basketball team). He enjoys playing golf, skiing, fishing, going bowling, ice
skating, swimming and is pretty darn good at hoops. Mike has always loved
animals and though we are not sure how it happened, he loves dolphins (course
who doesn’t).</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Please follow the link below to watch a short inspirational documentary I made for and about my uncle, called ""The Fighter: An Unfinished Story."" </p><p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmS7xabKgd8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmS7xabKgd8</a><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Many of you may know Mike because he is the son of my
grandmother, Bonnie Hurst. For over thirty years she was the best kindergarten
teacher in the world!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">She loved and nurtured each and every child who passed
through the door of her classroom. To this day many of her students still
remember her as their favorite teacher. Whether you have or have not had the
pleasure of knowing her as a teacher, you should also know that she is the most
loving, kind, generous, forgiving soul you will ever meet. She loves her family
beyond words; and, I think we can all agree that no parent should have to watch
their child, (even if that child is now an adult), battle an illness or watch
them be in pain. This is an extremely difficult time for her, I mean, <span style=""""> </span>she is the mom after all. </p>

I've been working since I was 13, with the goal of eventually having a business of my own to grow from the ground up. A business that would benefit my community, that would improve peoples' lives, and help people to be their best selves. Good news - I'm almost there! </p><p><span>Halcyon Floats will be the first Float Center in Philadelphia. Located in Northern Liberties, we are excited to bring the progressive technique of sensory deprivation to our hometown community. </span></p><p> Never heard of Floating?</p><p>That’s okay! It’s easy to understand the benefits, and it’s<br/>easy to float. Let me give you some info about floating, as well as why<br/>everyone can benefit from it.</p><br/><p>Imagine a tank filled with water 10 inches deep, heated the<br/>skin temperature. Mixed in the water is over 1000 lbs of epsoms salts, making<br/>it completely sterile, and making you completely buoyant. The tanks are<br/>soundproof and pitch dark, allowing for you to rest all of your senses. With<br/>your body free from the pull of gravity, your spine releases and stretches<br/>freely as you enjoy the sensation of what seems to be floating in air. Once you<br/>finally hit full relaxation, your brain begins to produce Theta waves, allowing<br/>you to experience perfect clarity of thought, crispness of creativity, and the<br/>deepest meditation. These waves are normally only produced when falling asleep<br/>or waking. By restricting your sensory intake you are allowing yourself to<br/>reach and maintain a level of rest that is next to impossible otherwise. One<br/>hour in the tank is equivalent to 4 hours of sleep.</p><br/><p>As if the ability to achieve that level of calm was not enough, there is an extensive list of benefits to go along:<br/> </p><ul>
<li>Reduces stress and stress related pain &amp; illness<br/>
</li> <li>Helps eliminate addictive behavior, including weight loss<br/>
</li> <li>Creates an ideal environment for meditation &amp; lucid dreaming<br/>
</li> <li>Is ideal for managing back pain throughout pregnancy<br/>
</li> <li>Enhances higher learning and aids in visualization<br/>
</li> <li>Speeds healing and recovery from physical activity and injury<br/>
</li> <li>Relieves pain from illness and injury,<br/>
</li> <li>Increases harmonious brain patterns<br/>
</li> <li>Enhances the creativity process<br/>
</li> <li>Speeds recovery from jet lag and exhaustion<br/>
</li> <li>Lowers blood pressure, and cortisol level<br/>
</li> <li>Improves athletic performance<br/>
</li> <li>Cleanses the body of toxins</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><p>It's simple, we need help funding our first few months of business in order to bring affordable floats to our community.</p><p>With the understanding that money is tight we are asking for your support in the form of a $1 donation accompanied by 1 share.  In return, you will be entered in a drawing to win a 90 minute float.</p><p>If you would like to donate more, please do!

I've been working since I was 13, with the goal of eventually having a business of my own to grow from the ground up. A business that would benefit my community, that would improve peoples' lives, and help people to be their best selves. Good news - I'm almost there! Halcyon Floats will be the first Float Center in Philadelphia. Located in Northern Liberties, we are excited to bring the progressive technique of sensory deprivation to our hometown community.  Never heard of Floating?That’s okay! It’s easy to understand the benefits, and it’seasy to float. Let me give you some info about floating, as well as whyeveryone can benefit from it.Imagine a tank filled with water 10 inches deep, heated theskin temperature. Mixed in the water is over 1000 lbs of epsoms salts, makingit completely sterile, and making you completely buoyant. The tanks aresoundproof and pitch dark, allowing for you to rest all of your senses. Withyour body free from the pull of gravity, your spine releases and stretchesfreely as you enjoy the sensation of what seems to be floating in air. Once youfinally hit full relaxation, your brain begins to produce Theta waves, allowingyou to experience perfect clarity of thought, crispness of creativity, and thedeepest meditation. These waves are normally only produced when falling asleepor waking. By restricting your sensory intake you are allowing yourself toreach and maintain a level of rest that is next to impossible otherwise. Onehour in the tank is equivalent to 4 hours of sleep.As if the ability to achieve that level of calm was not enough, there is an extensive list of benefits to go along: 
Reduces stress and stress related pain & illness
 Helps eliminate addictive behavior, including weight loss
 Creates an ideal environment for meditation & lucid dreaming
 Is ideal for managing back pain throughout pregnancy
 Enhances higher learning and aids in visualization
 Speeds healing and recovery from physical activity and injury
 Relieves pain from illness and injury,
 Increases harmonious brain patterns
 Enhances the creativity process
 Speeds recovery from jet lag and exhaustion
 Lowers blood pressure, and cortisol level
 Improves athletic performance
 Cleanses the body of toxins
 What We Need & What You GetIt's simple, we need help funding our first few months of business in order to bring affordable floats to our community.With the understanding that money is tight we are asking for your support in the form of a $1 donation accompanied by 1 share.  In return, you will be entered in a drawing to win a 90 minute float.If you would like to donate more, please do!

<p>Bella was born with Osteogenisis Imperfecta. It is also referred to as brittle bone disease.</p>
<p>Bella has two older brothers Landon and Tyler and two loving parents Bill and Mindy.</p>

<h2>Bella’s Story</h2>
<p>Bella’s mom Mindy went for her seven month ultrasound when the doctor noticed that the baby’s limbs were much shorter than they were supposed to be. A more detailed ultrasound would reveal that she also had numerous fractures throughout her small frame, along with bowing in her arms and legs. Her skull showed signs of being demineralized.</p>
<p>Because of the severity of her broken limbs she was diagnosed as having type III which is severe.</p>
<p>The doctors told Mindy and Bill that their baby would not survive birth.</p>
<p>Many infants pass away from respiratory difficulties. Children that do survive past infancy often do not grow past three feet tall and spend most of their life in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Bella was born on January 30th 2009. She was a miracle.</p>
<p>She weighed 5 lbs 7 ounces and was 16 inches long. Her family had to carry her on a pillow because she was so fragile.</p>
<p>During her first few months of life she suffered numerous breaks and so she started receiving infusions of pamidronate to help with the pain and to thicken her bones.</p>
<p>Even with the infusions her limbs would keep breaking.</p>
<p>She would often break both arms so she would accommodate herself by using her feet to hold her bottle.</p>
<p>She continued to have many breaks so to strengthen and reinforce her bones she had rodding surgeries in her legs and upper arms. She will need additional surgeries as she grows to replace them.</p>
<p>Because she started having a lot of spinal fractures she started on a new treatment called zolendronate.</p>
<p>She’s had a decrease in spinal fractures and so she continues to receive these treatments every four months.</p>
<p>Bella also has brittle teeth. Her front tooth recently just suddenly broke off.</p>
<p>The dentist said she will need her teeth capped to keep them from breaking and to help her be able to eat more foods. Bella‘s diet consists of mostly very soft foods.</p>
<p>Bella just turned 4. She is very small for her age. She is 25 inches long and weighs 16 lbs. She is very intelligent for her age. She enjoys going to preschool twice a week. She loves to sing and dance and enjoys being a special princess. She continues to exceed her expectations.</p>
<p>She enjoys physical therapy and water therapy each week. Water therapy is a way for her to strengthen her muscles.</p>
<p>She strives to become stronger everyday.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday she will achieve her dream of being able to walk.</p>
<p>Bill works very hard just to make ends meet for his family. Mindy provides constant care for her daughter and is not able to work outside the home.</p>
<p>Because Bella’s condition is so rare the family has to travel to see specialist’s familiar with treating children with OI.</p>
<p>Her family is burdened with ongoing medical cost and travel expenses. They family desperately needs a new vehicle that can accommodate her. Her home needs to be modified to fit her needs. See complete list of Bella’s needs for details…</p>
<p>Friends and family are reaching out to ask for help.</p>

<p>My name is Stephanie Rigdon, and Gina Grimes is my cousin. Recently, she has had some health problems. This began over a month ago with a peristent fever, fatigue and a rash, and has now progressed to extreme swelling, low hemoglobin count and internal bleeding. At first, the signs pointed to lupus, but with the increasing complications it is unclear what is the root condition. The internal bleeding stopped on its own yesterday, and is thought to be the result of a liver biopsy that was done. Her kidneys were not working properly, and it was exacerbated by draining the fluid in her body and medication. Today, she is bing transfered to another hospital to begin dialysis and there has been talk of cancer being a possibility. The truth is, they do not know what is afflicting Gina and it seems the road to a diagnosis will be a long one; with the one to recovery being even longer.</p>
<p>Gina is a devoted and loved mother, granddaughter, daughter, wife, sister, aunt, niece, cousin and former teacher. She has two young children at home, and gave up teaching in order to stay at home with them. She has also been the caretaker of my two year old daughter for most of her life. She has been an inspiration to many chlldren in her lifetime. Her husband is also a teacher, and being a teacher at a private school, does not provide with the best health insurance, unfortunately.Their medical bills are accumulating rapidly with no end in sight, so ANY money donated will go directly to paying any medical expenses not coveredy by insurance (estimates so far are upward of $9,000). The holidays are not the easiest times to worry about money in addition to worrying about your health and having to be away from your family.</p>
<p>Gina is so young, and this could easily happen to any one of us in an instant. Any financial support is obviously appreciated during this Christmas season, but so are positive comments, prayers and spreading her story to others. It would be great to know just how much people really care! </p>
<p>An account has also been set up for Gina through thirty-one, because she also sells these products. My sister, Mandy Storm, does as well and has agreed to process these special orders. All prodeeds raised (as well as commission) will go directly to Gina. You can check out what you like and contact Mandy at mythirtyone.com/alstorm</p>

On june 19, 2012 she was having a sleepover at her friends house. She was laying on the couch and rolled off and her friends dog (jack russel, bull dog mix) was laying there and began to growl, when Jacklyn got up to get on the couch the dog viciously pounced and attacked my daughter tearing off her upper right side of her lip, nostril, and cheek. She couldn't get the dog off and it also took a chunk of her left side just beneath her arm and tore it open and bit her on the back of her left arm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That is the worst phone call i have ever received. She had to be trauma hawked to the st mary's trauma center in west palm beach, fl where they began an emergency repair on her face. The surgeon was able to put her original skin back on but he said it will not work because the blood vessel was unrepairable. He had my daughter go through one and a half weeks of hyperbaric treatment to see if they could get blood flowing to her skin. The treatment did not work and the skin died.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We had to go to the Joe Dimaggio childrens hospital in hollywood, fl for her to see a facial reconstructive surgeon. The surgeon forwarned me of many future surgeries to repair her face. The next morning she went to surgery and was in for 6 hrs of surgery. He was able to use the live skin on her face and lower lip to save the damaged area. It was a very horrific experience that I hope no parent has to go through. My daughters mouth is now stiched shut for three weeks and cannot eat solid food. I told Jacklyn that i would stay at her side the entire time and i have. I have not been back to work since the accident so i can take care of her while she has her face stitched up. The medical bills are piling up and our home bills are starting to pile up. Jacklyn will also have to have cosmetic surgeries in the future also that we need to have money for. I just can't do this myself but i don't want my daughter to stay with a damaged face. She needs the cosmetic surgeries so she will be normal and not self concious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a plea for help from any and everyone to help achieve our goal of $225,000 for everything that needs to be paid and done in the future. Even if we do not meet our goal anything will help our situation. My daughter deserves to have her face back.

<h3>
<strong>Y</strong><strong>ES! She's finally doing it.</strong>
</h3>
<p>Misch is going to massage school.</p>
<p>For years I've been giving friends, family, and colleagues little massages for the pleasure of doing so, but without really knowing what I'm doing. It's all been instinct and feedback.*</p>
<p>I was laid off a few months ago and decided to take this as an opportunity to make good on that long-expressed intention to learn and train and share this gift. Massage therapy is also a portable skill to build professional practice upon, and I'm excited by the range of ways I'd like to use it.</p>
<p>Everyone has been so wonderfully encouraging that I'm launching this campaign as a way for you to tangibly contribute--with perks courtesy of my soon-to-be ""magic"" hands.</p>
<h3>The goals: CMT, 500 hours, $3325</h3>
<p>My current goal is to become a Certified Massage Therapist, which in California requires 500 hours of coursework plus practice. It's the middle level of professional certification and will lay a solid, well-rounded foundation to begin working in the field. </p>
<p>I'm attending a wonderful school, <a href=""http://www.mckinnonmassage.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">McKinnon</a> in Oakland. <strong>Tuition for 500 hours, not including textbooks, is $6635; I've already paid about half, and this campaign goal of $3325</strong> is toward the rest.</p>
<p>I researched scholarships quite a bit and have found none that I qualify for; McKinnon doesn't offer financial aid, and no state job re-training funds are available. So this is our own deal. The campaign spans the holidays and ends next Valentine's Day--share the love.</p>
<h3><strong>The perks for contributing</strong></h3>
<p>Why, <em>massage</em>, of course.</p>
<p>Basically, every dollar entitles you to either 2 minutes of ""guinea pig"" (practice hours) or 1 minute of ""pro"" (once I'm certified). We can mix, too. Perks are transferable; GIFT me!</p>
<p>Seattle friends, I'll be in town Dec 19 through Jan 2. However, I'm not sure what I'll do about not having a massage table. Anybody have a portable one I can borrow?</p>
<p><em>And if you're in a ""pay it backward"" position instead of a ""pay it forward""... </em>You can still be a guinea pig and cheer me on! Your guinea pig feedback helps me become a better bodyworker, and there are other ways to help, like spreading the word once I hang a sign outside my door.</p>
<p>Lastly, for a little extra fun: anyone who contributes $250 gets massage perks AND gets to choose my next hair color! Light pink? Emerald green? Zebra stripe? Can a bunch of people team up to get this one? Absolutely!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>And after?</h3>
<p>I've got a ton of ideas about how I want to apply my skills. Many of these are inspired by YOU. </p>
<p>I'd like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use it as a vehicle to travel by studying local modalities and teaching and/or practicing abroad for a portion of each year.</li>
<li>Research touch therapies in Africa--so far in reading I have come across discussion of the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, but NOTHING in Africa, which has amazing healing traditions, surely some with touch. Ideally I'll be student and teacher, to train a few local people in a bankable skill.</li>
<li>Work with the special needs of the elderly. And people with MS. And musicians. And cats and dogs. As well as regular folks and desk jockeys.</li>
<li>Set up a ""scholarship"" fund so I can give massages to people who can't afford it and to the underserved, like veterans with PTSD. Maybe even organize a non-profit for it.</li>
<li>Explore lots of healing modalities (reiki?) and see where this all leads...</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Humbly yours,</p>
<p>Misch</p>
<p> </p>
<div>* And the occasional challenge. My friend Eric told me about this singular spot from an old neck injury that only ONE person had ever been able to find, and it was such a release that he'd passed out. A few minutes later, I became person number two.</div>
</div></div>","YES! She's finally doing it.

I'm attending a wonderful school, McKinnon in Oakland. Tuition for 500 hours, not including textbooks, is $6635; I've already paid about half, and this campaign goal of $3325 is toward the rest.
I researched scholarships quite a bit and have found none that I qualify for; McKinnon doesn't offer financial aid, and no state job re-training funds are available. So this is our own deal. The campaign spans the holidays and ends next Valentine's Day--share the love.
The perks for contributing
Why, massage, of course.
Basically, every dollar entitles you to either 2 minutes of ""guinea pig"" (practice hours) or 1 minute of ""pro"" (once I'm certified). We can mix, too. Perks are transferable; GIFT me!
Seattle friends, I'll be in town Dec 19 through Jan 2. However, I'm not sure what I'll do about not having a massage table. Anybody have a portable one I can borrow?
And if you're in a ""pay it backward"" position instead of a ""pay it forward""... You can still be a guinea pig and cheer me on! Your guinea pig feedback helps me become a better bodyworker, and there are other ways to help, like spreading the word once I hang a sign outside my door.
Lastly, for a little extra fun: anyone who contributes $250 gets massage perks AND gets to choose my next hair color! Light pink? Emerald green? Zebra stripe? Can a bunch of people team up to get this one? Absolutely!


And after?
I've got a ton of ideas about how I want to apply my skills. Many of these are inspired by YOU. 
I'd like to:

Use it as a vehicle to travel by studying local modalities and teaching and/or practicing abroad for a portion of each year.
Research touch therapies in Africa--so far in reading I have come across discussion of the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, but NOTHING in Africa, which has amazing healing traditions, surely some with touch. Ideally I'll be student and teacher, to train a few local people in a bankable skill.
Work with the special needs of the elderly. And people with MS. And musicians. And cats and dogs. As well as regular folks and desk jockeys.
Set up a ""scholarship"" fund so I can give massages to people who can't afford it and to the underserved, like veterans with PTSD. Maybe even organize a non-profit for it.
Explore lots of healing modalities (reiki?) and see where this all leads...

Thank you!
Humbly yours,
Misch

<h3><span>ABOUT THE DEFINE BOTTLE TEAM</span></h3>
<h3>
<br/><span>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about us. </span><br/><span>Before I discuss the bottle, I would like to give you a little background on how it came about - it’s a pretty cool story.  For the past few years my son and I would make fruit infused water everyday in either a countertop vessel or in a pitcher that would fit in the refrigerator. However, when I would run out, I would always grab a diet soda or artificially sweetened water. One day, my son asked why don’t you just take fruit infused water with you. I explained to him that I cant just throw fruit in to a water bottle because it would float up to the mouth piece and swell and get stuck in the bottom of the bottle. Trust me, I had a few bottles with science experiments growing in the bottom. I couldn't get the fruit out.</span>
</h3>
<h3>
<br/><span>That was my son’s  “Aha” moment where he turned into a 14 year old entrepreneur. He developed sketches of what he had in mind, did a lot of research on how you develop a product and pitched it to my husband and I. Instantly we both thought it was a great idea not only for your health but for the environment too.</span>
</h3>
<h3>
<br/><span>It has been a lot of work and it has taken us over 9 months to get us to the point to where we are today. Once we knew we were going to invest in this monetarily and pour tons of time and energy in to it, we enlisted the help of an industrial design firm in Los Angeles. We are currently in the tooling/molding phase and our first run will be in early November with delivery to the United States in December.</span>

<h3>
<br/><span>Our industrial design team offers end-to-end product design and development out of its studio in Los Angeles, CA.

ABOUT THE DEFINE BOTTLE TEAM

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about us. Before I discuss the bottle, I would like to give you a little background on how it came about - it’s a pretty cool story.  For the past few years my son and I would make fruit infused water everyday in either a countertop vessel or in a pitcher that would fit in the refrigerator. However, when I would run out, I would always grab a diet soda or artificially sweetened water. One day, my son asked why don’t you just take fruit infused water with you. I explained to him that I cant just throw fruit in to a water bottle because it would float up to the mouth piece and swell and get stuck in the bottom of the bottle. Trust me, I had a few bottles with science experiments growing in the bottom. I couldn't get the fruit out.


That was my son’s  “Aha” moment where he turned into a 14 year old entrepreneur. He developed sketches of what he had in mind, did a lot of research on how you develop a product and pitched it to my husband and I. Instantly we both thought it was a great idea not only for your health but for the environment too.


It has been a lot of work and it has taken us over 9 months to get us to the point to where we are today. Once we knew we were going to invest in this monetarily and pour tons of time and energy in to it, we enlisted the help of an industrial design firm in Los Angeles. We are currently in the tooling/molding phase and our first run will be in early November with delivery to the United States in December.


Our industrial design team offers end-to-end product design and development out of its studio in Los Angeles, CA. They provide Industrial Design, User Experience, Mechanical Engineering, in addition to Supply Chain Setup, Manufacturing Support, and Quality Control services to their clients.


An Design Lab works with multiple factories which we got samples from and quotes. We picked one that was not the cheapest but had the samples closest to our vision and has experience in working with glass and bamboo.We were looking for great craftsmanship and quality materials.We are through the design and prototype stages and have also completed the patent process with an intellectual property firm out of San Francisco (filed for a Utility Patent). We also have a branding expert from San Diego helping to bring the vision to reality. We figured if we were going to do this then let's do it right and find a team of experts to help make our vision a reality.


Through our industrial Design team we have selected a factory that is not necessarily the cheapest but has the craftsmanship and quality that we were looking for.  It truly is a beautiful bottle and it makes you feel great to see your fresh fruit floating in your bottle and knowing that you are doing something great for your body and the environment! It really is one of those things where people will stop and ask you about it.


Now I introduce you to my son Carter:


My name is Carter. Six months ago I began formulating a concept in my mind to give people the tools they need to choose healthy options.  The Define Bottle is the result of my efforts. It is a cutting edge, glass and bamboo reusable water bottle for great tasting fruit infused water. I took the idea behind fruit infused water pitchers and made it mobile, not to mention stylish.


After watching “super size me”, I began to research about the negative health effects of soda and juice. Diabetes and obesity sounded like terrible diseases and I desired to do something about it.  I saw the need to make a sustainable, portable version of fruit infused water pitchers for people on the go. The only other option for health conscious people is for them to buy plain water or plastic bottles of artificially flavored and sweetened water beverages.


I also wanted to to do something good for the environment. The amount of disposable plastic bottles we use is ridiculous and the carbon footprint of a plastic water bottle is not something I want to think about every time I take a drink.


So I wanted the product to be healthy, environmentally friendly, and fill a void in the market. Here are the features I knew it must have:- A great look. I wanted the bottle to be the best looking water bottle anyone has ever seen.- Functional. It must keep the fruit cool, and keep the fruit and ice away from the spout to prevent snarfing a large piece of orange when taking a drink.

- Perfect size. It must be large enough to hold a decent amount of water, but not too big or else it will be too heavy or not fit in standard cup holders.
With these ideas in mind, I set out to create a sketch and that started the ball rolling.  Our goal is to have an alternative way to hydrate on the go and not be forced to grab a soda, artificially flavored water or juice and to do something that is good for our bodies and the environment.

We sincerely thank you for taking the time to learn more about us and we hope you will have a bottle in your hand soon!

<h3>Who are We?</h3>
<p>Founded in 2006 by a group of west Texas physicians, Mercy Trips is a non-denominational Christian team of healthcare workers who partner with local doctors and nurses to provide free medical clinics, surgical procedures, and health education to underserved areas in Uganda, Africa. Our teams include compassionate individuals from all backgrounds and experience levels. Our goal is to provide medical relief but also disease prevention.  Each team member/volunteer pays or raises his or her own expenses each trip. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS are used to purchase medications, mosquito nets, vaccinations and surgical supplies. When funds permit, we partner with local foundations to provide clean water sources and medical training for locals who aspire to the medical professions. </p>
<p>Since we will use 100% of the contributions for the people we serve, we can't offer any perks. But we do want you to know that we appreciate your help immensely, and all the people who benefit from your kindness appreciate it even more! </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Our teams have been travelling to eastern Uganda twice yearly. In 2013 -2014 we would like to add two additional trips each year into western Uganda near the Congo border. In 2012 our teams were performing up to forty surgical procedures per trip and treating as many as 800 people per day in clinics! We purchase all of our supplies and medications in  Uganda to make the contributions go further. However, it's never enough and we have to turn people away every day from the medical clinics for lack of supplies. </p>
<p>Ten thousand dollars in contributions will help us ensure that the summer and winter trips this year will be better prepared to handle the extraordinary need in these rural areas. </p>
<p>1 round of malaria treatment: $10 per patient</p>
<p>1 course of typhoid treatment: $10 per patient</p>
<p>1 round of Antibiotic treatment: $5-$15 per patient</p>
<p>But prevention goes even further:</p>
<p>1 mosquito net costs $10 and can protect an entire family from malaria!!</p>
<p>1 water well in Eastern Uganda costs $2400 and can provide clean water to an entire village!</p>
<p>Surgical supplies: we ""stuff"" our luggage with local contributions and equipment but have to purchase the anesthetics, pain medications and post-op supplies.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Goals</strong></h3>
<p>1) To meet the medical and surgical needs of underserved areas in Uganda</p>
<p>2) To promote disease prevention via education and active intervention</p>
<p>3) To educate and train local healthcare professionals and encourage them to continue independently of Mercy Trips </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Most of the people we serve have no other source of healthcare. Our impact is twofold: we treat the diseases but also focus heavily on their prevention. The surgical team provides general and gynecologic procedures including major neck, abdominal and pelvic surgeries as well as numerous hernia repairs and other minor procedures to people who would otherwise go untreated. A simple hernia repair can allow a father to return to his work and keep his family fed. Basic health exams, vaccinations, de-worming of children, mosquito net distribution as well as urgent treatment of malaria, typhoid, respiratory infections and other tropical illnesses are carried out in our village outreach sites.</p>

What We Need & What You Get


Our goal is to raise at least $25,000
After possible expenses of up to $3000, that $25,000 combined with the existing $2000 in the fund currently will make $24,000.
This $24000 will start the program off with enough funds for the first 2 years. The fund will make available $1000 per month to be used for helping financially restricted youths in Whistler be able to pursue their sports dreams!

Specifically, this will be used to pay for equipment, coaching, competition fees, travel expenses, etc.
Even if we don't reach our full goal with this campaign, we will continue fundraising and doing additional campaigns and events until we get there!

We are already planning a series of public speaking events at schools in the Sea-to-sky corridor for when Dave returns home after the adventure!




The Impact


During my 10+ years coaching competitive freeskiing, I have seen over and over again, kids with the talent, desire, and passion to succeed, but without the financial backing from their family to realize their dreams. 

This program will help kids pursue their sports dreams that wouldn't be able to otherwise. 

Being able to pursue their dreams will build self confidence, improve goal setting skills, and generally improve happiness of the kids we help.

I'm <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/4368110/x/4368110"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Robin</a>.
   I'm a software developer. I have spent my career making complex software for big companies. Now, I want to make something that will help people.</p>
<p>I could not find an app that would help me
   get lean and healthy. Instead, I looked for an app for treating chronic
   diseases like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, or dementia. That’s
   because the best known treatments for those diseases are with nutrition
   and lifestyle habits. But, there were no apps delivering those treatments.</p>
<p>That's why I formed a team, incorporated <a href=""https://angel.co/paduin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our company</a>, and began making Paduin.</p>
<h3 style=""clear: both;"">About Paduin</h3>
<p>Paduin is a way to get lean and healthy. It is also a way to treat
   obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain other chronic
   diseases.</p>
<p>Paduin delivers personalized nutrition and lifestyle habits.
   It's a nutrition and lifestyle coach in your smartphone.</p>

<h3>How To Help</h3>
<p>Purchase a perk, at right, and send a message that there is demand for a way to use food to improve health!</p>
<p>We are only offering perks that we know we can deliver. So, you are guaranteed to get what you pay for.</p>
<p>Funds will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>To pay for graphic design required for the smartphone app.</li>
<li>To test Paduin with its first users.</li>
<li>To help us learn which features are most needed for users to succeed.</li>
<li>To reach more people to tell them how Paduin can help them.</li>
<li>To support the software development of version 1.</li>
<li>To pay for server costs.</li>
<li>To pay the other costs associated with the perks, like the hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Support Paduin's bigger cause!  Direct health care costs for the chronic
   diseases that have their root causes in nutrition and lifestyle choices exceed
   $1 billion per day in the U.S. alone.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/1086967/pictures/full/20131023131124-Paduin-screenshot-BuildMyMenu-640x960.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px 10px; float: right; width: 40%;""/></p>
<p>Paduin provides a low cost solution to what is already more than a
   trillion dollar yearly cost, worldwide. The potential reduction in human
   suffering by itself justifies massive investments in Paduin, and there is
   also a huge potential reduction in health care costs.
   </p>
<p>Using technology to achieve a significant reduction in chronic diseases
   of civilization is an idea whose time has come.</p>
<p>Buy a perk, at right, and support this cause!</p>

About Robin
Hello! I'm Robin.
   I'm a software developer. I have spent my career making complex software for big companies. Now, I want to make something that will help people.
I could not find an app that would help me
   get lean and healthy. Instead, I looked for an app for treating chronic
   diseases like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, or dementia. That’s
   because the best known treatments for those diseases are with nutrition
   and lifestyle habits. But, there were no apps delivering those treatments.
That's why I formed a team, incorporated our company, and began making Paduin.
About Paduin
Paduin is a way to get lean and healthy. It is also a way to treat
   obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain other chronic
   diseases.
Paduin delivers personalized nutrition and lifestyle habits.
   It's a nutrition and lifestyle coach in your smartphone.

How To Help
Purchase a perk, at right, and send a message that there is demand for a way to use food to improve health!
We are only offering perks that we know we can deliver. So, you are guaranteed to get what you pay for.
Funds will be used:

To pay for graphic design required for the smartphone app.
To test Paduin with its first users.
To help us learn which features are most needed for users to succeed.
To reach more people to tell them how Paduin can help them.
To support the software development of version 1.
To pay for server costs.
To pay the other costs associated with the perks, like the hardware.

The Impact
Support Paduin's bigger cause!  Direct health care costs for the chronic
   diseases that have their root causes in nutrition and lifestyle choices exceed
   $1 billion per day in the U.S. alone.
Paduin provides a low cost solution to what is already more than a
   trillion dollar yearly cost, worldwide. The potential reduction in human
   suffering by itself justifies massive investments in Paduin, and there is
   also a huge potential reduction in health care costs.
   
Using technology to achieve a significant reduction in chronic diseases
   of civilization is an idea whose time has come.
Buy a perk, at right, and support this cause!

<p>• My name is<strong> Rachel Yonda</strong> and I like to run! Sometimes, I like to run to raise money for a good cause. Why, you ask? <strong>Why NOT?! </strong>I created this page solo, but the actual campaign/donation will be a group effort, accomplished by all those who choose to participate by donating.</p>
<p>• I'm running a 5k this November in honor of <a href=""https://www.campronaldmcdonald.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times</strong></a>. This summer I had the opportunity to volunteer there as a counselor. I am very grateful for the profound impact it had on my life &amp; would like to give back. Every dollar rasied via this campaign page will be donated straight to Camp Ronald McDonald!!</p>
<p>• You might say, ""Well, that's great but if they have people volunteering and everyone's having a good time then they don't need anything from me!""</p>
<p>I'll steal some words from one of the greatest counselors on the mountain &amp; answer that with a big ""Nay, nay, my friend!"" <em><strong>This camp is a non-profit and while volunteering our time is priceless, let's face it- when the camp needs hiking gear, bunk beds, medical supplies, chocolate milk?

<h3>••OK how much money do you want? A million dollars? Cause I don't have a million dollars!••</h3>
<div>Every little bit helps! You don't spread much awareness with just a few large donations, but you spread major awaresness with *lots* of little donations! The point is to get as many people involved as possible. <strong>How about 5 bucks ($1 per Kilometer)? Since I'll match every buck up to $250, we could easily get $500 together! </strong>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>••But you are only running 5k. That's wimpy baby stuff. I only pledge to people running super-ultra-megadeath-marathons!••</h3>
<p>I have other races to run this year and the 5K is indeed the shortest one. Actually, it's my first 5K (I've never run anything shorter than 10K). But, this event is the most appropriate to the cause. You'll see why in the next question.</p>
<h3>••I WANT PROOF you ran this 5K. When/where is it so I can hide in the bushes with binoculars and confirm your participation?••</h3>
<p>The 5K I am running is<a href=""http://thecolorrun.com/sandiego/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> The Color Run 5K, taking place in San Diego on Saturday November 3rd, 2012</a>. I'll sporting the CRMFGT T-Shirt. Out of all the races I'm running this year I figured this would be the best one to raise money for camp because</p>
<p>•1• there are lots of families participating and everyone gets covered in rainbow colors during the race which is crazy fun</p>
<p>•2• there will be LOTS of photos taken, and <strong>I will be making a fool out of myself to make sure the CRMFGT logo on my shirt gets in as many pictures as possible</strong>! Raising awareness FTW!</p>

<p><strong>OUR STORY</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>The Share Your Voice Foundation's mission is simple.  We believe strongly in the transformative power of the arts to change lives and are dedicated to helping young people (primarily underprivileged teens in rural areas ages 13-17) transform their lives through powerful arts-based programs like the Empowerment through Performance (ETP) Workshop program. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>Thank you for watching our video (feel free to check out others on our <a href=""http://vimeo.com/user10077743"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vimeo</a> page). It's been a remarkable journey thus far and we're so proud to still be going strong - changing the lives of a special group of young people each year, one summer at a time. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>SYVF serves these teens regardless of race, religion, creed, sex or socio-economic status.  We are committed to making a difference through the tremendous power of the arts by helping them find and share their voice to promote positive difference.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>We ask for your support in making this vision come true in 2012.  It will not happen without your contribution. The workshop is being held July 16-20 with the final performance night for the community, 'Night at the Landing' being held at beautiful Stillwater Landing, 15 miles from Whitefish in Northwest Montana on Saturday, July 21.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>Funds raised on IndieGoGo ensure we can run the 2012 workshop and also contribute to recording the song the participants write with a singer-songwriter during the workshop. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>SYVF is a qualified 501(c)3 nonprofit association so all donations are tax-deductible.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>We're very proud and excited that this will be our 6th year of providing the workshop to young people. This is due to the commitment and generosity of individuals, local organizations, returning graduates, talented guest educators, assistants and volunteers in Montana.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>SYVF has already helped over 100 young participants develop higher self-esteem, contribute to their community and become the best they can be. They have graduated from high school, gone on to be awarded college scholarships to Princeton, degrees at MSU, joined and performed in other community theatre groups, and generally succeed living their lives with a greater sense of happiness and solid self-concept. Many choose to return the following year as volunteers to champion the next group of participants.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>Through the unique mesh of the creative fields of writing, performance, music and film, participants from SYVF's summer outreach program are encouraged to unleash their creativity in a safe environment while improving self-esteem and developing strong, effective communication skills. They are guided to discover their own innate talents, cultivate a sense of pride and appreciate the importance of collaborating with others.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>To run the workshop a lot of careful preparation, team effort, commitment, skilled guest educators, dedicated volunteers and local support is required. It is made possible entirely through community and individual philanthropy. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""> </p>
<p>Your generous contribution to this IndieGogo campaign will enable us to ensure that each participant is given a full scholarship to attend the program and enjoy the benefits of a safe venue, access to talented guest educators, adequate supplies, qualified care and meals during the workshop plus help make the experience of recording a music track in a professional recording studio a reality.

The Share Your Voice Foundation's mission is simple.  We believe strongly in the transformative power of the arts to change lives and are dedicated to helping young people (primarily underprivileged teens in rural areas ages 13-17) transform their lives through powerful arts-based programs like the Empowerment through Performance (ETP) Workshop program. 
 
Thank you for watching our video (feel free to check out others on our vimeo page). It's been a remarkable journey thus far and we're so proud to still be going strong - changing the lives of a special group of young people each year, one summer at a time. 
 
SYVF serves these teens regardless of race, religion, creed, sex or socio-economic status.  We are committed to making a difference through the tremendous power of the arts by helping them find and share their voice to promote positive difference.
 
We ask for your support in making this vision come true in 2012.  It will not happen without your contribution. The workshop is being held July 16-20 with the final performance night for the community, 'Night at the Landing' being held at beautiful Stillwater Landing, 15 miles from Whitefish in Northwest Montana on Saturday, July 21.
 
Funds raised on IndieGoGo ensure we can run the 2012 workshop and also contribute to recording the song the participants write with a singer-songwriter during the workshop. 
 
SYVF is a qualified 501(c)3 nonprofit association so all donations are tax-deductible.
 
 
 
THE IMPACT
 
We're very proud and excited that this will be our 6th year of providing the workshop to young people. This is due to the commitment and generosity of individuals, local organizations, returning graduates, talented guest educators, assistants and volunteers in Montana.
 
SYVF has already helped over 100 young participants develop higher self-esteem, contribute to their community and become the best they can be. They have graduated from high school, gone on to be awarded college scholarships to Princeton, degrees at MSU, joined and performed in other community theatre groups, and generally succeed living their lives with a greater sense of happiness and solid self-concept. Many choose to return the following year as volunteers to champion the next group of participants.
 
Through the unique mesh of the creative fields of writing, performance, music and film, participants from SYVF's summer outreach program are encouraged to unleash their creativity in a safe environment while improving self-esteem and developing strong, effective communication skills. They are guided to discover their own innate talents, cultivate a sense of pride and appreciate the importance of collaborating with others.
 
 
 
WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
 
To run the workshop a lot of careful preparation, team effort, commitment, skilled guest educators, dedicated volunteers and local support is required. It is made possible entirely through community and individual philanthropy. 
 
Your generous contribution to this IndieGogo campaign will enable us to ensure that each participant is given a full scholarship to attend the program and enjoy the benefits of a safe venue, access to talented guest educators, adequate supplies, qualified care and meals during the workshop plus help make the experience of recording a music track in a professional recording studio a reality. Watch the clip from a previous year for the beautiful song, Love Is The Bridge To Peace.
 
Our donors are offered a number of benefits for sponsorship, from VIP access to the gala event night, t-shirts, recognition in media and photo opportunities with the graduates. Read the perks and get involved!
 
 
 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
 
PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!  You can make a huge difference by involving others.  Please tell all your friends and family about our IndieGoGo campaign and share the donation page link on facebook, google, twitter and via email. This really helps us get the word out - the more hits - the higher our profile.
 
BECOME A VOLUNTEER!  If you are located in the Flathead Valley in Northwest Montana, consider volunteering during the 5-day workshop, or helping out on the final performance night. We need all the help we can get to make the experience the best it can be for our young participants and it's a great way to meet other creative, service-minded folk and members of the community. Contact us via our website.
 
DONATE ITEMS!  If you live elsewhere but have access to 'goods and services' or wish to donate in this way, please consider donating to the 2012 workshop.
 
With 25 participants involved in the workshop we need:  25 CARRY BAGS, 25 WATER BOTTLES, 25 PENS, 25 MARKERS, 25 HIGHLIGHTER PENS, 25 NOTEBOOKS & BLANK CDS/DVDs.

<p><strong>Frederick is a good man who has gone through tremendous struggles in his life but has never given up hope. At a young age he was physically, emotionally, and sexually abused.

<p>THE CAMPAIGN: </p>
<p>Frederick is battling two forms of cancer. He was diagnosed with Renal cell carcinoma ( stage 2) in November 2011. In order to save his life, he had surgery to stop the bleeding only to find out the same cancer reoccurred after 5 months. In August 2012, Frederick went under the knife again to remove the kidney cancer but this time, his doctor discovered that the cancer had now spread to his liver.  The doctors removed the tumor from the liver also and started aggressive chemo and kidney dialysis. He now receives 4 dialysis per week , 3 chemo therapy per week and takes numerous antibiotics and medications to prevent from further spread to the other organs.. His body is convulsing from this illness everyday. His will to live is what gives him the power to wake up every morning. His days are spent from 8 AM to 2PM in getting this treatments. His faith is what keeps him alive and hopeful.  He has NO insurance and depends on help from friends and family but that too is beginning to phase out. Their resources has been exhausted. This is coming to halt almost immediately. You are his last resort. </p>
<p>Please allow Frederick to live... give him the the gift of life. He says if God will extend his life, he will spend his remaining days continuing to do God's work by helping substance abuse victims and spending quality time with his son.</p>

<p>Your donation how little or how large will be used almost immediately to finance his chemo and dialysis and medications. He has no money and living from hands to mouth. Sometimes, he skips days without dialysis and chemo. This action is dangerous as his cancers will advance to next stage and his kidney may fail and the result can be fatal. </p>

<p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common, aggressive, and lethal adult brain cancer, and is currently largely untreatable. This terrible disease, which affects 75,000 new patients worldwide each year (and took the life of the late Senator Edward Kennedy) is almost 100% fatal within 2 years of diagnosis, and many patients do not survive beyond 6 months from diagnosis.  GBM is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death among those 20-29 years in age.</p>
<h3>WHAT TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE?</h3>
<p>At present, the only approved drug for treating newly-diagnosed GBM is a chemotherapeutic that creates DNA damage leading to cancer cell death. Unfortunately, the benefit of this drug is short-lived, because DNA damage repair mechanisms -- that are overactive in GBM cells -- undue and repair the damage created by the drug.  Despite this, nearly all patients continue to receive this chemotherapeutic by default.  We need to move away for the current one-drug-fits-all approach, to a modern approach of tailoring treatment options to a particular patient's tumor (""personalized medicine"").</p>
<h3>HOW CAN WE IMPROVE THE ODDS?</h3>
<p>There is a pressing, unmet need for better diagnostic tests to help identify and predict which GBM patients may most benefit from alternative therapy options, including combination therapy with chemotherapeutic plus DNA damage repair inhibition, and highly targeted inhibitors in clinical trials for GBM.  Such tests will help  bring personalized medicince to the underserved GBM patient population.</p>

</center>
<p>Just a few years ago, four strangers, all of them new to the scene, arrived at Lakes of Fire (a regional Burning Man event).  Each of them expected to have a good time, what they didn’t expect was to have their lives changed.  Over the course of a few days, these four strangers bonded for life with a new understanding of self, community and love.  For the first time in a long time, they allowed themselves to become the real them and wanted to share this with everyone!   A few months later, the small group had grown to 20 strong. </p>
<p>Today, we’re at 83 members; we are creative, we are doers, we are BURNERS! </p>
<p>We practice the 10 Guiding Principles of a Burner:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Radical Inclusion</strong> – Anyone can be a part of CATAWAMPUS.   We welcome the stranger.  No perquisites exist for participation in our community.</li>
<li>
<strong>Gifting</strong> – CATAWAMPUS is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.</li>
<li>
<strong>Decommodification</strong> – In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising.  We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.</li>
<li>
<strong>Radical Self-reliance</strong> – CATAWAMPUS encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.</li>
<li>
<strong>Radical Self-expression</strong> – Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others.  In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.</li>
<li>
<strong>Communal Effort</strong> - CATAWAMPUS values creative cooperation and collaboration.  We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.</li>
<li>
<strong>Civic Responsibility</strong> – We value civil society. Catawampi who organize events assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants.  They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.</li>
<li>
<strong>Leaving No Trace</strong> – CATAWAMPUS respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather.  We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Participation</strong> – CATAWAMPUS is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing.  Everyone is invited to work.  Everyone is invited to play.  We make the world real through actions that open the heart.</li>
<li>
<strong>Immediacy</strong> – Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers.  No idea can substitute for this experience.</li>
</ul><h3>What We Need</h3>

<p>One of the main goals for CATAWAMPUS is enlightening others to the Burner lifestyle.  We do this by make life-changing experiences available to as many people as possible for as cheaply as possible.  A cornerstone in helping to make this happen is using our bus for transportation!  That’s where you come in; we need you!</p>
<div>
<p>We’re now on bus II (bus I met an untimely demise).  Bus II, the sequel, needs some major work in order to get it ready to meet the needs of group. We have two areas where we must focus:</p>
<ol>
<li>Repairs – We recently took the bus in for a DOT inspection.  The following issues were found.<ol>
<li>Tie Rod ends must be replaced (Completed).</li>
<li>Wheel Seals must be replaced.</li>
<li>Pinion Seal and Gear Oil must be replaced.</li>
<li>Axle Pins, Shackles and Hangers must be replaced.</li>
<li>Torque Leaf Pins and Bushings must be replaced.</li>
<li>Requires transmission and engine check (due to seepage).</li>
<li>Possible transmission work needed (determined by #f)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Construction – In order to meet Michigan (and other states) standards (for retitling, allowing regular Driver License holders to drive), we must add the following.<ol>
<li>A food preparation area.  This involves plumbing for fresh and gray water, cooking/heating source and refrigeration.</li>
<li>A restroom area.  This also involves construction and plumbing.</li>
<li>Independent electrical / heating system.  Uhhhh… this involves a lot (including installation of a second alternator)! </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We currently estimate all repairs and construction needs to be approximately <strong>$11,000.00</strong> (ouch!!)</p>

</div></div>","Camp CATAWAMPUS

   

Just a few years ago, four strangers, all of them new to the scene, arrived at Lakes of Fire (a regional Burning Man event).  Each of them expected to have a good time, what they didn’t expect was to have their lives changed.  Over the course of a few days, these four strangers bonded for life with a new understanding of self, community and love.  For the first time in a long time, they allowed themselves to become the real them and wanted to share this with everyone!   A few months later, the small group had grown to 20 strong. 
Today, we’re at 83 members; we are creative, we are doers, we are BURNERS! 
We practice the 10 Guiding Principles of a Burner:


Radical Inclusion – Anyone can be a part of CATAWAMPUS.   We welcome the stranger.  No perquisites exist for participation in our community.

Gifting – CATAWAMPUS is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.

Decommodification – In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising.  We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.

Radical Self-reliance – CATAWAMPUS encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.

Radical Self-expression – Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others.  In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.

Communal Effort - CATAWAMPUS values creative cooperation and collaboration.  We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.

Civic Responsibility – We value civil society. Catawampi who organize events assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants.  They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.

Leaving No Trace – CATAWAMPUS respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather.  We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.

Participation – CATAWAMPUS is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing.  Everyone is invited to work.  Everyone is invited to play.  We make the world real through actions that open the heart.

Immediacy – Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers.  No idea can substitute for this experience.
What We Need



One of the main goals for CATAWAMPUS is enlightening others to the Burner lifestyle.  We do this by make life-changing experiences available to as many people as possible for as cheaply as possible.  A cornerstone in helping to make this happen is using our bus for transportation!  That’s where you come in; we need you!

We’re now on bus II (bus I met an untimely demise).  Bus II, the sequel, needs some major work in order to get it ready to meet the needs of group. We have two areas where we must focus:

Repairs – We recently took the bus in for a DOT inspection.  The following issues were found.
Tie Rod ends must be replaced (Completed).
Wheel Seals must be replaced.
Pinion Seal and Gear Oil must be replaced.
Axle Pins, Shackles and Hangers must be replaced.
Torque Leaf Pins and Bushings must be replaced.
Requires transmission and engine check (due to seepage).
Possible transmission work needed (determined by #f)


Construction – In order to meet Michigan (and other states) standards (for retitling, allowing regular Driver License holders to drive), we must add the following.
A food preparation area.  This involves plumbing for fresh and gray water, cooking/heating source and refrigeration.
A restroom area.  This also involves construction and plumbing.
Independent electrical / heating system.  Uhhhh… this involves a lot (including installation of a second alternator)! 



We currently estimate all repairs and construction needs to be approximately $11,000.00 (ouch!!)


What Your Help Means

        

Our group is amazing!!!  It may be that you’ve participated with us before or perhaps you will in the future but, either way, you’ll find that we are open, real and caring.  We care about our community and the individuals around us.  Helping us to reach our goal is one of many ways to support your community and make impacting changes in the lives of others!
Other Ways You Can Help

      

Maybe you’re not presently financially able to help us with monetary support.  No problem.  Here are a few additional ways to support us.

SHARE – Share about us on every social media possible and make a recommendation to ALL of your friends.
JOIN – Join us at one of our many workdays or fundraising events.
GIVE – Do you have any construction materials around that are in good shape, but are no longer needed?  We could probably use them!!!

Thank you for taking time to stop by and find out more about my field work experience in Ghana. I sincerely appreciate the love. 





I will be interning for the Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana (PPAG) in Cape Coast from January - May 2012. I am excited for this opportunity, as it encompasses many things that I am passionate about: sexual and reproductive health; activism; community outreach; and education. I believe the cultural experience that I am about to embark on will be life changing.

What I Am Asking For 

Currently, I am in the stages of addressing the logistics of this experience and it is an exciting yet stressful process because it draws me nearer to Ghana. As you can imagine, this opportunity is going to be quite costly. 

As an unpaid internship, I will receive academic credit that is required for the completion of my undergraduate degree. However, I am responsible for airfare, immunizations, securing a visa, travel insurance, and a program fee that covers my lodging, food (breakfast and dinner), and local transportation. As a non-governmental organization in a developing nation, the Planned Parenthood of Ghana relies on resources such as donations and interns, like myself, and therefore cannot support the expenses associated with this experience.  
While I have applied for a scholarship and am working full-time, there is still an economic disparity that I need to address. Below I have listed quotes for some the expenses I am referring to:
Program Fees - $2,200 (lodging, food and transportation for 4 months)

<p>This person could be selected to attend a 10-Day Yoga Retreat with all expenses paid!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The ""WHY""</h3></span><p></p><p>Our project is important to us not because it is about Yoga, but because it is about helping people transform, find true joy within so that when they return home to their communities, they can set an example that others can emulate.  As Gandhi said - ""Be the change you wish to see in the world"".</p><p> We believe that when you touch someone's heart and soul, you will forever change their lives and positively impact the world beginning with those around them. It creates a ripple of love that radiates from within and that is the truth we want those who join us on these Retreats to experience for themselves so they can share this with their own communities.</p><p>Being a contributor to this project will help us create an unbelievable experience for individuals who otherwise would never have the opportunity at immersing themselves in the the rich culture and community in India. This isn't a simple tour of India… participants have the opportunity for some incredible experiences: washing hands in the holy pristine waters of the Ganges at the foothills of the Himalayas, doing Yoga in Rishikesh (the ""birthplace"" of Yoga), meditating with Monks at a famous Monastery near the Himalayas, and soaking in the energy under the Bodhi tree where Buddha attained enlightenment. All of this while learning to tune into the senses of their body with the foods they eat in a Mindful Eating exercise, taking control of their Breath with techniques (Pranayama) from a renowned Ayurvedic doctor in India, and recording their innermost thoughts and reflections in a personalized journal handmade from natural banana fibers.</p><p>Please, if you know someone who has touched you deeply, has an incredible story, is an inspiring Yoga instructor or holistic healer and you think they would be an incredible candidate for this opportunity, we want you to nominate this person above and we will be selecting a few of these candidates to join us for free on this Retreat to be a part of this life changing experience. :)</p><p></p><h3>What is Joyful Breath Yoga?</h3><p>Simply, Joyful Breath Yoga is a Virtual Online Yoga studio that empowers teachers around the world to globally share their gifts, passions, and unique practice of Yoga.</p><p>When we started the Joyful Breath Yoga project, we envisioned making a huge impact in the communities we serve and the world. Our mission statement includes 'empowering our students to find their inner joy'. We want to live and embody this message, not simply have it as a tagline. :) </p><p>All of us that are part of this project have put our entire heart and soul into this which is why for our inaugural Retreat this year in India we want to give some incredible individuals the opportunity of a lifetime to take a life changing trip to transform their lives physically, mentally and spiritually and use the energy to change the world around them!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where are funds going?</h3><p>We feel we need at least $6000 to make this possible for two remarkable people based on these expenses:</p><ul>
<li>$1500 per person for flights to India</li>
<li>$10/day per person for food, $40/day for transport, $100/day for lodging ($1500 total)</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So with $6000, we could comfortably afford to take 2 people, but if we get more incredibly inspiring stories, we will use extra funds from paying attendees of the Retreat to offset these costs :)</span></li>
</ul><p></p><h3>What can benefactors of this campaign expect?</h3>We are deeply grateful to anyone who decides to contribute even a small amount to this campaign. We will involve all contributors who give at least $10 to this Retreat with a special memorabilia from this experience in art form mailed directly to their home address. This will be a surprise because it involves a special group activity that will be taking place during this Retreat, but we feel it is so special and will be so highly energetic, we want to share this energy with everyone who has decided to contribute even a little to make this experience possible for those need it or who could make the most impact in their communities. <p></p><p></p><p>Along with this special gift, contributors at $25 will receive a special Journey of Joy embroidered handmade journal made of banana fibers.</p><p></p><p>Contributors at $50 will receive this journal and a special handmade Yoga Bag made from recycled silk material. </p><p>Contributors at $100 will receive this journal and bag along with a special Yoga mat crafted from the fibers of the Jute tree! A completely handcrafted mat designed with each individual in mind and embroidered with your name on it. It will be a limited edition Journey of Joy mat that will keep the memory and impact of this Retreat rooted in your heart and soul forever. </p><p>Contributors at $250 will receive all of the above plus a special, private 1-hour Yoga session with Debra OBryan, founder of the Joyful Breath Yoga project, virtually through our website. Work through any issues you have, focus on any aspect of Yoga you want, and get tips on Mindful Eating based on your lifestyle and blood type.  </p><p>Contributors at $500 will get all of the above and exclusive access to participate virtually during many of the group activities LIVE during the Retreat in India! Join us from the comfort of your home while we share your energy at these places in India and fully immerse you in the experience as it is taking place. We will also have these group sessions and workshops recorded for you to view later.</p><p>At $2500, you will receive all the above and can send someone specifically who you think would be transformed by this experience on the Retreat.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>We are attempting to bring individuals who truly deserve a Retreat like this because we believe we can make a deep impact in the hearts of those this project touches and continue to do this for the years to come. When you contribute to this project, you are also investing in the long-term commitment from all of us involved to continue to bring this experience to those who most need it. We see this Retreat empowering:</p><ul>
<li>Those in lower socio-economic situations.</li>
<li>Individuals who have overcome numerous challenges in life and deserve an experience to brighten their inner light.</li>
<li>Yoga instructors who are already creating unbelievable change in their communities but have never had the financial means to visit the birthplace of Yoga and immerse themselves in the culture and traditions of a country which has already touched their hearts. </li>

This person could be selected to attend a 10-Day Yoga Retreat with all expenses paid!

The ""WHY""Our project is important to us not because it is about Yoga, but because it is about helping people transform, find true joy within so that when they return home to their communities, they can set an example that others can emulate.  As Gandhi said - ""Be the change you wish to see in the world"". We believe that when you touch someone's heart and soul, you will forever change their lives and positively impact the world beginning with those around them. It creates a ripple of love that radiates from within and that is the truth we want those who join us on these Retreats to experience for themselves so they can share this with their own communities.Being a contributor to this project will help us create an unbelievable experience for individuals who otherwise would never have the opportunity at immersing themselves in the the rich culture and community in India. This isn't a simple tour of India… participants have the opportunity for some incredible experiences: washing hands in the holy pristine waters of the Ganges at the foothills of the Himalayas, doing Yoga in Rishikesh (the ""birthplace"" of Yoga), meditating with Monks at a famous Monastery near the Himalayas, and soaking in the energy under the Bodhi tree where Buddha attained enlightenment. All of this while learning to tune into the senses of their body with the foods they eat in a Mindful Eating exercise, taking control of their Breath with techniques (Pranayama) from a renowned Ayurvedic doctor in India, and recording their innermost thoughts and reflections in a personalized journal handmade from natural banana fibers.Please, if you know someone who has touched you deeply, has an incredible story, is an inspiring Yoga instructor or holistic healer and you think they would be an incredible candidate for this opportunity, we want you to nominate this person above and we will be selecting a few of these candidates to join us for free on this Retreat to be a part of this life changing experience. :)What is Joyful Breath Yoga?Simply, Joyful Breath Yoga is a Virtual Online Yoga studio that empowers teachers around the world to globally share their gifts, passions, and unique practice of Yoga.When we started the Joyful Breath Yoga project, we envisioned making a huge impact in the communities we serve and the world. Our mission statement includes 'empowering our students to find their inner joy'. We want to live and embody this message, not simply have it as a tagline. :) All of us that are part of this project have put our entire heart and soul into this which is why for our inaugural Retreat this year in India we want to give some incredible individuals the opportunity of a lifetime to take a life changing trip to transform their lives physically, mentally and spiritually and use the energy to change the world around them!Where are funds going?We feel we need at least $6000 to make this possible for two remarkable people based on these expenses:
$1500 per person for flights to India
$10/day per person for food, $40/day for transport, $100/day for lodging ($1500 total)
So with $6000, we could comfortably afford to take 2 people, but if we get more incredibly inspiring stories, we will use extra funds from paying attendees of the Retreat to offset these costs :)
What can benefactors of this campaign expect?We are deeply grateful to anyone who decides to contribute even a small amount to this campaign. We will involve all contributors who give at least $10 to this Retreat with a special memorabilia from this experience in art form mailed directly to their home address. This will be a surprise because it involves a special group activity that will be taking place during this Retreat, but we feel it is so special and will be so highly energetic, we want to share this energy with everyone who has decided to contribute even a little to make this experience possible for those need it or who could make the most impact in their communities. Along with this special gift, contributors at $25 will receive a special Journey of Joy embroidered handmade journal made of banana fibers.Contributors at $50 will receive this journal and a special handmade Yoga Bag made from recycled silk material. Contributors at $100 will receive this journal and bag along with a special Yoga mat crafted from the fibers of the Jute tree! A completely handcrafted mat designed with each individual in mind and embroidered with your name on it. It will be a limited edition Journey of Joy mat that will keep the memory and impact of this Retreat rooted in your heart and soul forever. Contributors at $250 will receive all of the above plus a special, private 1-hour Yoga session with Debra OBryan, founder of the Joyful Breath Yoga project, virtually through our website. Work through any issues you have, focus on any aspect of Yoga you want, and get tips on Mindful Eating based on your lifestyle and blood type.  Contributors at $500 will get all of the above and exclusive access to participate virtually during many of the group activities LIVE during the Retreat in India! Join us from the comfort of your home while we share your energy at these places in India and fully immerse you in the experience as it is taking place. We will also have these group sessions and workshops recorded for you to view later.At $2500, you will receive all the above and can send someone specifically who you think would be transformed by this experience on the Retreat.The ImpactWe are attempting to bring individuals who truly deserve a Retreat like this because we believe we can make a deep impact in the hearts of those this project touches and continue to do this for the years to come. When you contribute to this project, you are also investing in the long-term commitment from all of us involved to continue to bring this experience to those who most need it. We see this Retreat empowering:
Those in lower socio-economic situations.
Individuals who have overcome numerous challenges in life and deserve an experience to brighten their inner light.
Yoga instructors who are already creating unbelievable change in their communities but have never had the financial means to visit the birthplace of Yoga and immerse themselves in the culture and traditions of a country which has already touched their hearts.

Debra O'Bryan is a renowned Yoga instructor from the Midwest in Lees Summit, MO. She has been featured on numerous media outlets including NBC, has brought yoga to large school districts and big corporations, and is the official Yoga instructor of the Kansas City Chiefs Football team.

She sees the beauty in helping individuals overcome physical obstacles such as being wheelchair bound to fully participate in a flowing Yoga class. The energy behind the Joyful Breath Yoga project originates from Debra's vision and passion in helping people see the world through their own inner light and greatness. These Retreats will be an extension of this energy that Debra brings out into the world. Watch and hear from Debra on her vision for creating Joyful Breath Yoga:Help Change the WorldIf you are unable to monetarily contribute to this project, just nominate someone who can transform their lives or those of others.  We want to impact the lives of people who can truly benefit from the experiences provided by this Retreat.

</div>
<p>Tooth decay has a severe burden on
billions of impoverished people around the world. They can’t always afford
preventative dental care, but they can afford and enjoy our tasty Xylitol Chewing Gum, which is scientifically proven to fight cavity-causing bacteria in
the mouth. We’re committed to creating a sweet solution for this bitter
problem. </p><p>We've reached our goal thanks to almost 200 funders! The more we raise, the more people we can employ, the more kids we can distribute dentally beneficial gum and information to. The $15,000 funding goal sustains our project for the next two months. With your support, we could <b>sustain</b> <i>and</i> <b>scale</b> Sweet Bites for many months more. Let's exceed expectations! Break the dental burden bubble.</p><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/736430/files/20140722140120-2H9A6332.JPG?1406062880"" src="""" style=""width: 621px; height: 414px;""/></p>
<p>The <a href=""www.sweetbitesgum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sweet Bites</a> team is made up of 5
best friends from the University of Pennsylvania. We launched this project in Bangalore, India. Every day, our team distributes the gum to
children in primary schools, many of whom live in slums and have very little
access to healthcare. The kids especially love our fruity banana flavor!</p><p>Unfortunately, we had to say our (temporary) goodbyes to Bangalore and are back in our Boston office. Now, we need your help to sustain and scale the Sweet Bites project until we can raise enough money to return to India in the fall. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">If
Sweet Bites is a success in Bangalore, it’s just a matter of time until we’re
saving smiles around the whole country, and then the world.</span></p><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>The funds raised here will go directly into sustainably scaling our
project in Bangalore over the next two months and beyond. We've met our fundraising goal! We're ecstatic, because this means the 25,000 pieces of Sweet Bites gum distributed to date will quadruple to 100,000 pieces distributed in the next two months, a big step towards achieving our target impact of <b>1 million children</b> chewing Sweet Bites in the new year.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Thanks to our generous funders, we've already sent our teammate Thoba back to India! Right now, he is meeting with strategic partners, sponsors, and new Bangalore team members to start scaling. With your continued support, we will send Eric back in early September! </span></p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, we will be able to make the initial investment for the factory we are planning to build outside of Bangalore. We already have deals lined up for the land, equipment, and raw materials - it's just a matter of funding and getting Eric on the ground. Local production will drive our costs down, and enable us to keep the gum affordable for children. </p>

<h3><b>This is Your Only Chance to Try the Gum</b></h3>
<p>We’re offering quite a few perks but most important to note is
that this IndieGogo campaign is the ONLY way to buy Sweet Bites online.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><b>Dental Health</b></div> <p></p>
<p>Sweet Bites contains 20 times more
xylitol per piece than the competitors in India, yet we offer it at
competitive prices at small corner stores in underserved communities. The science
recommends chewing 3 – 5 grams of xylitol gum per day, which can easily be done by having a piece of Sweet Bites after
meals.</p>
<p><b>Education</b></p>
<p>Moreover, we include health messaging
on the wrapper so each piece reinforces important behaviors, like brushing
twice a day.</p>
<p><b>Employment</b></p>
<p>Lastly, Sweet Bites is providing
meaningful, part-time employment to local students because we want our product
to be distributed by people who deeply understand their community’s culture and
needs.</p>

<p>Our company was recently listed as the #1 Simple Invention

sweetener and the gum has been scientifically proven and FDA
approved for decades, so it’s a bit of a stretch to say we “invented” it. Our innovation is in our model - providing the highest dose of Xylitol at the lowest cost to people who need it most.)</p>
<p>Back in March, our team was selected as one of six finalists out
of 11,000 university applicants for the $1,000,000 <a href=""http://www.hultprize.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hult Prize for social entrepreneurship</a>. The funds we raise here will keep our project’s momentum

<h3>Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Public health problems are never easy to solve, and the
developing world is littered with the skeletons of failed foreign interventions
and technological innovations. A healthcare professor at Penn once warned us
about the dangers of working in the slums: </p>

that people already know and love; we hope to overcome these challenges. Education is a
key aspect of our vision; Sweet Bites is just as much about distributing gum as
it is about empowering local students to do meaningful work and providing important health information to underserved children.</p>

<p>This campaign is about much more than the fundraising. According
to WHO statistics, oral disease has a more severe burden on the population than
leukemia, breast cancer, and heart disease (just to name a few). Yet, it’s too often
overlooked. There are many ways to help. You don’t have to contribute your
money; we deeply appreciate anyone who contributes their voice. Spread the word!</p><h3>Win 500 Free Pieces of Your Favorite Flavor!</h3><p>We're rewarding the person that wins us the most support!

billions of impoverished people around the world. They can’t always afford
preventative dental care, but they can afford and enjoy our tasty Xylitol Chewing Gum, which is scientifically proven to fight cavity-causing bacteria in
the mouth. We’re committed to creating a sweet solution for this bitter
problem. We've reached our goal thanks to almost 200 funders! The more we raise, the more people we can employ, the more kids we can distribute dentally beneficial gum and information to. The $15,000 funding goal sustains our project for the next two months. With your support, we could sustain and scale Sweet Bites for many months more. Let's exceed expectations! Break the dental burden bubble.

The Sweet Bites team is made up of 5
best friends from the University of Pennsylvania. We launched this project in Bangalore, India. Every day, our team distributes the gum to
children in primary schools, many of whom live in slums and have very little
access to healthcare. The kids especially love our fruity banana flavor!Unfortunately, we had to say our (temporary) goodbyes to Bangalore and are back in our Boston office. Now, we need your help to sustain and scale the Sweet Bites project until we can raise enough money to return to India in the fall. If
Sweet Bites is a success in Bangalore, it’s just a matter of time until we’re
saving smiles around the whole country, and then the world.
What We Need & What You Get 
The funds raised here will go directly into sustainably scaling our
project in Bangalore over the next two months and beyond. We've met our fundraising goal! We're ecstatic, because this means the 25,000 pieces of Sweet Bites gum distributed to date will quadruple to 100,000 pieces distributed in the next two months, a big step towards achieving our target impact of 1 million children chewing Sweet Bites in the new year.
Thanks to our generous funders, we've already sent our teammate Thoba back to India! Right now, he is meeting with strategic partners, sponsors, and new Bangalore team members to start scaling. With your continued support, we will send Eric back in early September! 
If we exceed our goal, we will be able to make the initial investment for the factory we are planning to build outside of Bangalore. We already have deals lined up for the land, equipment, and raw materials - it's just a matter of funding and getting Eric on the ground. Local production will drive our costs down, and enable us to keep the gum affordable for children. 


This is Your Only Chance to Try the Gum
We’re offering quite a few perks but most important to note is
that this IndieGogo campaign is the ONLY way to buy Sweet Bites online.
  The Impact
Dental Health 
Sweet Bites contains 20 times more
xylitol per piece than the competitors in India, yet we offer it at
competitive prices at small corner stores in underserved communities. The science
recommends chewing 3 – 5 grams of xylitol gum per day, which can easily be done by having a piece of Sweet Bites after
meals.
Education
Moreover, we include health messaging
on the wrapper so each piece reinforces important behaviors, like brushing
twice a day.
Employment
Lastly, Sweet Bites is providing
meaningful, part-time employment to local students because we want our product
to be distributed by people who deeply understand their community’s culture and
needs.
Fight Tooth Decay. Educate Children. Empower Students.


Our company was recently listed as the #1 Simple Invention
Changing the World on the Huffington Post. (Actually, Xylitol is a natural
sweetener and the gum has been scientifically proven and FDA
approved for decades, so it’s a bit of a stretch to say we “invented” it. Our innovation is in our model - providing the highest dose of Xylitol at the lowest cost to people who need it most.)
Back in March, our team was selected as one of six finalists out
of 11,000 university applicants for the $1,000,000 Hult Prize for social entrepreneurship. The funds we raise here will keep our project’s momentum
growing until the finals in September when we pitch at the Clinton Global
Initiative, a major global health conference.

Challenges  
Public health problems are never easy to solve, and the
developing world is littered with the skeletons of failed foreign interventions
and technological innovations. A healthcare professor at Penn once warned us
about the dangers of working in the slums: 
When it comes medicine, free is not
cheap enough.
By delivering our health solution in a tasty, inexpensive treat
that people already know and love; we hope to overcome these challenges. Education is a
key aspect of our vision; Sweet Bites is just as much about distributing gum as
it is about empowering local students to do meaningful work and providing important health information to underserved children.
  Other Ways You Can Help 

This campaign is about much more than the fundraising. According
to WHO statistics, oral disease has a more severe burden on the population than
leukemia, breast cancer, and heart disease (just to name a few). Yet, it’s too often
overlooked. There are many ways to help. You don’t have to contribute your
money; we deeply appreciate anyone who contributes their voice. Spread the word!Win 500 Free Pieces of Your Favorite Flavor!We're rewarding the person that wins us the most support! If you're logged into an Indiegogo account and you share our campaign using the Indiegogo links (twitter, email, etc); we'll get to see how much funds were raised because of YOUR help sharing the project! At the end of the campaign, we'll count up who was the best at spreading the word and hook them up with free gum.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Transform Health Care</span></p>
<p>Hello! Thanks for checking out Karisha. We are <a href=""#anchor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">doctors and health professionals,</a> and we're ready to transform health care for all.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Once funded</i></b>, <span><br/></span>we can create our vision of Karisha Community, which includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>a medical clinic offering acute, chronic, and walk-in care</li>
<li>a teaching kitchen</li>
<li>a yoga space</li>
<li>a physical therapy area</li>
<li>a networking space with wifi</li>
<li>beautiful and edible gardens</li>
<li>a physical therapy and healing arts studio</li>
<li>and more </li>
</ul>
<p>Karisha Community will be an integrative food, 
medicine and well-being space, for all. Karisha represents a new culture of
 health care, delivered in a nurturing environment where patients love to get care and where providers love to work. In time it will serve as a vehicle to transform health care in Central Texas and the US.</p>
<p>As Karisha providers, we listen intently, then individualize health care to the patient’s goals, their health needs, their prefered modality to receive care, and their background. We care for acute and chronic illness as indicated, while also supplementing the body’s innate capacity to heal. For those free of disease and those gaining freedom from it, we illuminate the path to well-being:  health for the body, calm for the mind, and bliss for the spirit. </p>
<p>This is Karisha, a new culture of health care.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How this Campaign Helps Karisha (and You!)</span></h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>Let me be clear: if we don't raise $25,000, all the money is returned to the donors. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Hi there, I'm Amina. I'm a doctor, and I'm ready to transform health care.</p>
<p>After life changing events in our family -- the loss of my dear sister Priya Haji, the gain of her two angels Zen (2) and Omi (1), and the loss of my dear cousin brother Nasiru -- I decided to depart from my urgent care position with Baylor Scott &amp; White and pursue my professional dream. </p>
<p>I truly believe in the power of this community. I know we can raise the money, and if we don't, we give it back, and Karisha stagnates. </p>
<p>But let's think positively. We'll raise the $25,000 and MORE! </p>
<p>Because as you can guess, it takes much more than 25k to start a health clinic and center. </p>
<p>So what will this money be used for? Great question. </p>
<p>Your donation takes Karisha from idea to reality. Karisha is a concept that everyone loves, but how to make it a reality is the challenge... and that's our work. The money we raise goes toward research for best practices, collaborations with similar centers across the US, and creating the financial model. </p>
<p>If you live in Austin, the $25,000 helps us secure a site for the Karisha Community integrative health center in Austin. </p>
<p>If you are a person or provider elsewhere in the US, or anywhere in the world, this $25,000 gets you closer to having a blueprint in your hand that allows you to create a Karisha Community in your town . . . one step closer to creating a space that bridges food, medicine, and health, that delivers patient centered care with brilliant minds and tender hearts . . . one step closer to transforming health care.</p>

<p>And furthermore, the name ""Karisha"" comes from my parents - Karim and Asha Haji. (Kari + sha) They taught me the art, humanity, and service of medicine. I had the privilege of watching them create an amazing economically and ethnically diverse medical practice in Bryan with a free medical clinic that continues to be my inspiration for what I want to do today.</p>
<p>I wish to take their work to the next level. </p>

<div>Our current health care system fails to address fundamental elements of health: <br/>
</div> <p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the food we eat</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">stress reduction</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">exercise</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">social supports</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">restorative sleep</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">mind-body practices</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and more.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We live in busy times, with packed schedules, little time to prepare food and high stress. Self care and preventative aspects of healthful living are not facilitated by our current health care system, culture, or food industry. For those who struggle to pay bills, these aspects of healthy living are even harder to come by.</span><br/><br/>At Karisha Community, we teach people how to care for themselves, where self-care becomes the basis of preventive health. We offer services to nurture self care, which translates to care of our families, children, and community at our center for food, medicine and well-being for all.<br/><p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Worthwhile Risk</h3> <p>I've been researching and visiting with integrative health centers for over 10 years, and I understand the inherent risk in this model.</p>
<p>Karisha Community values:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">creating healing spaces that are truly nourishing for staff and patients</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">maintaining a clear work - life balance for practitioners </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">working with the entire spectrum of health services - from intervention to maintenance to prevention</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">serving all clients, regardless of ability to pay</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">practioners working together in the same practice, rather than renting space</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">a physical center which houses the spaces and practitioners, providing choice and ease for patients, allowing for enhanced collaboration among providers</span><br/></span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><i>All of these components translate into higher start up and operational cost.<span><br/></span></i></p>
<p>And Karisha believes in these components because without a doubt, they result in a higher quality of service and health for the patients and the staff. We believe and will ultimately show that this model decreases costs to our health care system. By empowering patients to take care of themselves, we decrease the burden of chronic disease, we can reverse diabetes and hypertension; we can prevent hospitalizations. By staying accessible financially and though our hours of operation, we decrease emergency room visits. By partnering with patients and facilitating self care as the basis of preventive of preventive health, we ultimately save costs to our far too expensive health care system.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are successful models for this type of center and clinic. The one closest to my heart is the clinic started in Bryan, TX, which was started by my family. Health for All has been in flourishing since 1985. It serves approximately 5000 patients today and is now affiliated with the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center Medical School so that doctors in training receive experience in providing underserved care. I had the privilege of watching the ins and outs of an amazing economically and ethnically diverse medical practice with a free medical clinic that works with people of all backgrounds, cultures, and socioeconomic status. At Karisha, I will utilize the best practices observed, creating a financial model where those who have resources to pay, receive great care and make it possible for those with fewer resources to get the same great care just by coming to our beautiful center. </p>
<p><b><a name=""anchor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We also have the incredible advantage to ALREADY have a team of providers in place. I cannot say enough about the collective power and wisdom these skilled providers bring to the Karisha Community.</a> </b></p>

</div></div>","Transform Health Care
Hello! Thanks for checking out Karisha. We are doctors and health professionals, and we're ready to transform health care for all.

Once funded, we can create our vision of Karisha Community, which includes: 

a medical clinic offering acute, chronic, and walk-in care
a teaching kitchen
a yoga space
a physical therapy area
a networking space with wifi
beautiful and edible gardens
a physical therapy and healing arts studio
and more 

Karisha Community will be an integrative food, 
medicine and well-being space, for all. Karisha represents a new culture of
 health care, delivered in a nurturing environment where patients love to get care and where providers love to work. In time it will serve as a vehicle to transform health care in Central Texas and the US.
As Karisha providers, we listen intently, then individualize health care to the patient’s goals, their health needs, their prefered modality to receive care, and their background. We care for acute and chronic illness as indicated, while also supplementing the body’s innate capacity to heal. For those free of disease and those gaining freedom from it, we illuminate the path to well-being:  health for the body, calm for the mind, and bliss for the spirit. 
This is Karisha, a new culture of health care.
   How this Campaign Helps Karisha (and You!)


Let me be clear: if we don't raise $25,000, all the money is returned to the donors. 

Hi there, I'm Amina. I'm a doctor, and I'm ready to transform health care.
After life changing events in our family -- the loss of my dear sister Priya Haji, the gain of her two angels Zen (2) and Omi (1), and the loss of my dear cousin brother Nasiru -- I decided to depart from my urgent care position with Baylor Scott & White and pursue my professional dream. 
I truly believe in the power of this community. I know we can raise the money, and if we don't, we give it back, and Karisha stagnates. 
But let's think positively. We'll raise the $25,000 and MORE! 
Because as you can guess, it takes much more than 25k to start a health clinic and center. 
So what will this money be used for? Great question. 
Your donation takes Karisha from idea to reality. Karisha is a concept that everyone loves, but how to make it a reality is the challenge... and that's our work. The money we raise goes toward research for best practices, collaborations with similar centers across the US, and creating the financial model. 
If you live in Austin, the $25,000 helps us secure a site for the Karisha Community integrative health center in Austin. 
If you are a person or provider elsewhere in the US, or anywhere in the world, this $25,000 gets you closer to having a blueprint in your hand that allows you to create a Karisha Community in your town . . . one step closer to creating a space that bridges food, medicine, and health, that delivers patient centered care with brilliant minds and tender hearts . . . one step closer to transforming health care.


By contributing to our campaign at this stage, you are literally a co-creator of the Karisha Community. You are a Karisha 'good luck token' and you are a foundational part of this movement to transform health care. Beyond these initial uses of the money, we will take on the costs of:

Building a beautiful, welcoming medical clinic and healing center to industry standards and beyond


Implementing and training staff on innovative internet technology that allows you as a patient to connect to us, for us to support you, and so you can receive multiple forms of service with adequately monitored treatment plans


Hiring amazing providers and support staff from around the country who are excited to create a new model of care with us


Paying the providers a salary that is worthy of their expertise and skills
When is this all happening?We have a two year launch plan. The Karisha Center will bridge food, medicine and health by bringing medical providers, quality food, and healing practitioners under one roof in a community space. 
The center will house: 


a medical clinic offering acute, chronic, and walk-in care
a teaching kitchen
yoga space
physical therapy area
networking space with great wifi
beautiful and edible gardens

physical therapy and healing arts studio


and more 


It will be co-located with an integrative health and medical clinic, Karisha Health, that will provide acute, chronic and walk-in medical care to the community.
And furthermore, the name ""Karisha"" comes from my parents - Karim and Asha Haji. (Kari + sha) They taught me the art, humanity, and service of medicine. I had the privilege of watching them create an amazing economically and ethnically diverse medical practice in Bryan with a free medical clinic that continues to be my inspiration for what I want to do today.
I wish to take their work to the next level. 
   Karisha's Impact
Our current health care system fails to address fundamental elements of health: 
 

the food we eat
stress reduction
exercise
social supports
restorative sleep
mind-body practices
and more.

We live in busy times, with packed schedules, little time to prepare food and high stress. Self care and preventative aspects of healthful living are not facilitated by our current health care system, culture, or food industry. For those who struggle to pay bills, these aspects of healthy living are even harder to come by.At Karisha Community, we teach people how to care for themselves, where self-care becomes the basis of preventive health. We offer services to nurture self care, which translates to care of our families, children, and community at our center for food, medicine and well-being for all.

    The Worthwhile Risk I've been researching and visiting with integrative health centers for over 10 years, and I understand the inherent risk in this model.
Karisha Community values:



creating healing spaces that are truly nourishing for staff and patients


maintaining a clear work - life balance for practitioners 

working with the entire spectrum of health services - from intervention to maintenance to prevention

serving all clients, regardless of ability to pay

practioners working together in the same practice, rather than renting space
a physical center which houses the spaces and practitioners, providing choice and ease for patients, allowing for enhanced collaboration among providers


All of these components translate into higher start up and operational cost.
And Karisha believes in these components because without a doubt, they result in a higher quality of service and health for the patients and the staff. We believe and will ultimately show that this model decreases costs to our health care system. By empowering patients to take care of themselves, we decrease the burden of chronic disease, we can reverse diabetes and hypertension; we can prevent hospitalizations. By staying accessible financially and though our hours of operation, we decrease emergency room visits. By partnering with patients and facilitating self care as the basis of preventive of preventive health, we ultimately save costs to our far too expensive health care system.
Additionally, there are successful models for this type of center and clinic. The one closest to my heart is the clinic started in Bryan, TX, which was started by my family. Health for All has been in flourishing since 1985. It serves approximately 5000 patients today and is now affiliated with the Texas A&M Health Science Center Medical School so that doctors in training receive experience in providing underserved care. I had the privilege of watching the ins and outs of an amazing economically and ethnically diverse medical practice with a free medical clinic that works with people of all backgrounds, cultures, and socioeconomic status. At Karisha, I will utilize the best practices observed, creating a financial model where those who have resources to pay, receive great care and make it possible for those with fewer resources to get the same great care just by coming to our beautiful center. 
We also have the incredible advantage to ALREADY have a team of providers in place. I cannot say enough about the collective power and wisdom these skilled providers bring to the Karisha Community. 

I don't know of another collaborative like this one in the country -- with this many ethical, mission driven doctors and holistic providers dedicated to providing patient centered preventive, primary and urgent care, coming together to bridge food, medicine, and health, for all.

<p>Tina is a single
parent with three children. Sean was diagnosed with cancer at age 3 and he just
turned5 continues to fight his cancer battle and Tina struggles daily trying to
cover the cost of his medications (that are not covered by Pharmacare), and the
basic living costs of a family of 4. <br/></p><p>She can’t work because Sean’s care is a
full time job in itself. I’ve shared Sean’s story beginning with his diagnosis
at age 3 and now Sean and Tina’s family face another challenge in that the
cancer may have spread to Sean’s testicles or brain. </p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>How You Can Help<br/>
</h3>Tina struggles every month to put food on the table, cover the rent and pay for all the extras that Sean needs. Her story tells it all. She can't work because Sean needs her full time and his condition changes daily. <br/><br/>Tina asks for nothing except for Sean, affectionately nicknamed Seany, to get better. Every little bit of money we can raise will help her in ways that many of us do not understand. $5.00 $20.00 it doesn't matter the amount, although we would ask if you can offer more that would be amazing. Especially right now when Sean faces yet another battle. <br/><br/>A huge thank you to anyone that can help this family. <br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Tina and Sean's Cancer Story<br/>
</h3><p></p>
<p>Sean was
diagnosed with "" ALL"", Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia B-Cell, High Risk
on Oct.6,2011( 2 weeks after he turned 3)</p>
<p>We thought he
had the flu as he was very pale, very lethargic and had a constant fever.
Our GP refused to examine him and made us rush to BcCh ER ASAP. There
were easily 20 kids in that waiting room. When the nurses saw Sean they started
whispering amongst themselves and he was brought into an ER room right away .</p>
<p>An hour and a
half later, after the blood work was done, the doctor came back to see us with
the saddest face as he explained they were 95 % sure Sean had Leukemia:</p>
<p>It took a few
min to sink in and then I couldn't stop crying and begging the doctor not to let
him die . Whatever he needed, my blood. bone marrow, whatever I can give to him
to save him. Just please don't let my baby die</p>
<p>An Oncologist explained he would require an emergency transfusion
right away and then we literally went from the ER to the Oncology ward (3B)
where we were supposed to have stayed for 3 weeks. I was in a cot beside his
bed for almost 9 weeks, as he developed many I fractions- blood, fungal, etc.
and he list the ability to walk for several weeks too due to one of the chemos.</p>
<p>He continues to take daily chemo, steroids,
Septra, Methatrexate and more in addiition to monthly Lumbar Punctures where he
goes to BCCH , put under GA , Methatrexate is injected into his spine and they
extract spinal fluid which is taken to the lab to examine for presence of
cancer cells. With Leukemic patients, if they do relapse , quite often it is in
the brain or spinal fluid.</p><p><b></b></p><h3>Update on Sean<br/>
</h3>
 We saw Dr.Rod today and again I gave to say how very blessed we feel to
 have him as Seanny 's oncologist.He wants to move on Sean's case very 
quickly. Wed. am we'll have the biopsies done on both testicles and bone
 marrow. Sean will be admitted into BCCH indefinitely to begin treatment
 depending on biopsy results which Dr.Rod is working on getting

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
Tina is a single
parent with three children. Sean was diagnosed with cancer at age 3 and he just
turned5 continues to fight his cancer battle and Tina struggles daily trying to
cover the cost of his medications (that are not covered by Pharmacare), and the
basic living costs of a family of 4. She can’t work because Sean’s care is a
full time job in itself. I’ve shared Sean’s story beginning with his diagnosis
at age 3 and now Sean and Tina’s family face another challenge in that the
cancer may have spread to Sean’s testicles or brain. 
How You Can Help
Tina struggles every month to put food on the table, cover the rent and pay for all the extras that Sean needs. Her story tells it all. She can't work because Sean needs her full time and his condition changes daily. Tina asks for nothing except for Sean, affectionately nicknamed Seany, to get better. Every little bit of money we can raise will help her in ways that many of us do not understand. $5.00 $20.00 it doesn't matter the amount, although we would ask if you can offer more that would be amazing. Especially right now when Sean faces yet another battle. A huge thank you to anyone that can help this family. Tina and Sean's Cancer Story

Sean was
diagnosed with "" ALL"", Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia B-Cell, High Risk
on Oct.6,2011( 2 weeks after he turned 3)
We thought he
had the flu as he was very pale, very lethargic and had a constant fever.
Our GP refused to examine him and made us rush to BcCh ER ASAP. There
were easily 20 kids in that waiting room. When the nurses saw Sean they started
whispering amongst themselves and he was brought into an ER room right away .
An hour and a
half later, after the blood work was done, the doctor came back to see us with
the saddest face as he explained they were 95 % sure Sean had Leukemia:
It took a few
min to sink in and then I couldn't stop crying and begging the doctor not to let
him die . Whatever he needed, my blood. bone marrow, whatever I can give to him
to save him. Just please don't let my baby die
An Oncologist explained he would require an emergency transfusion
right away and then we literally went from the ER to the Oncology ward (3B)
where we were supposed to have stayed for 3 weeks. I was in a cot beside his
bed for almost 9 weeks, as he developed many I fractions- blood, fungal, etc.
and he list the ability to walk for several weeks too due to one of the chemos.
He continues to take daily chemo, steroids,
Septra, Methatrexate and more in addiition to monthly Lumbar Punctures where he
goes to BCCH , put under GA , Methatrexate is injected into his spine and they
extract spinal fluid which is taken to the lab to examine for presence of
cancer cells. With Leukemic patients, if they do relapse , quite often it is in
the brain or spinal fluid.Update on Sean

 We saw Dr.Rod today and again I gave to say how very blessed we feel to
 have him as Seanny 's oncologist.He wants to move on Sean's case very 
quickly. Wed. am we'll have the biopsies done on both testicles and bone
 marrow. Sean will be admitted into BCCH indefinitely to begin treatment
 depending on biopsy results which Dr.Rod is working on getting 
expedited ASAP . Potential treatments discussed were more aggressive 
forms of chemo, radiation, removal of testicle and / or bone marrow 
transplant. I will keep you all posted as soon as I learn something from
 Dr.Rod. I just ask that you please continue to pray for my baby boy and
 send positive healing thoughts / vibes his way. Love, TinaThe News Isn't Good - An Update From Tina

Fun, safe, and easy-to-use, it lets you train your pelvic floor muscles, improve your core strength, renew your confidence, and add a little extra something to your sexual enjoyment. THE POWER OF CONTROLExperience the many benefits of using Perifit    RAVE REVIEWS WHY ARE PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLES IMPORTANT?Strong pelvic floor muscles are a vital part of a healthy body. In particular, they are crucial in the following contexts:

Pregnancy: they are critically important during and after pregnancy, both in helping the body manage changes arising from the pregnancy and also in recovering more readily after birth.

Bladder control: they control the bladder and can prevent incontinence caused by stress, post-partum effects, aging, or other factors. Over 76% of women experience incontinence issues at some point in their life - strong pelvic floor muscles can prevent or resolve many of these problems without the complications of surgery.

Musculoskeletal stability: they support abdominal organs and provide stability for the entire pelvic region and lower spine; when weak or unstable they can cause back and pelvic pain.

Pleasure: they are an important part of a healthy sexual response for women. Strong pelvic floor muscles can enhance arousal and improve sensation, orgasm quality, and general sexual experience. 
However, despite the importance of pelvic floor muscles, tools to help exercise and manage them are extremely lacking. That’s where Perifit comes in...  WHAT IS PERIFIT ? Perifit is a pelvic floor sensor wirelessly connected to a smartphone which helps you tone up your pelvic floor muscles. It measures the force exerted by squeezing your pelvic floor muscles and can communicate that information back to you via your smartphone.
