<p>Billy Weatherall has been operating his gym, Christ Fit Gym, out of his garage for the last six years and has had more than 100 men come through his program. About six months ago, he decided to expand his Christian-based gym and will open around Sept. 1 on Benton Road near Southfield Grill.</p>
<p>Weatherall said his gym is for people who want to work out in a Christian environment.</p>
<p>""There is Christian music and scriptures on the wall. We start off every workout with a prayer and we do weekly Bible devotions,"" he said.</p>
<p>Weatherall, a certified International Sports Sciences Association trainer and a drill sergeant for the Army Reserves, said membership to his gym is free and there are no monthly contracts to sign. ""But we do ask for donations if the person is able to make them,"" he said.</p>
<p>Christ Fit Gym offers a variety of services, including boot camp classes specifically for men and women, PiYo, Zumba, kids classes, running programs, personal training, workout planning, diet planning and an after-school program. Weatherall also offers health and fitness supplements.</p>
<p>Christ Fit Gym's mission is based on 1 Timothy 4:8, ""For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.""</p>
<p>The road to Christianity was a long one for Weatherall, according to his testimony on his website.</p>
<p>"" ... Growing up I had an awesome Christian family that made me attend church regularly. ... I learned young in life that it pleased my folks to attend church, so I attended worship with a smile on my face without actually having a relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>""The day after I graduated high school I joined the Army. I started basic training and did some advanced schools in 2000. When I arrived to the 10th Mountain Division in Fort Drum, N.Y., my life changed drastically. The attacks on the World Trade Center sent my unit to Afghanistan for Operation Anaconda for a yearlong mission. Once back in the states for a short period of time, my unit was sent to the Horn of Africa for Operation Enduring Freedom for another yearlong mission. Days from fulfilling my contract of four years, I was stop lossed for a year and a half mission to Bagdad, Iraq, for Operation Iraqi Freedom.""</p>
<p>Weatherall goes on to say that after six years as an infantryman, he was ready to be back with his family and put the nightmares of war behind him. But that was easier said than done, for his life began to spin out of control with drugs and alcohol, among other addictions.</p>
<p>""One night I was about to take my life as I stared at a loaded 9mm. ... As I began to drink one last beer before ending it all, I looked over at a Bible a chaplain gave me when I was overseas that was also sitting on the coffee table along with my pistol. Having a Bible on hand always made me comfortable because I believed that if I had a Bible, which I never read, that God would allow me into heaven. ...</p>
<p>""Moments before I was about to put the 9mm to my temple, I decided to pick up my Bible. As I picked up the Bible I began to weep and for the first time in my life I cried out to Jesus. I asked Christ to pick me up because I was completely broken; everything in my life was completely out of control. I prayed myself to sleep that night, clutching my Bible, and I had made a decision to accept, believe and to give everything to Jesus Christ for the first time ever in my life.</p>
<p>""Early the next morning a buddy called me and invited me to Promise Keepers the next day. God always has perfect timing. While at the Promise Keeper's seminar I made a public profession of faith, and the next Sunday I was baptized at Airline Baptist Church. ...""</p>
<p>Weatherall says he never went back to the life he used to live and is now married to a ""beautiful Christian wife"" and has a ""precious little girl.""</p>
<p>My name is Billy Weatherall and I am in the process of opening a fitness organization in Bossier geared towards improving the health and fitness of our community in September 2012. Unlike every other gym in town, Christ Fit Gym will be a nonprofit organization—meaning it will be free of charge to anyone who attends. The organization is currently pending 501 c (3) status.  The organization will target all members of the community with a special emphasis on the underprivileged youth. Christ Fit Gym will offer after school fitness classes to students in low income neighborhoods in Bossier and/or Shreveport. In addition to underprivileged youth, the organization will offer a wide range of classes to both men and women of all ages. As is the nature of nonprofit organizations the gym rely on donations from charitable organizations in town and donations from regular attending gym goers. Most importantly Bible Devotions and prayers will be conducted regularly to build individuals spiritually along with physically.</p>

A very rare Seizure disorder with abnormal brain developments that has about 1000 cases worldwide currently (they are saying once the gene is found, it could be as many as 10,000).  She has overcome so much more than we ever envisioned. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie was also a rare candidate for a radical brain surgery called a hemispherectomy.  </strong>Around the end of July 2010, Katie's seizures took a turn for the worse. They not only increased, but we started noticing different kinds. We spoke with her neurologist, and a video EEG was ordered on 31 August 2010. The results of the test were very dark. Katie was seizing constantly on the right side of her brain. So much so, the doctor was very worried. We discussed the possibility of VNS, and Dr Mettrick did not think this would help with the types of seizures she was having. We discussed brain surgery. </p>
<p>Long story short, on 1 November 2010, Katie went to UCLA to see if she was eligible for brain surgery. After three days of testing, the results of the retests, and new tests, confirmed the August results. Katie was eligible for and needed surgery. In addition to the seizures she was not showing, Katie's seizures were on a dramatic rise and intensity. I cannot even begin tell you how intense and nasty her seizures were getting, but sometimes she vomited and stoped breathing. They got worse every day and she was regressing.</p>
<p>Katie had her for surgery on 22 November 2010. We arrived on the 17th of November, and had her surgery on the 22nd. We know in our hearts this is the right path that God sent us down for this the surgery.  Katie is doing well and was featured on The Today Show concerning her recovery from this surgery and being a rare candidate for surgery (being an Aicardi Girl).  Despite that one seizure on 19 May 2012 at 0800 in the morning, we have not seen any seizures since restarting a seizure med.</p>
<p>Katie is doing great, but she had many signs of another disorder called Autism. Eye averting, not really wanting to be touched, lacking social skills, and non verbal. We went though the process (six months) and was diagnosed with One of the things that has been great for Katie is her IPAD 1.  We use her IPAD for so many things. It has a photo book of us she can scroll through, apps for her to learn from, a great positive reinforcign tool.  We use it to 'tell her' about things we about to do like on 'ischedule' and it has an Augg comm app, but that is not it's sole use. We do have another talker to be her voice. </p>
<p>But Katie's IPAD is broken. Katie is young and imbalanced with Aicardi Syndrome and the Hemispherectomy causing something called Hemiparisis- a weakness on the left side. It has a stroke like 'look'. Falling and dropping the IPAD over the past 3 years, and her excessive drooling, have taken it's toll. It is still somewhat functional, but the sound is gone, and will only reappear spatically. The button is starting to stick, and the IPAD freezes up alot. The right side is bulging from the dropping. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are not able to purchase an IPAD at this time. We are a one income family, and my job is ending on 30 Sep, 2012. We will use it till it is on it's last legs, but Katie is getting more and more frustrated with it's sound not function and it's freezing up. Any help you could provide- $1 would be great towards the purchase of an IPAD 3 for Katie and a durable case to make it last against her dropping and drooling. </p>

<p>Ramaya is a rural Nepali mother and grandmother. She works
to feed her growing family from sunset and sundown. Like many Nepalis, her
family lives hand to mouth, depending on the day’s earnings to fill their
stomachs. Recently, Ramaya was diagnosed with debilitating bladder stones and
her husband suffered a bad fall, breaking six of his ribs; because of these
health problems, both of them are struggling to make a sustainable income, as
well as pay their medical bills. </p>
<p>Feeding one’s family today often takes precedent over caring
for your health tomorrow. Her husband’s ribs will heal, but Ramaya’s bladder
stones must be surgically removed—an operation that costs $700, almost 100
times her daily wage. All the contributions for Ramaya’s surgery will be handed
over to her family after the operation, so the money raised will directly
reimburse her medical costs. </p>
<p><b>How You Can Help</b></p>
<p>This campaign is seeking small denominations and aiming to
reach a large amount of prospective donors. We realize that most people can’t
give a hefty amount of cash at one time, and are asking for only small amounts,
or whatever you feel compelled to give.  Any amount you can donate will contribute to
Ramaya’s health and therefore, the welfare of her family. All funds raised will
directly fund Ramaya’s surgery, drugs, and hospital care. </p>
<p>If you can’t donate, we understand! Help us get the word
out, so more people can generously spare some change for this cause. Please
share this with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, or listservs. We sincerely
appreciate your time and support, whether you directly contribute or rally
around the cause.</p>
<p><b>Who Is Handling this
Campaign, Anyways?</b></p>
<p>My name is Kristen Gentry and I am a project coordinator for
ethnographic research in Nepal. Being far from home, I always miss my family,
but have been blessed with a selfless, caring, and comforting surrogate family
here. Ramaya is my Nepali <i>aamaa</i> and I
care about her deeply. </p><p>Other colleagues on the research team, also concerned for Ramaya's health, are supporting the management of this campaign. In addition to this fundraising, they are involved
in several development projects in the area, such as a clean water projects and
animal husbandry projects. </p>

<p><b>Background:</b></p>
<p>On
April 25, 2015 the Kathmandu area of Nepal experienced a 7.8 magnitude
earthquake, followed by another major quake of 7.3 on May 12 leaving over 8,500
people dead and at least 23,000 with injuries.  It was the deadliest earthquake on record to hit the
Himalayan country. Hundreds
of thousands of people became homeless,
children were orphaned, and thousands of homes, schools and businesses were
destroyed, including shelters for homeless and other vulnerable people such as
sex trafficking survivors, hospitals and medical clinics.</p>
<p>Many people are now
suffering from psychological trauma that is further complicated by ongoing
threats to their survival.  Reports
from staff members of local agencies confirm it is very difficult to find
quality mental health care.  We
have received multiple requests for skilled psychotherapeutic support and
training to help identified clients/patients, staff members, and students cope
with ongoing fear, hyper-vigilance and other symptoms of post-traumatic stress.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lotus Circle International (LCI)
is responding to these pleas for help by sending Beth Nielsen and Lisa LaDue,
both trauma experts, to Kathmandu, Nepal to offer trauma training specific to
post-disaster settings. LCI’s project aims to reduce symptoms of post-traumatic
stress and increase resiliency through teaching simple skills based on Somatic
Experiencing.  Somatic
Experiencing, a cutting-edge, holistic, psycho-biologically based trauma
treatment model, provides individuals with self-empowerment skills to bring
their minds and bodies back into balance.  </p>

<p><b><u>Project Description:</u></b></p>
<p>Beth Nielsen and Lisa La Due, both with extensive expertise in traumatic stress, will be in Nepal for approximately 18 days in August – September 2015 to offer clinical trauma training, consultation and interventions to organizations serving vulnerable populations. Trauma-focused trainings and interventions aiming to increase stabilization, build resilience, and to minimize the effects of the traumatic stress experienced by earthquake survivors will be provided for multiple organizations including a shelter for women and children who have experienced violence; a private school system in Kathmandu; and an voluntary organization of medical doctors working to improve living conditions and health in rural Nepal. Discussions are continuing with these and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to maximize the use of Beth and Lisa’s time and expertise while in Nepal.</p>
<p>In addition to direct training and interventions, the three-week schedule includes time for consultation with these local organizations to strengthen new skills; assessment and consultation to identify current, short-term and long-term community mental health and resilience needs; and an assessment of potential needs and resources for an ongoing, sustainable training/consultation program for identified organizations.</p>
<p><b><u>Project Model and Method</u></b></p>
<p>The Trauma Recovery Project for Nepal will utilize a combination of experiential training for local psychosocial services providers, teachers, students and clients; demonstrations of clinical methods and skills; mentoring of providers’ use of skills; and provision of direct interventions, as appropriate.  The training/treating/mentoring model is aimed at providing a sustainable foundation of knowledge and skills providing essential self-regulation skills and leading to personal and community resilience.</p>
<p>The training will address skills and interventions for trauma healing drawn from the Somatic Experiencing® method, developed by Dr. Peter Levine.  Dr. Levine developed Somatic Experiencing® (SE) as a body-awareness approach to healing trauma based on extensive research of the way animals respond to trauma in the wild. His theories are supported by neuroscience research and ongoing studies of the way the autonomic nervous system of humans responds to threat and trauma. The Somatic Experiencing Trauma Institute (SETI) has trained thousands of therapists worldwide. This culturally sensitive training will place a strong emphasis on nervous system stabilization and empowerment, as well as basic levels of trauma resolution.  Utilizing experiential modules, the training will include a broad range of trauma-sensitive intervention skills.</p>
<p>One of the intended outcomes of these trainings for multiple organizations is the creation of a network of skilled individuals and organizations providing effective, trauma-sensitive care, thus strengthening relationships and enhancing the healing and resilience of individuals, families and communities in Nepal </p>
<p>Beth Nielsen and Lisa LaDue will meet with representatives of numerous Nepalese organizations to discuss and assess needs for an ongoing, sustainable mind-body healing program based on Somatic Experiencing®.  If feasible, plans will be developed for regularly scheduled, returning LCI teams to expand and strengthen the initial work accomplished during this trip.</p>

Update: August 25, 2015
Hello everyone,
Thank you for your suppport and generous contributions. We are very grateful and honored to be here in Nepal helping with the post eartquake recovery by offering training to local counselors and doctors in basic trauma healing skills. We arrived  on Friday August 21 and spent the first few days acclimating to the new time zone and beginning to attend to scheduling our time here with our local contacts.
As is important and necessary for good SE work, Lisa and I began our work here by orienting to the environment, joining with and learning about the local culture,  and settling our own bodies in preparation for the four trainings we will be doing starting tomorrow. 
We are staying at the Shechen Monastery Guest House, nearby to the Boudhanath Stupa, one of the holiest Tibetan Buddhist stupa's outside of Tibet and are feeling very safe and well taken care of here. Below is a photo of the stupa, which is being repaired due to earthquake damage. I found it to be a beautiful experience to circumambulate the stupa in the morning chanting Om Mani Padme Om alongside the Nepali people and feeling their deep devotion.


Boudhanath Stupa, Kathmandu, Nepal
Today, after getting my broken computer fixed and purchasing some medicine for LIsa at a local pharmacy, I briefly visited one the the tent camps still occupied by many homeless earthquake survivors. I learned from my taxi driver that the walls surrounding the luxurious Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kathmandu fell down during the earthquake and the precious open land was quickly inhabitted by people who lost their homes.


Tent City August 25, 2015: Still home to many earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, NepalTomorrow we are scheduled to begin our training for Chhori, in collaboration with the Art2Healing project, founded by art therapist, Atira Tan. Chhori is a non-profit organization working in Nepal to promote girl’s education and enhance young women’s livelihood opportunities. However, late in the day today, we heard there may be another ""Banda"" (a government shutdown including restrictions on using roads) starting tomorrow due to the recent violent clashes protesting the proposed new constitution.   Given this,  there is a possibility we may need to postpone starting the training until the strike is lifted. If this is the case, we will need to stay put in the monastery to make sure we avoid any risky situations. This is another reminder that in this kind of humanitarian work, it is necessary to let go, remain flexible, and see what happens next.
We will keep you updated.

Dates:
Initial trip to be August 19  -September 9, 2015 
Dependent upon results of onsite assessment and consultation with local Nepali organizations, plans may be established for follow-up teams to provide ongoing training and aftercare services on a regularly scheduled (quarterly or semi-annually) basis.  These plans will be dependent upon sustainable funding and staffing resources as well as safety conditions in Nepal.

Funding:
LCI is seeking funding for the initial trip with 2 team members (Lisa Ladue and Beth Nielsen), as well as a second trip to Nepal with 4 team members. This will likely be a two-year recovery project involving multiple trips.  Direct and indirect costs for both trips total approximately  $23,000. ($12,400.00 for the intial trip).
Direct expenses include airline tickets, ground transportation, visas, lodging and food for the full duration of a 3-week project, training costs and service expenses (rent for the training or service locations, translator fees, internet fees, training materials costs). 
Indirect costs include project-related operating costs, modest stipends for team members, and administrative costs (website, fund-raising expenses, accounting fees).  A complete outline of the budget is available upon request from Beth Nielsen.
Please consider making a donation to Lotus Circle international for this project through Indiegogo at https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/nepal-trauma-healing-project#/story.  If you would like more information, please contact Beth Nielsen at (415) 359-5597 or by email at Bethlotus@gmail.com.

<p>The education system in rural Laos does not prioritize creative or physical activities. There are no after-school programs offered and education tends to be very formal and follow a strict textbook curriculum.  The majority of physical activity among youth and children comes from supporting families by working in the fields or playing with friends at home. </p>
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">In the communities near the Sai Nyai Eco-School, most people depend on subsistence agriculture and can therefore get stuck in a routine of waking with the sun, spending their day in the fields, and returning home at night. This cycle does not usually stimulate youth and can instead lead to boredom, which sometimes paves the way to drug addiction or extreme consumption of alcohol - two growing problems in the area. Aside from the resources at the Community Learning Center at Sai Nyai, sports equipment, arts and crafts supplies, music, books, and games are not readily available to the community.</p>

The Challenge

The education system in rural Laos does not prioritize creative or physical activities. There are no after-school programs offered and education tends to be very formal and follow a strict textbook curriculum.  The majority of physical activity among youth and children comes from supporting families by working in the fields or playing with friends at home. 
In the communities near the Sai Nyai Eco-School, most people depend on subsistence agriculture and can therefore get stuck in a routine of waking with the sun, spending their day in the fields, and returning home at night. This cycle does not usually stimulate youth and can instead lead to boredom, which sometimes paves the way to drug addiction or extreme consumption of alcohol - two growing problems in the area. Aside from the resources at the Community Learning Center at Sai Nyai, sports equipment, arts and crafts supplies, music, books, and games are not readily available to the community.
Additionally, women and girls are isolated from the few physical activities (soccer/football and sepak takraw) available because sports tend to be very masculine in this part of Laos. There is also little knowledge about health, nutrition, and the spread of germs. Because of this, malnutrition and disease are rampant. 


Our Idea




To implement the Leadership and Empowerment Through Sport (LETS)
project, a sustainable sport for development program that uses rugby as a tool
to vitalize local youth and children by giving them opportunities to
participate in recreational activities while promoting healthy lifestyle
choices and personal development. We believe that sport provides lessons in teamwork, goal
setting, discipline, and has the ability to relieve stress and improve quality
of life. 
In a very patriarchal society, where girls
tend to be ostracized from ""manly"" activities (such as
football/soccer), an unknown sport -- like rugby -- is a good way to intrigue
and involve female participants. LETS empowers women and girls and
increases their leadership and confidence.
All of our activities promote healthy life choices.
After thoroughly washing hands with soap and water, the participants
are invited to eat local fresh fruits or other healthy snacks. We aim to create healthy habits through
demonstration and repetition, instead of through lecturing.
The LETS Project is a collaboration between the Sai Nyai Eco-School and the Lao Rugby Federation.

<h3>A little about myself &amp; family <span style=""font-size: 10px;""><br/></span>
</h3>
<p>My name is Melody Ysasaga, I am 36 years old and have been happily married for almost 11 years. My husbands name is Che who has 2 daughters, Tori (18), and Cecilia (17).  Che would give the shirt off his back and would do anything for anybody.  One of the nicest people I have ever met and my best friend.</p>
<p>On June 7th, 2013 a mass the size of a melon was found growing between Che's left lung and his heart.  On June 21st, 2013 he went in for surgery to have it removed and the doctor found that it had grown into his lung and damaged his diaphragm.  Six hours of surgery later and the top lobe of his left lung had to be removed with the tumor, and his diaphragm worked on.  His left diaphragm does not work now but needed stitched down so it didn't affect his breathing.  Che had to stay in the hospital for 7days and probably should have stayed longer.  He has a long road to recovery while his body heals and as his body gains it's strength again after such a complicated surgery.  </p>
<p>Che is the ""moneymaker"" between the two of us making over double my salary.  So him having to take so much time off work has really had a compact on our finances.  We recently moved into a bigger house to accomodate our family and needing a bigger place.  A lot of our bills are just having to go unpaid which is something we would NEVER do if we didn't absolutely have to.  And we are not the type of people who ask for help feeling like it would be a ""handout"" but we really need some help.  I don't know what else to do.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Che is expected to be off for at least 8-10 weeks, we are going on week 3 and are already behind.  Our parents have helped out with what they could but we could use some more for rent ($1450/mo), necessary bills (utilities), and groceries. Any amount of money that we get will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>The only thing that we can give back in return is our gratitude, I wish we had more to offer.  Come over any day of the week and I will make ya dinner.  :)</p>

I am married to Tony Gambone, we have a 5 children between us and have been together for 21 years. Tony was diagnosed 37 years ago with Crohns disease, at the time there wasn't much known about Crohn's. He has since had 3 surgeries and has a colostomy. We have been blessed as he hasn't had any issues until 3 years ago. August of 08 the world that I knew ceased to exist. Since then we have been in and out of the hospital on many occasions and because he was never insurable due to his disease we have been going through the County Hospital district, which is a whole other discussion and nightmare. We have lost our business and Tony is now on disability, which we are thankful for but doesn't even cover our mortgage. All of this is OK if we can get Tony the treatment that he needs. I can get another house but I can't get another Tony, he and my children are my life.There are many new developments in the adult stem cell treatment and Tony is a great candidate. It is not offered in the US so we have to travel out of the country for it.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only do I want to be able to raise money for Tony to have this procedure done, I also want to try to raise awareness of what is possible for so many others with many other conditions. This treatment is one of the last options for Tony. He has already had so much of his insides removed the doctors are very hesitant to remove any more. He is very high risk for surgery and that is the only thing that could possibly help him for a short time, so we thought. Until we found out about the stem cell treatments we thought we had to just a sit around and wait for things to get really bad and hope for the best. Things are okay, his quality of life is okay for now, other than changing out bandages twice a day from his intestinal fluids leaking out of his stomach in four places and being tired a lot more that he use to be he is good and mostly in good spirits. Tony is very active in giving to others and promoting others on his internet radio show, he has so much more to offer this world but may not get the chance without these treatments. God has led us on this path and we're not sure where it is going to take us but we are living it one day at a time and trusting Him. </p>

I have been pounding the pavement for months now but the area I live in and surrounding communities are slow to react to this. Disasters of the level Rapid Disaster Relief wants to deploy for rarely happen here and most of the people I talk to I have to educate on what the Red Cross and FEMA do and where Rapid Disaster Relief fits in. Most of the responses I get are ""we have the Red Cross and my tax dollars go for FEMA"". When we get those responses I sit with them and show them the void that Rapid Disaster Relief will fill. By the consistent effort of the team,we are getting close to our goal and I hope to find more funding to get multiple setups going. I really don't think there is a ""right way"" to explain the Red Cross and FEMA's issuses without sounding like we are diminishing or ""bashing"" them, because we are in NO WAY doing that.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This may sound a little odd but when all of the storms hit during the last two weeks , I was getting frustrated while watching the news reports. The Red Cross did a great job responding but still wasn't enough. They are doing way too many tasks at a disaster to be fully efficient. In the North Carolina disaster it took them longer to get shelter up because they were trying to get the food, water, clothing and medical services going. The storms in MS, AR and OK last week  were the same result. I don't want to include this when I am presenting Rapid Disaster Relief because I never want it to sound like we are diminishing the Red Cross because they do an amazing job. What Rapid Disaster Relief is doing is helping them and other relief efforts be better equipped and more successful at each disaster site. We're not trying to reinvent the wheel, Rapid Disaster Relief is just trying to perfect it.</p><b><br/></b><p></p>
<p><b>Purpose of the Rapid Disaster Relief (R.D.R.)</b></p>
<p>The purpose of Rapid Disaster Relief is to
relieve human suffering caused by natural disasters by providing a 12,000 sq.
ft. air supported structure that will be operated via solar and wind turbine
power and have a backup generator with an auto switch to maintain constant
power. The structure will house 500 cots for disaster victims as well as a Red
Cross station inside for their first responders. R.D.R. will also provide
satellite television for local and national news and satellite internet for the
disaster victims to stay in communication with family members via a bank of
laptops located  inside the structure. We
will also provide shower stations as well as porta-potties. This structure will
also provide an area for other relief groups to have a command center to aid in
their efforts as well. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">We will be working with various disaster
organizations and local authorities in order to achieve this goal: American Red
Cross, The Salvation Army, Church organizations and a variety of groups.</span></p><p><b>Rapid Disaster Relief Flowchart</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/488328/files/20140406145802-RDR_Flowchart_69.jpeg?1396821482"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/486091/files/20140405121710-m15340343_763x260-sandy-response-011698.jpg?1396725430"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 234.22680412371133px; height: 80px;""/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">   Our Shelters will also be used as a hub to centrally locate supplies and help in one location.</span><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/486093/files/20140405121931-121119091908-red-cross-disaster-relief-monster.jpg?1396725571"" src="""" style=""width: 218.46153846153845px; height: 125px;""/>  We will work hand in hand with other relief efforts to house not only disaster victims but food, water, clothing and other personal necessities.  </p><br/><p></p>

</span></p><p><span><b>Motivation of Rapid Disaster Relief (R.D.R.)</b></span></p>
<p>To provide physical, emotional, and spiritual
help to victims of natural and man-made disasters, including floods,
earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and fires in the United States. Our primary
goal is to provide assistance to anyone that is in distress due to a disaster. At
every opportunity we must ensure that each person that we have contact with
feels safe and secure during this terrifying time in their life. Well, just how
do we define a disaster?  A disaster is
anything that causes human suffering or creates human needs that the victims
cannot alleviate themselves. More than likely, you or someone you know has been
in that position.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/488458/files/20140406161402-Dramatic_Pattern_Change_Later_in_Spring_Early_Summer_2014_text_only.jpeg?1396826042"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/488464/files/20140406161444-650x366_03061640_hd23.jpg?1396826084"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/488465/files/20140406161506-torngraph-big.png?1396826106"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/488467/files/20140406161528-Tornado_Map.jpg?1396826128"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Mission Statement</b></p>
<p>The goal of Rapid Disaster Relief is to
provide an immediate shelter to people in need due to disasters. We seek
to provide organization, equipment, and strategy for committed volunteers
and paid employees to help affected individuals/families in their worst time of
need. Some of the other ways we respond are through; Administration,
Assessment, Communications, Childcare, Help in Search and Rescue, Laundry (Tide
Trucks), Logistics, Mass feeding (supplied by other Disaster groups), Recovery
(debris removal), Shower, Water, etc. </p>
<p>The question is not whether a disaster will
occur in your region—it is a question of when it will strike. Disasters don’t
always occur on weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  R.D.R. will be prepared to travel day or night
to respond to the need of the community affected. We will be located near
developing storms so we can deploy our structure immediately. The R.D.R. team
will be traveling and staying in an R.V. along with a semi-truck and trailer.
We will be staying at truck stops to keep cost expenditures to a minimum so we
can maximize the use of the donation dollars.</p><p></p><p><b>The Personal Motivation</b></p><p>The concept for Rapid Disaster Relief was inspired years ago while storm-chasing.  Over time, something that began as a past-time for an amateur enthusiast quickly spawned a desire to help those caught up in the destruction and aftermath of these storms.  Traveling from town-to-town following weather patterns for sheer excitement soon faded into a somber realization that the people I saw couldn't just move on to the next place once the storm was over.  Life for them continued on in devastation long after the footage stopped.  Words can't begin to describe the feelings you experience when you see families standing out in front of what used to be their dream homes, holding each other.  Others frantically calling out for help trying to find their loved ones, climbing over debris.  Seeing entire families standing along the side of the road with nothing but a duffel bag with a change of clothes, realizing that they have no place to go.  A man clinching the shoulder of his wife, holding his screaming child in his arms trying to convince them as well as himself that everything will be ok.  The look of utter hopelessness across his face as he fights back his tears to be strong for his family The rubble behind them representing only a fraction of what they truly lost.  And knowing that they were the lucky ones.</p><p>It is because of experiences like these that I am so passionate about helping the victims of disasters.  To provide them with a place to go and let the people they love know that they are all right while they try to figure out what to do next. </p><p>While our initial plan is to establish one set-up to respond to disasters, moving from one location to the next as needed, in the long term we hope to build a fleet ready to go anywhere in the country whenever needed as we gain funding and staffing.  Our long-term goal will allow for shelters to be in use for longer durations while more permanent accommodations can be made as well as allowing us to respond to disasters in various parts of the country at the same time.  While no one really knows where disasters will hit, we hope to provide victims with the answer ""Where will we go?""</p><p></p>
<p><b>2014 Disaster Relief Training </b></p>
<p>Preparation is the best form of disaster
response. All members of the R.D.R. Disaster Relief Team will go through our
required training and Red Cross First Aid training before being allowed on site.
You don't have to be trained to participate in some portions of our response,
however, we highly recommend that you become a part of the team. Our
preference, of course, is that everyone go through training in order to
understand the guidelines for response: policies, procedures, safety, etc.</p>
<p><b>Donations</b></p>
<p>Virtually 100% of Rapid Disaster Relief
(R.D.R.) is funded by donations. If you would like to support this relief
effort we will keep all contributors up to date via social media (i.e. photos,
daily posts, detailed operation successes, etc.) Disasters don’t all come in
large packages like hurricanes or tornadoes. 
Oftentimes a disaster can be mudslides or fires and with the support of
donations, R.D.R will be there to help.</p>
<p><b>2014 Rapid Disaster Relief (R.D.R.) Donation Perks</b></p>
<p>Although we would like to offer big perks for
your donations, R.D.R. feels that the money from the donations should be used

<p></p></div>","Just a short Video and a few pics from a recent storm chaseA word from Joe and the RDR TeamI appreciate all of the help you many others have provided thus far. I have been pounding the pavement for months now but the area I live in and surrounding communities are slow to react to this. Disasters of the level Rapid Disaster Relief wants to deploy for rarely happen here and most of the people I talk to I have to educate on what the Red Cross and FEMA do and where Rapid Disaster Relief fits in. Most of the responses I get are ""we have the Red Cross and my tax dollars go for FEMA"". When we get those responses I sit with them and show them the void that Rapid Disaster Relief will fill. By the consistent effort of the team,we are getting close to our goal and I hope to find more funding to get multiple setups going. I really don't think there is a ""right way"" to explain the Red Cross and FEMA's issuses without sounding like we are diminishing or ""bashing"" them, because we are in NO WAY doing that.This may sound a little odd but when all of the storms hit during the last two weeks , I was getting frustrated while watching the news reports. The Red Cross did a great job responding but still wasn't enough. They are doing way too many tasks at a disaster to be fully efficient. In the North Carolina disaster it took them longer to get shelter up because they were trying to get the food, water, clothing and medical services going. The storms in MS, AR and OK last week  were the same result. I don't want to include this when I am presenting Rapid Disaster Relief because I never want it to sound like we are diminishing the Red Cross because they do an amazing job. What Rapid Disaster Relief is doing is helping them and other relief efforts be better equipped and more successful at each disaster site. We're not trying to reinvent the wheel, Rapid Disaster Relief is just trying to perfect it.
Purpose of the Rapid Disaster Relief (R.D.R.)
The purpose of Rapid Disaster Relief is to
relieve human suffering caused by natural disasters by providing a 12,000 sq.
ft. air supported structure that will be operated via solar and wind turbine
power and have a backup generator with an auto switch to maintain constant
power. The structure will house 500 cots for disaster victims as well as a Red
Cross station inside for their first responders. R.D.R. will also provide
satellite television for local and national news and satellite internet for the
disaster victims to stay in communication with family members via a bank of
laptops located  inside the structure. We
will also provide shower stations as well as porta-potties. This structure will
also provide an area for other relief groups to have a command center to aid in
their efforts as well. We will be working with various disaster
organizations and local authorities in order to achieve this goal: American Red
Cross, The Salvation Army, Church organizations and a variety of groups.Rapid Disaster Relief Flowchart   Our Shelters will also be used as a hub to centrally locate supplies and help in one location.  We will work hand in hand with other relief efforts to house not only disaster victims but food, water, clothing and other personal necessities.  

Motivation of Rapid Disaster Relief (R.D.R.)
To provide physical, emotional, and spiritual
help to victims of natural and man-made disasters, including floods,
earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and fires in the United States. Our primary
goal is to provide assistance to anyone that is in distress due to a disaster. At
every opportunity we must ensure that each person that we have contact with
feels safe and secure during this terrifying time in their life. Well, just how
do we define a disaster?  A disaster is
anything that causes human suffering or creates human needs that the victims
cannot alleviate themselves. More than likely, you or someone you know has been
in that position.
Mission Statement
The goal of Rapid Disaster Relief is to
provide an immediate shelter to people in need due to disasters. We seek
to provide organization, equipment, and strategy for committed volunteers
and paid employees to help affected individuals/families in their worst time of
need. Some of the other ways we respond are through; Administration,
Assessment, Communications, Childcare, Help in Search and Rescue, Laundry (Tide
Trucks), Logistics, Mass feeding (supplied by other Disaster groups), Recovery
(debris removal), Shower, Water, etc. 
The question is not whether a disaster will
occur in your region—it is a question of when it will strike. Disasters don’t
always occur on weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  R.D.R. will be prepared to travel day or night
to respond to the need of the community affected. We will be located near
developing storms so we can deploy our structure immediately. The R.D.R. team
will be traveling and staying in an R.V. along with a semi-truck and trailer.
We will be staying at truck stops to keep cost expenditures to a minimum so we
can maximize the use of the donation dollars.The Personal MotivationThe concept for Rapid Disaster Relief was inspired years ago while storm-chasing.  Over time, something that began as a past-time for an amateur enthusiast quickly spawned a desire to help those caught up in the destruction and aftermath of these storms.  Traveling from town-to-town following weather patterns for sheer excitement soon faded into a somber realization that the people I saw couldn't just move on to the next place once the storm was over.  Life for them continued on in devastation long after the footage stopped.  Words can't begin to describe the feelings you experience when you see families standing out in front of what used to be their dream homes, holding each other.  Others frantically calling out for help trying to find their loved ones, climbing over debris.  Seeing entire families standing along the side of the road with nothing but a duffel bag with a change of clothes, realizing that they have no place to go.  A man clinching the shoulder of his wife, holding his screaming child in his arms trying to convince them as well as himself that everything will be ok.  The look of utter hopelessness across his face as he fights back his tears to be strong for his family The rubble behind them representing only a fraction of what they truly lost.  And knowing that they were the lucky ones.It is because of experiences like these that I am so passionate about helping the victims of disasters.  To provide them with a place to go and let the people they love know that they are all right while they try to figure out what to do next. While our initial plan is to establish one set-up to respond to disasters, moving from one location to the next as needed, in the long term we hope to build a fleet ready to go anywhere in the country whenever needed as we gain funding and staffing.  Our long-term goal will allow for shelters to be in use for longer durations while more permanent accommodations can be made as well as allowing us to respond to disasters in various parts of the country at the same time.  While no one really knows where disasters will hit, we hope to provide victims with the answer ""Where will we go?""
2014 Disaster Relief Training 
Preparation is the best form of disaster
response. All members of the R.D.R. Disaster Relief Team will go through our
required training and Red Cross First Aid training before being allowed on site.
You don't have to be trained to participate in some portions of our response,
however, we highly recommend that you become a part of the team. Our
preference, of course, is that everyone go through training in order to
understand the guidelines for response: policies, procedures, safety, etc.
Donations
Virtually 100% of Rapid Disaster Relief
(R.D.R.) is funded by donations. If you would like to support this relief
effort we will keep all contributors up to date via social media (i.e. photos,
daily posts, detailed operation successes, etc.) Disasters don’t all come in
large packages like hurricanes or tornadoes. 
Oftentimes a disaster can be mudslides or fires and with the support of
donations, R.D.R will be there to help.
2014 Rapid Disaster Relief (R.D.R.) Donation Perks
Although we would like to offer big perks for
your donations, R.D.R. feels that the money from the donations should be used
for the relief effort. We are offering to our donors a very deep and
heartfelt thank you as well as the following:
1. 
Sponsor
a cot.
For
your donation of $500.00 you will sponsor a cot for a disaster victim. There

<h3>How It Began:</h3>
<p>       While acting as a Summer Orientation Undergraduate Leader (SOUL) for Miami University of Oxford, Ohio, I stumbled upon a small and fairly unpublicized organization known as ""<b>Beards for Boobs</b>"" on our university's club website.  Although the prospect of defaulting into a student organization due to my ability to grow a beard was what initially piqued my interest, upon reading further into the organization's mission, I discovered the cause of its whimsical name.  </p>
<p>       The organization exists so that during the month of November, men who are a part of the group can grow out their facial hair in honor of No Shave November and ask for donations in return.  Subsequent to doing so , all funds accrued get donated to the Susan G. Komen Foundation, a non-profit that raises money to fund breast cancer research projects in an attempt to find a cure. It was such a simple, easy, and efficient way to earn money in the name of charity.  There was only one problem--no one I knew had heard of it.  </p>
<p>       I approached the members of<b> Lambda Chi Alpha</b> (the fraternity I am in) with the prospect of participating in Beards for Boobs as a group so that we could raise a fairly large amount of money to donate.   The idea was received well, and as a result the vast majority of ΛΧΑ members will be participating in No Shave November and asking for donations for the Susan G. Komen Foundation.  <br/><br/>       After having a number of meetings and organizing events so that everyone was aware of the Beards for Boobs donation schedule, I felt that we had all become a part of a very solid and efficient way to help out.  After all, money can be donated to the organization by a simple click of a button on their website.  My roommate (Adam Darby) and I decided that <b>we needed to take this charity effort a step further</b>, though.  We've turned the donation process into an inter-fraternal competition, in which every ΛΧΑ member participating in No Shave November will be competing against one another to see who can raise the most money.  There is no prize for winning--simply the satisfaction of knowing that we were a<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ble to start something that showed results.  </span></p>
<p>       Beginning <b>November 1st</b>, Adam and I will upload a picture of ourselves to an <b>Imgur</b> and <b>Tumblr</b> account in order to track the progress of our Novembeards.  The links to these pages can be found on my main Indiegogo page or by visiting <a href=""http://themightynovembeard.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://themightynovembeard.tumblr.com/</a> <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><a href=""http://imgur.com/user/themightynovembeard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">http://imgur.com/user/themightynovembeard</a></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>       In a breakdown, it's really quite simple.  Our goal is to raise at LEAST $1,000 to donate to Beards for Boobs and the Susan G. Komen Foundation (description above), and we need your help in order to do that.  </p>
<p>       The first three contributors to donate $100 or more will be sent a commemorative plaque to thank them for their generous donations.  The plaques will include their name, date, sum donated, the organization names, and will act as an official ""thank you"" from the brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha for helping us with our donation efforts.  </p>
<p>       Fear not---money used to purchase the plaques will be allocated directly from personal or fraternity funds; none of the money donated will be used for any purpose other than non-profit donation.  </p>
<p>       In the event that we are not able to reach our entire goal, what happens with the money will change.  All money raised will still go to Beards for Boobs and the Susan G. Komen Foundation.  However, in the event that we fall grossly short of our goal, no commemorative plaques will be distributed to the top three contributors.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>       Every penny of your donation will fund cancer research and a search for a cure.  From research grants to necessary equipment, the effort to help discover a cure for cancer is in need of people like you and me to pitch in and help.  </p>
<p></p>

       In a breakdown, it's really quite simple.  Our goal is to raise at LEAST $1,000 to donate to Beards for Boobs and the Susan G. Komen Foundation (description above), and we need your help in order to do that.  
       The first three contributors to donate $100 or more will be sent a commemorative plaque to thank them for their generous donations.  The plaques will include their name, date, sum donated, the organization names, and will act as an official ""thank you"" from the brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha for helping us with our donation efforts.  
       Fear not---money used to purchase the plaques will be allocated directly from personal or fraternity funds; none of the money donated will be used for any purpose other than non-profit donation.  
       In the event that we are not able to reach our entire goal, what happens with the money will change.  All money raised will still go to Beards for Boobs and the Susan G. Komen Foundation.  However, in the event that we fall grossly short of our goal, no commemorative plaques will be distributed to the top three contributors.  


The Impact
       Every penny of your donation will fund cancer research and a search for a cure.  From research grants to necessary equipment, the effort to help discover a cure for cancer is in need of people like you and me to pitch in and help.  


Other Ways You Can Help
Can't donate at this time? No sweat.  Donating isn't the only way you can help fight against breast cancer:



Learn the signs and symptoms.  One of the easiest ways to prevent breast cancer from having a hugely negative impact on someone's life is early recognition.  The sooner it's caught, the easier it is to prevent harm.  Learn about risk factors and prevention by visiting http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/LowerYourRisk.html


Participate in an event.  Events to spread awareness of breast cancer can be found by visiting http://ww5.komen.org/FindAnEvent.aspx


Take a stand. Sign up to become a Komen Advocate by visiting http://www.komenadvocacy.org/ (details on the page)

Start your own fundraiser.  Become a Passionately Pink Event Coordinator by visiting http://ww5.komen.org/GetInvolved/PassionatelyPink.html

<p>When I was 15 years old, I nearly died from a stroke caused by severe anorexia. I was 58 pounds, severely depressed, and had given up on my life. Two weeks before my 16th birthday, I was removed from my parents’ custody and placed under the custodianship of the hospital. I lived there for nearly 18 months. </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When I got out of the hospital, my therapist encouraged me to try yoga. I was still significantly underweight and terrified of people, but I went... only to discover a practice (and community) that changed my life. I went from surviving to thriving; from living half a life to experiencing joy and freedom I never imagined possible. Over the past six years, I’ve developed a program called Yoga for Eating Disorders™ based on my experience. I offer it in hopes that others, too, can recover their lives from this disease.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Chances are you know someone with an eating disorder. Maybe it’s a daughter, maybe it’s a friend, maybe it’s an ex-lover or spouse. An <a href=""http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/eating-disorders-statistics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s2"">estimated 24 million Americans suffer</span></a> from eating disorders, but only 1 in 10 ever receive treatment. This disease kills nearly half a million people every year - it has the <a href=""http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/eating-disorders-statistics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s2"">highest mortality rate of any mental illness</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I used to believe that no one recovered from an eating disorder. Every person I knew who had struggled with this disease was <em>still struggling, </em>recovery seemed hopeless and impossible. But now I know: Freedom is possible. Joy is possible. There <em>is</em> a way out of this illness, and yoga is an incredible tool in paving the path to healing. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">My goal is to help other women find their way out of this illness -- just like my community helped me in my time of need. I am partnering with the <a href=""http://www.givebackyoga.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Give Back Yoga Foundation</a> to offer Yoga for Eating Disorders™ as a service at treatment centers and to conduct an evidence-based study on its effectiveness in improving treatment outcomes.  Please support our campaign. </span></p>

<p class=""p1"">Yoga for Eating Disorders™ is a 3-day program that teaches patients practical tools to cope with difficult emotions, tune into hunger and fullness signals, and ultimately use yoga to support their recovery rather than act out in their eating disorder.</p>

Watch live here.


When I was 15 years old, I nearly died from a stroke caused by severe anorexia. I was 58 pounds, severely depressed, and had given up on my life. Two weeks before my 16th birthday, I was removed from my parents’ custody and placed under the custodianship of the hospital. I lived there for nearly 18 months. 
When I got out of the hospital, my therapist encouraged me to try yoga. I was still significantly underweight and terrified of people, but I went... only to discover a practice (and community) that changed my life. I went from surviving to thriving; from living half a life to experiencing joy and freedom I never imagined possible. Over the past six years, I’ve developed a program called Yoga for Eating Disorders™ based on my experience. I offer it in hopes that others, too, can recover their lives from this disease.
Chances are you know someone with an eating disorder. Maybe it’s a daughter, maybe it’s a friend, maybe it’s an ex-lover or spouse. An estimated 24 million Americans suffer from eating disorders, but only 1 in 10 ever receive treatment. This disease kills nearly half a million people every year - it has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. 
I used to believe that no one recovered from an eating disorder. Every person I knew who had struggled with this disease was still struggling, recovery seemed hopeless and impossible. But now I know: Freedom is possible. Joy is possible. There is a way out of this illness, and yoga is an incredible tool in paving the path to healing. 
My goal is to help other women find their way out of this illness -- just like my community helped me in my time of need. I am partnering with the Give Back Yoga Foundation to offer Yoga for Eating Disorders™ as a service at treatment centers and to conduct an evidence-based study on its effectiveness in improving treatment outcomes.  Please support our campaign. 
 



Yoga for Eating Disorders™ is a 3-day program that teaches patients practical tools to cope with difficult emotions, tune into hunger and fullness signals, and ultimately use yoga to support their recovery rather than act out in their eating disorder.

 
 


 
For every $5000 raised, we can offer the program at one treatment center in the United States.
Your funds support travel, lodging, data collection, curriculum development, support staff, materials, and related expenses.
Your funds will also allow me to visit one high school and one college in the hosting city to speak to young people about eating disorder prevention.
The sky is the limit. 50K is minimum. The more money we raise, the greater our potential impact.

After suffering a long time with gender identity problem, I find the right answer: I want to be a lady and be attracted to ladies. I want to be a fem! Living in a conservative family didn't allow me to even think about my real identity. Now that I have more independence from my family, and have more freedom from internalized transphobia, I feel relief by saying: I want to be a lady and live with another lady! </p>
<p>Since last October, I've started the work of transitioning from male to female. I need to raise funds for my surgery treatments. I am continuing my psychotherapy and facial hair removal. I am taking a sperm storage and starting hormones. I need to pay for my doctors visits, sperm storage, medications, hormones, lab tests, etc. Unfortunately, those treatments are not covered by insurance.</p>
<p>My surgery treatments take about twenty month. It takes eight months to develop the breasts and remove the facial hair.  It also takes such amount of time to have the body fat and hair changed to a more feminine appearance. Then, I have to live as a woman full time for a year to get permission for sex reassignment surgery.</p>
<p>I must pay $750.00 for facial hair removal.  </p>
<p>I must pay $2000.00 for three years of sperm storage to Pacific Reproductuve Services in Pasadena, California.</p>

<p>I must pay an average of $120.00 per sessions to my endocrinologist every month. I also have to pay $100.00 a month for my hormones injections and/or patches. The lab tests for hormone level and liver levels will cost an average of $200.00 every three months.</p>
<p>I must pay more than $10,000 for my surgery.</p>
<p>The supplemental expnenses are for a wig, extra psychiatric treatments, etc.</p>
<p>Your donations will not only help me but also the growth of the transexual community through more recognition and support.</p>

<p>The stage is set for the paradigm shift to take place, but we need a safer, milder, more widely-avaiable product - something that will make its way into classrooms and workplaces and 7-11's and gas stations across the globe! </p>
<p>A movement gets built one person at a time - so if you've been looking for something like this, please keep reading, share with a friend, and join us in helping make this a reality!</p>
<p>We started from scratch 6+ months ago and have put a ton of thought into developing the right product: something that you feel comfortable using, something that helps you hit your full mental potential, something that's convenient, attractive and affordable.<br/></p>
<h3>Ingredients.</h3>
<p>So what's in SPRINT? </p>
<p>One of our main ingredients is<b> L-theanine</b>, which has some interesting effects when coupled with caffeine, which is also an ingredient of SPRINT. Found in small amounts in tea, L-Theanine is known to ""promote a state of relaxation without causing drowsiness."" <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11434-014-0529-6#page-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">[4]</a></p>
<p><b> What if you could be relaxed yet alert? </b><br/></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p>
When you think of your ideal productive mindstate when studying or working, it probably looks <b>nothing like a Red Bull commercial</b>. Stuff like Red Bull and 5 Hour Energy and Starbucks gets you amped, but we all know that too much energy can be stressful and therefore counter-productive.</div>
<div>
<p><b>Being in the zone means feeling cool and in control. </b></p>
<br/><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1185259/files/20150130145016-Science.jpg?1422658216"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<span style=""font-style: normal;""> <b>""In particular, L-theanine and caffeine in combination appear to improve, significantly, aspects of memory and attention to a greater extent than caffeine alone...

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond L-theanine &amp; caffeine, SPRINT has a short list of ingredients, all FDA-approved and targeted to improve energy, clarity, and flow. We think it's important to be fully transparent, so we have no ""proprietary blends"" and you can see our formula below:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Caffeine </b>(100mg) - Same amount as in a 6 oz cup of coffee.</li>
<li>
<b>L-theanine</b> (200mg) - Pairs well with caffeine to enhance core cognitive abilities, see above. <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11434-014-0529-6#page-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[4]</a>

</li>
</ul>
<div>We definitely encourage you to read the studies linked above. All of our ingredients are FDA-approved for over-the-counter supplementation. The FDA is conservative in what it labels as safe for human consumption, because their job is to protect the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of ingestible goods sold to the public. <p></p>
<h3>Packaging</h3>
</div>
<p>Form follows function, as they say. </p>
<p><b>The packaging should not be an afterthought. </b></p>
<p>We iterated through <strike>dozens</strike> hundreds of packaging designs, and ran them by friends &amp; strangers for opinions.</p>
<p>Here's what we found out: </p>
<p>Convenience is king. People want something that slides into your pocket. People want something clean, modern, and small. Something that fits in next to their wallet, keys, and cell phone and other necessary daily items. Something that feels good, something that you can identify with.</p>
<p><b>Good design should omit everything superfluous, leaving only the essential.</b></p>
<p></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1210573/files/20150210005524-Packaging.jpg?1423558524"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>We have two options. Option 1 is an small, stocky, clear glass bottle, made of nice thick glass that feels perfect in your hands, and contains exactly 10 capsules of SPRINT. </div>
<div>Option 2 is a team supply, which contains 20 packs in a nifty dispenser - perfect for the office or kitchen. It's a ""gravity dispenser,"" meaning that when you take out a pack, the next one slides into place. Each pack is similar to Dentyne Ice or other gums where you pull off the sleeve and pop out a SPRINT. It's about 2"" x 3"" and easily fits in your pocket.</div>

<h3>Too Good To Be True?</h3>
<p>Hasn't this been done before? </p>
<p>No, not really. That's why we're here, doing this. Nobody else has actually put the pieces together, making something safe &amp; effective with well-designed packaging, messaging, and branding. Ask yourself this: <b>Why isn't there a name brand smart drug available in 7-11 next to the chewing gum? </b>That's the question that got us started.</p>
<p>How we spend our time, our limited number of hours in the day, matters now more than ever. It's an exciting time to be alive. Movies like Limitless and Lucy are total fictionalizations, but they touch a nerve because the promise of a better mind is truly exciting, and something we have been seeking for millennia.</p>
<p>This paradigm shift isn't going to happen on its own. We need your help to make it happen!<br/></p>
<p>As a special gift to you, we're making a limited edition shirt that's only available for people who support our Indiegogo campaign. <b>This shirt won't be available after the campaign!</b> Get em while they're hot - they're guaranteed to be a collector's item.</p>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>If we succeed in making nootropics commonplace, it will be the next chapter in humankind's ongoing stride towards self-improvement.</p>

<p>The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and our first step is a production run where we need a minimum run of $10k. We work with an FDA-approved manufacturing partner (who we've worked with previously. They produce vitamin supplements for a variety of premium brands. In order to have our product made in their state-of-the-art facility, we need to meet their minimum order quantity of $10k. There is no maximum to how much we can supply.<br/></p>
<p>100% of any profit we see on this campaign will go into the next production run, and then the next. We're on a mission, and you can say you helped kick off the movement!</p>
<p>Our main perks are the product themselves, as well as really cool posters and a limited number of super high quality shirts (have we mentioned we're obsessed with details &amp; design?)</p>

<h3>Why Us?</h3>
<p>Geoff and I have been friends since going to college at Stanford, where we both studied Computer Science. We've scored 99th %ile on the big 4 tests: ACT, SAT, GRE, and GMAT.<b> We know how to work and excel in some of the most challenging, demanding, and exciting academic environments in the world.</b> </p>
<p>By senior year in college, I was teaching public speaking and computer science classes to other undergraduates; Geoff was doing advanced research into distributed systems, which he eventually turned into a company that he and his team successfully sold in 2013. While Geoff was working on his first startup, I was working at Google as a product manager. After Geoff sold his company, he became an Entrepreneur in Residence at one of Silicon Valley's top venture capital firms, where I then joined him and we began working together. We became fascinated by nootropics, and got to work on building a nootropics company like no one has ever seen.</p>
<p>Our company is called <a href=""www.nootrobox.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nootrobox</a>, and SPRINT is our second product line. Our first product, RISE, is meant as a daily cognitive supplement that's beneficial when you take it habitually, whereas SPRINT is for an immediate boost when it's time to get the job done.</p>

A Brief History of Smart DrugsOne of the oldest known cognitive enhancers, caffeine, was used by Ethiopians a millennium ago - they would grind it up with lard for a quick snack to promote alertness. [1]
Fast forward a thousand years to the present. To say caffeine is available on every corner would be an understatement. THC (marijuana) is known to relieve psychological stress and enhance a creative mindset. LSD and psilocybin (found in mushrooms) have been used to treat psychological disorders and unlock transcendental thought patterns.[2] Prescription drugs like Adderall have been developed to help people with cognitive impairments, and healthy adults also take these to help with cognition.
Widespread use of smart drugs aka ""nootropics"" is the next paradigm in human advancement, a cousin to discoveries like the electric light-bulb, airplanes, modern medicine, the Internet, and other means of advancing our own ingenuity as a human species.
We are on the cusp of smart drugs being completely commonplace, if only there was an option that was safe, accessible, and widely accepted. 
 ""If an alien were looking at humanity and asking ""What is human nature?"" one of the ingredients [would be] that these beings seem quite concerned with improving their capacities and they seem to have a knack for doing it.""  [3]

The Present: The War on Adderall


Adderall is a rough ""proof of concept"" of a nootropic, but it misses the mark. Adderall, an amphetamine initially designed to treat people diagnosed with ADHD or narcolepsy, is in a heydey of popularity. It's used on a widespread basis on college campuses and in workplaces across the nation, despite the fact that it's a prescription drug, and buying/selling it casually is a crime in the US, punishable by prison. [4]


The premise of Adderall is exciting: pop a pill and plug in. However, two major issues set it back from becoming truly mainstream:



Physically risky - The ingredients in Adderall are overkill for many people who use it off-prescription: it's too powerful, too addicting, and has too many negative withdrawal issues. 


Unlevel playing field - Adderall is out of reach to many, which puts many at an unfair disadvantage. It's prescription, it's expensive, and it's traded illegally (largely among affluent people with little to fear from the law).



Adderall has not been developed specifically for the kind of cognitive enhancement it is often used for: everyday use by healthy adults.
We can do better than Adderall. With your help, we are leading the next step forward for cognitive supplements. Something that's legal, affordable, and safe. Something that's a supplement, not a prescription drug. Something that can benefit everyone.

Why is the most popular nootropic in America an expensive prescription drug that's widely bought and sold on the black market? Can there be something safe, effective, and as accessible as a pack of gum?
SPRINT: Leveling the Playing Field

Access to cognitive supplements should be freely available, like toothpaste or Tylenol, not just limited to those who are willing to take risks, spend big bucks, or buy on the black market.
In designing SPRINT, over 3/4ths of people we talked to said they'd be interested in using nootropics if the right option was made available.



The stage is set for the paradigm shift to take place, but we need a safer, milder, more widely-avaiable product - something that will make its way into classrooms and workplaces and 7-11's and gas stations across the globe! 
A movement gets built one person at a time - so if you've been looking for something like this, please keep reading, share with a friend, and join us in helping make this a reality!
We started from scratch 6+ months ago and have put a ton of thought into developing the right product: something that you feel comfortable using, something that helps you hit your full mental potential, something that's convenient, attractive and affordable.
Ingredients.
So what's in SPRINT? 
One of our main ingredients is L-theanine, which has some interesting effects when coupled with caffeine, which is also an ingredient of SPRINT. Found in small amounts in tea, L-Theanine is known to ""promote a state of relaxation without causing drowsiness."" [4]
 What if you could be relaxed yet alert? 

When you think of your ideal productive mindstate when studying or working, it probably looks nothing like a Red Bull commercial. Stuff like Red Bull and 5 Hour Energy and Starbucks gets you amped, but we all know that too much energy can be stressful and therefore counter-productive.

Being in the zone means feeling cool and in control. 



 ""In particular, L-theanine and caffeine in combination appear to improve, significantly, aspects of memory and attention to a greater extent than caffeine alone... The combination [of Caffeine & L-theanine] was associated with an improved ability to focus attention, whilst caffeine alone lead to an improvement in basic response speed or accuracy but not both.""[5]


Beyond L-theanine & caffeine, SPRINT has a short list of ingredients, all FDA-approved and targeted to improve energy, clarity, and flow. We think it's important to be fully transparent, so we have no ""proprietary blends"" and you can see our formula below:



Caffeine (100mg) - Same amount as in a 6 oz cup of coffee.

L-theanine (200mg) - Pairs well with caffeine to enhance core cognitive abilities, see above. [4]


Inositol (185mg) - An anxiolytic (anxiety inhibitor). [6][7]


Vitamins B6 (20 mg) and B12 (1mg) - Increases cell metabolism & aid in production of vital neurotransmitters. Provides an energy boost. [8][9]


Glucuronolactone (185 mg)- Causes increase in levels of naturally-occurring glucuronides, which bind with toxic substances and remove them from the body. [10]


We definitely encourage you to read the studies linked above. All of our ingredients are FDA-approved for over-the-counter supplementation. The FDA is conservative in what it labels as safe for human consumption, because their job is to protect the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of ingestible goods sold to the public. 
Packaging

Form follows function, as they say. 
The packaging should not be an afterthought. 
We iterated through dozens hundreds of packaging designs, and ran them by friends & strangers for opinions.
Here's what we found out: 
Convenience is king. People want something that slides into your pocket. People want something clean, modern, and small. Something that fits in next to their wallet, keys, and cell phone and other necessary daily items. Something that feels good, something that you can identify with.
Good design should omit everything superfluous, leaving only the essential.




We have two options. Option 1 is an small, stocky, clear glass bottle, made of nice thick glass that feels perfect in your hands, and contains exactly 10 capsules of SPRINT. 
Option 2 is a team supply, which contains 20 packs in a nifty dispenser - perfect for the office or kitchen. It's a ""gravity dispenser,"" meaning that when you take out a pack, the next one slides into place. Each pack is similar to Dentyne Ice or other gums where you pull off the sleeve and pop out a SPRINT. It's about 2"" x 3"" and easily fits in your pocket.


Check out the perks for all the ways to get this!

Too Good To Be True?
Hasn't this been done before? 
No, not really. That's why we're here, doing this. Nobody else has actually put the pieces together, making something safe & effective with well-designed packaging, messaging, and branding. Ask yourself this: Why isn't there a name brand smart drug available in 7-11 next to the chewing gum? That's the question that got us started.
How we spend our time, our limited number of hours in the day, matters now more than ever. It's an exciting time to be alive. Movies like Limitless and Lucy are total fictionalizations, but they touch a nerve because the promise of a better mind is truly exciting, and something we have been seeking for millennia.
This paradigm shift isn't going to happen on its own. We need your help to make it happen!
As a special gift to you, we're making a limited edition shirt that's only available for people who support our Indiegogo campaign. This shirt won't be available after the campaign! Get em while they're hot - they're guaranteed to be a collector's item.




Our Goal
If we succeed in making nootropics commonplace, it will be the next chapter in humankind's ongoing stride towards self-improvement.
We have the vision, we have the plan, we have the momentum. All we need is you!


The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and our first step is a production run where we need a minimum run of $10k. We work with an FDA-approved manufacturing partner (who we've worked with previously. They produce vitamin supplements for a variety of premium brands. In order to have our product made in their state-of-the-art facility, we need to meet their minimum order quantity of $10k. There is no maximum to how much we can supply.
100% of any profit we see on this campaign will go into the next production run, and then the next. We're on a mission, and you can say you helped kick off the movement!
Our main perks are the product themselves, as well as really cool posters and a limited number of super high quality shirts (have we mentioned we're obsessed with details & design?)


Why Us?
Geoff and I have been friends since going to college at Stanford, where we both studied Computer Science. We've scored 99th %ile on the big 4 tests: ACT, SAT, GRE, and GMAT. We know how to work and excel in some of the most challenging, demanding, and exciting academic environments in the world. 
By senior year in college, I was teaching public speaking and computer science classes to other undergraduates; Geoff was doing advanced research into distributed systems, which he eventually turned into a company that he and his team successfully sold in 2013. While Geoff was working on his first startup, I was working at Google as a product manager. After Geoff sold his company, he became an Entrepreneur in Residence at one of Silicon Valley's top venture capital firms, where I then joined him and we began working together. We became fascinated by nootropics, and got to work on building a nootropics company like no one has ever seen.
Our company is called Nootrobox, and SPRINT is our second product line. Our first product, RISE, is meant as a daily cognitive supplement that's beneficial when you take it habitually, whereas SPRINT is for an immediate boost when it's time to get the job done.
Our Progress
SPRINT is made in a state-of-the-art cGMP audited FDA factory in the United States. We have worked with our production facility in the past, and they are extremely professional. We have a firm grip of the timeline, we know the ins-and-the-outs of the supply chain and production process.



With your help, we will seal the deal and this will be in your hands in the first half of 2015. Our steps to get there:

Identify a state of the art, FDA compliant factory.
Finalize packaging design (finalize artistic direction, UPC barcode, nutrition facts labeling)
Purchase ingredients.
Test raw materials for purity.
Manufacture the pills.
Test final pills for purity and correct dosages of each ingredient. Produce a CoA (Certificate of Analysis).
Manufacture the packaging (concurrent with #3-6 above)
Package
Ship to you!

Shout It Out!
Do you have a friend who'd be curious about something like this? A classmate or colleague who uses Adderall? Someone who's preparing to take a big test like the SAT, GMAT, or MCAT?
Spread the word, and you can help make this a reality! Check us out on instagram and twitter for updates. 
Questions?Don't be shy! We're all ears, super honest, and we think about this stuff all day long. We'd love to hear from you.

<h2><b>FAQ</b></h2>
<h3><b>About product usage</b></h3>
<p>Q1.
How to turn Modoo on?  </p>
<p>A:
Modoo doesn’t have a power button. It is switched on by default and senses the
status of wearer automatically. When placed it on the mother’s stomach, Modoo
starts monitoring work at the present frequency. Its working status and data
output can be accessed on the App through Bluetooth connection whenever needed.</p>
<p>Q2. How can moms find the position of the babys’ heart?</p>
<p>A：Open the  App,
activate “Heartbeat search”, and move Modoo slowly on your belly; the  App will alert you when the right position is
detected; keep the patch in the position to start monitoring.</p>
<p>Q3. How to charge Modoo? </p>
<p>A: Modoo charges wirelessly. To start charging, simply place it on the
wireless charging base.</p>
<p>Q4. Intermittent
wear and continuous wear, which way is better for monitoring effectiveness? </p>
<p>We recommend
continuous wear that can collect more complete data and information. So mothers-to-be
can receive notifications at anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>Q5. Do you
recommend mothers-to-be wear Modoo when sleeping?</p>
<p>Yes, we do.
Firstly, this way will ensure the completeness of monitoring. Secondly, Modoo
will collect more precise information and data at quiet night. </p>
<p>Q6. Will
monitoring information and data be saved? How long will them be saved?</p>
<p>Yes. After
Modoo sending monitoring information and data to server, personal health
information and data will be connected with personal accounts and be saved.
Users can log in their personal accounts to check the monitoring information
and data.</p>
<p>Q7. May I log
in the same account on different smart devices?</p>
<p>Yes. But you
cannot log in the same account on different smart devices simultaneously. Our App
is compatible on any smart devices with iOS 7 and above and Android 4.3 and
above.</p>
<p>Q8. May I
record the sound of my baby’s heartbeat?</p>
<p>Yes. Open the
App and stay at “fetal heart monitoring” page, then Modoo can record and save
the sound of baby’s heartbeat. Mothers-to-be can listen it at anytime and
anywhere.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>About product safety</b></h3>
<p>Q1. What is
“passive monitoring”?</p>
<p>We do not send
signal to mothers’ body. It’s more like that we are carefully listening baby’s
heartbeat and collecting baby's heart rate and movement by ears.</p>
<p>Q2. Will Modoo
radiate mothers’ body or babies?</p>
<p>No. Modoo is
using passive monitoring technology, thus, there is no signal transmission.</p>
<p>Q3. Is modoo
Water proof?</p>
<p>Yes, it is.
Modoo is composed of medical-grade stainless steel. It not only is water proof,
but also is preventing from sweat erosion.</p>
<p>Q4. Is the

<p>The silicone
paste is the 3M medical-grade, which can be multiple-use. The specific use time
depends on different users.</p>

#investinyourhealthImprove your wellbeing by improving your indoor air qualityThe sensor within WiCub 2 can detect a broad range of gases to measure air quality for personal well being. Gases that can be detected include Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) from paints (such as formaldehyde), lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning supplies, furnishings, office equipment, glues, adhesives and alcohol.  WiCub 2 at home...I always thought the air in my home was clean; it seemed clean as there were no smells.And then one day I brought WiCub 2 home and he was not a happy chappy...I could not understand why, when the air seemed just fine; but obviously WiCub 2 was sensing much more than what my nose could.Then I opened some windows...Half an hour later WiCub 2 was much happier.Even though there was no smell inside the home, there was a build of VOCs that I could not detect that was easily resolved simply by ventilating.WiCub 2 is so easy to use that even my 7 year old tells me if WiCub 2 is not happy.The beauty about WiCub 2 is that it is constantly monitoring my home and sends out a daily email report. Here's one for my bedroom:Got a humidity alert when the pressure dropped and the rain come pouring down...Using the data from WiCub 2, I can now make informed decisions that will improve not only mine but also my family's well being.I hope you will invest in your health and live healthy. WiCub 2 in a planeWiCub 2 with it's 40+ day battery life and small size, makes it truly portable.On a recent trip, WiCub 2 shows what the air quality is really like in an aeroplane.Explains why we also feel like that after a long flight.Third Party IntegrationsIf you'd like WiCub 2 to send data to your own server, then you can easily do this by specifying your own custom endpoint URL during setup.Data is sent in JSON format that can easily be parsed by your web service.Also available is an option to use a third party web platform called IoTpool (separate charges may apply) Delivery - January 2020We aim to deliver WiCub 2 in January 2020. We have already completed an initial production run and whilst the campaign is running we will be finalising firmware, testing & packaging.Every crowd funding project has a degree of risk to it.

<p>I'm a long term traveller, a big time dreamer, fairytale believer, magic maker, medicine woman…the list is infinite ;)</p>
<p>The last few years has taken me to Europe, India, Africa, North America, Central America and finally my last destination. I'm trying to find a way to reconcile this inner longing to live a spiritual life with sustaining myself with the basic necessities…i.e. food, shelter, community. It's proving possible so far by living day to day on very little means offering my time and energy in communities in return for board and stay.</p>
<p>I've been practicing yoga since 2012 and its become an intrinsic part of my daily life. This connection that it provides is the only thing that seems to make sense. It has saved me from depression and given me perspective on purpose. I have long been studying and practicing but now feel it is time to take it to the next step - get certified as a yoga teacher so that I can share with others what I love along the way.</p>
<p>How can you help me? By helping me complete my yoga teacher training, you will be helping me complete my longer term vision that a friend and I are working on now. We are traveling to accumulate all the knowledge we need but sometimes you need certifications to proof that you have what's already there. You will help me share this passion with others and hopefully inspire them for connection to their divine inner selves. </p>
<p>If you can help even a little bit, I will be eternally grateful. So much love. Keep dancing along the spiral!</p>

<h3>Where we began.</h3>
<p>In 2011, while sitting at the Claim Jumper Restaurant in Carlsbad, CA with my girlfriend Shelly, I came up with the idea for Metamorphosis Travel.</p>
<p>We wanted to launch a business accompanying depressed and stressed individuals on trips around the world. We believe that if someone who is stressed out on life, they will gain perspective on a trip somewhere out of their familiar environment. A mental vacation where they wouldn't have to be anywhere at any time. One that we would make adventurous, and from time to time even a little dangerous. One where they can truly leave behind the world that they are accustomed to with it’s high tech connectivity, depressing debt and domestic problems.</p>
<h3>What would we do?</h3>
<p>We are both credentialed healthcare professionals, with a psych background. . Metamorphosis Travel can help people fully understand that there is more to life than the way they are accustomed. We can educate them with the precious knowledge that there are people all over the world that are happy, doing much less with minimal resources. We teach people there is a world view out there and a larger perspective. A WORLD PERSPECTIVE. Get back to basics, and live life on a daily level.</p>
<p>People for 1000's of years, up until the early 1900s, were dependent on daily living and the need to provide for themselves and their family. Everyone had a place in society, and everyone worked every day to make it to the next. They didn't plan much more than 24 hours ahead of time. This basic life strategy has been lost in our current world. So much so that we become self-absorbed and purposeless. We are now just individuals that march along to the beat of our own drums and own survival with little regard for others let alone our intuition.</p>
<h3>How do we do it?</h3>
<p>We feel that it is through daily living and planning we achieve a sense of purpose in a day-to-day life. We feel that we can learn by travel. If we can live every day, one day at a time... we develop a sense of self purpose. There were many times while traveling the world when we followed our intuition, be it Shelly’s or mine. We acted on it and we followed it daily. We experienced more and did far more than we would have ever hoped to do by planning the trip. Life just took us along.</p>
<p>This can be a reality for people who are having issues with life. Now days we are too concerned about the future, and worrying about it incessantly and un-necessarily. We need to live our life day-to-day and live every day as if we only have another day to live. What would you be doing if you knew you had one more day to live?</p>
<p>We would like to teach people the realizations we've developed while traveling the world. I would like others to have the opportunity to go on a month to six-week mental health vacation. Whether it’s Central America, South America or Southeast Asia, the metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly might transform your life as it did ours.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> Why the campaign?</h3>
<p>We would use the money to advertise in large psychology and travel magazines, both online and in print.  This is astronomically expensive and for two nurses with a travel addiction, we simply don't have the money to get this off the ground except with our website and social media.  Yes we need help, but more so we want to help others.  This mission is to transform lives as we do on a daily basis at work through travel experiences.  This is a dream we are embarking on.  We don't know if it work or not. However if there are enough people who believe in this, we will make an incredible impact on people's lives.  </p>

It is held weekly at Renaissance Presbyterian Church in the Westside community and regularly hosts 18-25 people. This program provides an opportunity for
intergenerational learning, builds reading skills, and creates a forum to
practice public speaking. The sisters also provide and prepare a meal for all participants. All of this is open
to the public and is completely free. This year, they have decided to expand the program into a full summer camp.<br/><br/>A recent NY Times article found that <b>27
percent of the Chattanooga's residents and 42 percent of children live below the
poverty line</b>, nearly double the national and statewide average, respectively.
Finding affordable, safe childcare throughout the summer can be extraordinarily
difficult.
Additionally, the Westside is situated within a food desert which means that
the access to healthy and affordable food for children throughout the year, but particularly throughout the the summer is
limited. <br/><br/>In an effort to help meet both of these needs, the summer
camp will be held each weekday from June 2 until July 25 and will provide two healthy
meals and a snack, all <b>free of charge</b>. Throughout the year, the children
participating in the literacy program have helped to plant and tend to a
community garden and will continue to do so throughout the summer. In addition,
there will be a continuation of literacy development, cultural heritage and
civic engagement programs, arts, crafts, and music. Mrs. Gloria and Ms. Phyllis also plan to
incorporate a mentorship program between teenagers and children which will provide community teens with an avenue to grow in their understanding of the value
of volunteerism and community.

<p>People from throughout the country come to Chattanooga which has been heralded at one of the great tourist destinations of the United States. But for many of the Westside community children – <i>children who
live within sight of the mountain which houses tourist attractions such as Rock
City and Ruby Falls, and who are within five minutes of the Tennessee Aquarium
</i>- access to local attractions is restricted. Mrs. Griffith and Ms. Phyllis
would really love to facilitate the opportunity for them to go to places such
as the Creative Discovery Museum, the Bessie Smith Hall, the Nature Center, and
Lake Winnie. In addition, a Chattanooga neighborhood center is
offering swimming lessons this summer and the children have been signed up for
once weekly lessons for five weeks. <br/></p><p>Unfortunately, these experiences aren't free. In order to take the approximately 30 children who will be attending summer camp, we will need to raise <b>AT LEAST $1000</b>. This does not include the cost of transportation! Every $10, $20, and $50 donation helps one or several of these amazing children have an experience which so many people take for granted.</p><p>If you give <b>$10</b>, you have helped <b>two six year old girls</b> go to the Creative Discovery Museum and dig for dinosaur bones, create music, and learn about electricity. Maybe<b> they'll grow up</b> to be an archeologist, a singer, or an engineer based off of what they're able to do this summer.</p><p>If you give <b>$20</b>, you have given an <b>eight year old boy</b> the opportunity to go to Lake Winnie at the end of the summer. He will have six hours of complete fun and will create life-long memories with his friends.</p><p>If you give <b>$50</b>, you have paid admission for nearly <b>half of the camp</b> to go to the Bessie Smith Hall and to learn about the Empress of the Blues who was born in their very own community!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p><b>Volunteer:</b> This camp will be completely operated by volunteers.

<h2><b style=""font-size: 30px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;background-color: initial;"">Our Story</b></h2>
</div><p>Over a year ago, a team of 5 physicians, scientists and engineers set out to create a new kind of wearable device. This device would leverage the power of two of nature’s fundamentals: <b>light</b> and <b>thermal energy </b>and their effect on the body.</p><p>This device would not simply measure your heart rate or other common fitness metrics like most other wearables do today. Rather, it would enable anyone to <b>optimize their body’s function</b> by simply using light and cold to ultimately <b>revolutionize human performance</b>.</p><p>In June of 2015, the Quantlet made its debut during the keynote speech at the <a href=""https://vimeo.com/140447404"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Voice &amp; Exit 2015</a> conference by <b>Dr. Jack Kruse</b>, one of the Quantlet's inventors. Dr. Kruse is a respected Neurosurgeon and author of the book <i>Epi-paleo Rx: The Prescription for Disease Reversal and Optimal Health</i>. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454195663/xuaejc1kytqdkmv2rjsx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>There, Dr. Kruse shared his findings and explained just how he lost 133 pounds and packed on muscle in a matter of months. More importantly, he also discussed <b>why he used light and cold</b> to achieve his impressive results. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""281"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/140447404"" width=""500""></iframe></div><b> </b><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Specifically, Dr. Kruse revealed how the Quantlet uses a technique called <b>p</b></span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">hotobiomodulation</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> to deliver multiple frequencies of light into the body to achieve remarkable physical results. That’s a big word, so let’s break it down into its component parts:  </span></p><h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>PHOTO = Light. BIO = Life. MODULATION = Change. </b></h4><p>The effects of photobiomodulation were discovered over 40 years ago and have since been studied at such prestigious institutions as Harvard and NASA.</p><p>Photobiomodulation has a <b>photochemical effect</b> (much like photosynthesis in plants).

</h4><p>In multiple studies conducted across the globe in countries such as Germany, Russia, China, and Brazil, investigators have long noted that when using specific frequencies and intensities of light for the irradiation of blood, subjects in those studies have shown <b>improvements in lipid levels, cholesterol, blood sugar, clotting and immunity. </b></p><p>Strikingly, in Sports Medicine in particular, photobiomodulation has demonstrated increased exercise capacity and longer exercise times, as well as improved biomarkers (including reduced lactate, creatine kinase, and CRP) after exercise in athletes treated with red and infrared light. </p><p><b>...and, as if that wasn't enough</b>...</p><p>It has also been reported to release certain brain compounds that positively affect mood and sleep.</p><p>For example, the Italian researchers Raggi and Vallesi published a groundbreaking study in athletes in which they investigated the <b><a href=""http://www.laser-akupunktur.info/pdf/06_raggi_valles.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">effect of blood irradiation on strength and endurance</a></b>.<a rel=""noopener nofollow"">[1]</a> </p><p>Published in the German journal “Schmerz &amp; Aupunktur"" in 2008, the study's authors found that athletes demonstrated remarkable physiologic benefits, including <b>increasing their exercise performance by over 20% in multiple exercise categories</b> from just 10 days of blood irradiation. </p><p>What's more interesting is that they observed these <b>effects lasted for 16 weeks after the end of the treatment</b>!

Why does that matter?</p><div> <h4 style=""text-align: center;"">As it turns out, physical and mental functions are impaired when your body’s core temperature increases or you get hot</h4>
<p>That is why<a href=""http://www.exercisemed.org/research-blog/precooling-to-optimize.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <b>more and more athletes are using cold</b></a> to produce a performance-enhancing effect during short and intense resistance exercises.</p>
<p>However, research of the effects of local cooling on muscle function during exercise has produced<b> <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cooling+athletic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inconsistent findings</a></b>. This is likely due to the different locations and strategies being used for cooling, which range from the use of cold water or ice baths, cold drinks, gel cold packs, as well as very wildly varied timing and duration of cooling.</p>
<p>More importantly, the conventional cooling methods most people are using are typically applied to the skin’s surface. Because of that, they are <b>generally ineffective</b> at cooling the body’s core and key organs like the brain.</p>
<p>This is because they don’t penetrate through the body’s insulating layers of tissue. Worse than that, the <b>cold itself can result in vasoconstriction</b> of the peripheral blood vessels and actually cause the opposite effect rather than the desired one.  </p>
<p>But, everyone from <b>Olympic trainers</b> all the way through to the<b> military’s Special Forces </b>have pushed researchers to find better and more consistent ways to cool the body. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Some of these researchers have been successful</b></p>
<p>For example, researchers at Stanford University successfully demonstrated that heat can be extracted from the body core through the palm of the hand. They accomplished this through the use of a specialized glove that uses a vacuum to negate the effect that cold has on <b>vasoconstriction.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""281"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8J6ov48rG0"" width=""500""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>A challenge that remained, however, was the practicality of the device design given its size, weight and configuration. </p>
<p><b>We thought we could find a better way to achieve similar results…and we did. </b></p>
<p>Early test results indicate that the Quantlet’s novel, patent-pending configuration achieves most of the benefit of hand cooling <b>without the use of a vacuum-assisted glove</b>.</p>
<p>Instead, the Quantlet achieves these results by<b> simply extracting heat through the skin of the wrist</b>. While the thermal conductivity of skin varies, the Quantlet achieves heat transfer rates approximating those observed at Stanford through a much more practical wearable design.</p>
<p>The Quantlet’s Cooling Module uses electronic components called thermoelectric coolers (TECs) that leverage something known as the <b>Peltier effect</b>. By using a solid-state electronic mechanism to cool the body, our team removed the need for any cooling fluids and <b>minimized the device's footprint</b>.</p>
<p>Further, the<b> Quantlet's Lighting Module stimulates vasodilation through the localized release of nitric oxide</b> (NO) by irradiating the placement site with appropriate light frequencies. So, it does not need a vacuum pump either! This feature has the bonus effect of systemically releasing NO and enhancing oxygen uptake by helping blood vessels dilate and improving blood flow. </p>

<p>Through the Quantlet’s specially designed heat-sink and cooling fan, the device achieves remarkable TEC efficiency, enabling its cooling surface to reach low enough temperatures to provide an extremely powerful heat exchange, <b>even when operating in relatively high temperature environments</b>. </p>
<p>Our experiments with the Quantlet’s multiple iterations also helped us make improvements in the Cooling module’s heat exchange plate design and the Light module’s most optimal LED placement, power density and light frequency set to maximize the synergistic effect of <b>Light &amp; Cold</b> on your body.</p>

<p>This is your chance to contribute directly to <b>revolutionizing fitness and wellness</b>. But you have to exercise your vote to change human performance. One at a time, each one of your contributions can be a powerful force in enabling us to realize this technology's great potential.</p>
<b>Technology and day-to-day testing</b><p>The Quantlet is an innovative breakthrough product combining different disciplines such as photobiomodulation, thermo-electric cooling, electrical and mechanical engineering, wiring, software development, physiology and sport science. We want to provide all who are as fascinated with improving their physical performance as we are, the best possible equipment in terms of quality, design and ergonomics.</p>
<p>We want our products to be usable in different environments and we are hence conducting <b>rigorous testing</b> under different conditions. We have allowed time for the tests in our plans. Nevertheless, we run the risk of prototype testing being carried out in-house identifying software or hardware bugs resulting in required adjustments and thus leading to delivery delays. </p>
<p><b>Safety</b></p>
<p>Photobiomodulation and thermo-regulation are proven and hazard-free technologies, which are widely supported by multiple studies. Despite this, we are committed to ensuring that our products comply with the highest quality and safety standards and are safe to use. </p>
<p>Providing maximum performance and reliability to our customers may result in design improvements that can be made and which may create unforeseen delivery delays.</p>
<p><b>Certifications</b></p>
<p>The delivery of the Quantlet is subject to certain certifications in specific markets. We are implementing a quality management system that supports the timely implementation of all appropriate procedures. We are familiar with the respective requirements and are supported by a dedicated team intimately familiar with international certification procedures for similar devices.</p>
<p>The certification process for Europe, the US and other relevant markets will begin once the final design is locked down in early 2016. We will also obtain our FCC certificate for Bluetooth communication and will complete CE Certification.</p>
<p>The delivery of products in Europe is, therefore, planned to start in mid to late 2016. International shipments will take place after the appropriate clearance from the relevant government bodies has been received. Even though we are confident that we are well prepared to handle the respective processes, we cannot eliminate the risk of delays due to compliance issues.</p>
<p><b>Supply Chain Risks</b></p>
<p>The Quantlet is a complex device with multiple custom components. While we have dedicated team members covering sourcing and supply chain, delays may occur if we face longer than expected lead times in the delivery of said components.</p>
<p>This is our first foray into consumer products - and we want to get it right. We know how to develop a product, we know how to manufacture it and we know how to distribute it.  We now simply need your help to improve our original design even faster and take the Quantlet to the next level.</p>
<p>That is why we are asking some of our early contributors to be a part of our Beta program. Early testers will receive a Beta version of the product to test and give us feedback. So, help us change human performance forever by participating in this campaign and getting in early to be one of the first to get a Quantlet.</p>
<p>Many of you have commented on our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/quantlet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""target_blank"">Facebook page</a> how exciting you find the invention of the Quantlet.  We are gratified by the reaction and your enthusiasm to join us in our effort.</p>
<p>You have asked some good and important questions. This FAQ page will start to answer these questions and hopefully give you a deeper understanding of what we’ve done and what we plan to do. Our goal is to keep you informed and motivated to help us realize this revolutionary improvement in human performance on Indiegogo.</p>
<p><b>What is the Quantlet and how does it work?</b></p>
<p>The Quantlet is a patent-pending wearable device in the form of a flexible bracelet that applies light and cold through the skin of the wrist and ultimately to the blood. </p>
<p>Using a proprietary set of wavelengths and duration of irradiation parameters developed by Quantum Dynamics, the device emits light through the skin and tissue down to the radial and ulnar arteries, as well as the wrist veins. The light applied triggers targeted, localized and controllable production of nitric oxide, a well-known vasodilator and neurotransmitter capable of enhancing physical performance by increasing blood flow. </p>
<p><b>Nitric oxide has also been known to reduce inflammation and trigger gene expression</b>. </p>
<p>In addition, the Quantlet utilizes thermoelectric coolers (TECs) to regulate core body temperature thereby optimizing physiologic performance. A specially designed heat-sink and cooling fan enables the device to achieve remarkable TEC efficiency, enabling its cooling surface to reach low enough temperatures to become an extremely effective heat exchanger for the body, even in relatively hot operating environments. </p>
<p><b>How do I wear the Quantlet?</b></p>
<p>The Quantlet is designed to be worn on the wrist and is sized appropriately to fit both men and women of average size.  <b>We are experimenting with a band-extender to enable the use of the Quantlet’s light module on different parts of the body. </b>Details for this feature are not yet available.</p>
<p><b>How long can I wear the Quantlet?</b></p>
<p>The Quantlet is designed to be worn between 5 and 60 minutes per day. Typically, users will wear the Quantlet for 30 minutes pre-exercise to maximize exercise efficiency and 60 minutes post-exercise to enhance recovery. </p>
<p>There are extended use programs available for flight and sleep modes.  The Quantlet’s mobile app will notify you when it’s time to remove it after a protocol is completed.</p>
<p><b>Will the Quantlet be comfortable when worn on the wrist, especially when exercising?</b></p>
<p>We have designed, built and tested our design’s test housing in multiple scenarios, including exercise. This test housing allowed us to simulate the size and weight of the proposed completed device. Various designs were evaluated and this one far outweighed the rest.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, we wanted a lot from the Quantlet’s design. We wanted it to be wearable during exercise and comfortable enough to allow the user to fall and stay asleep while wearing it, while the device remained in place even through the night.</p>
<p>After a number of iterations, we arrived at a design that accomplishes all of these goals.</p>
<p>Without comfort, we knew we'd have nothing. The wrist interface is molded from a soft and pliable medical-grade silicone material. Its shape provides a gentle and flexible seal for the light and the cold being produced by the device. To assure accurate fit and maximum comfort, the device is intended to be worn by both men and women of average size.</p>
<p>Our test subjects indicated they found the device comfortable enough to fall asleep and stay that way until a normal awakening, such as going to the bathroom. At which time the device could remain in place until they returned to bed. Upon waking in the morning, they removed the device and rated their experience.</p>
<p>Continued adjustments in the shape and materials have further improved retention and comfort.</p>
<p>We plan to continue optimizing the design and minimizing the Quantlet’s size and weight after the Indiegogo campaign is completed and larger studies are performed.</p>
<p><b>Where does the Quantlet’s name come from?</b></p>
<p>The name Quantlet comes from the devices’ roots in quantum physics, specifically….the photoelectric effect. This was first discovered by Hertz, and then later the theory of light put forth by Einstein.</p>
<p>According to the photoelectric effect, when light strikes any material substance, electrons are discharged, creating a current. More simply stated, light interacts with matter as the energy of the light is transferred to that matter’s electrons. In 1905, Einstein offered an explanation for this phenomenon for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p><b>How much is shipping?</b></p>
<p>Shipping is free to the US.  International orders will require an additional contribution for shipping on top of the amount paid for the Perk (please see the details listed in each of the Perks).</p>
<p><b>What is the Quantlet’s warranty?</b></p>
<p>The Quantlet is backed by a 1-year limited manufacturer's warranty. We are dedicated to your complete satisfaction. If you have any problems at all, simply contact our Support team at info@quantlets.com and we will make it right.</p>
<p><b>Is the battery rechargeable or does it need to be replaced?</b></p>
<p>The Quantlet has a rechargeable battery and its duration before recharge will vary depending on the program being used. Recharging the Quantlet will take about 60 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Can I swim/shower/immerse the Quantlet in water?</b></p>
<p>The device is designed to be water-resistant (but not waterproof) and carry an IP rating similar to that of other ruggedized devices. It’s important to highlight, though, that the device is currently meant to be worn before exercise, between sets and/or after workouts. We are conducting extensive testing to ensure we understand precisely how the device will enhance exercise during workouts. </p>
<p><b>Why do I need this thing? Why can’t I just put my hand in an ice bucket or use any other red or infrared light source?</b></p>
<p>The Quantlet is carefully designed to provide just the right power and frequency of light along with the right amount of cold to maximize the photobiomodulation, vasodilation and cooling effects. Using any other light source would likely yield too much, too little or the wrong kind of light onto your body. Simply submersing your hand in cold water would create vasoconstriction in your hand and make cooling down more difficult.</p>
<p><b>What does wearing the Quantlet feel like?</b></p>
<p>The Quantlet creates a mild cooling sensation at the wrist that is almost imperceptible when the body is overheated. Its effects, however, are quick and noticeable. Generally, an overall sense of well-being and feeling “refreshed” follows its use.</p>
<p><b>Can I work-out less because I use the Quantlet?</b></p>
<p>The Quantlet will never replace exercise and conditioning. It will simply help you maximize your exercise efficiency and speed up your recovery times. </p>
<p><b>Is the Quantlet a medical device?</b></p>
<p>No. The Quantlet is intended for consumer use only and is not a medical device. It is a fitness and wellness product to be used by healthy adults wanting to exercise more efficiently. In a medical overheating emergency, one should seek proper medical attention immediately. </p>
<p><b>What physiologic parameters does the Quantlet track, if any?</b></p>
<p>Skin temperature for now. In the future, it may track others.</p>
<p><b>Why is the Quantlet funding itself through Indiegogo crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p>As many of you know, we have chosen the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo to raise the necessary funds to finalize our production-ready design of the Quantlet. Many of you have asked why we didn't go the more traditional routes like venture capital, selling the company, or finding other investors.</p>
<p>The short answer is this: We carefully considered all of our options. We chose Indiegogo over other options because crowdfunding is the best way to align the needs of our company and its innovative device with the interests of those of its end-users. </p>
<p><b>For International backers, does my shipping fee cover duties/taxes?</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, no. Like any other purchase from a retailer based in the US, we will ship as a commercial product with an invoice and any resulting duties are the responsibility of the backer. The fees collected via Indiegogo only cover the shipping fees per se.</p>
<p><b>What is the product warranty provided?</b></p>
<p>The Quantlet has a limited 90-day warranty that exclusively covers manufacturing defects. The device must be used in accordance to manufacturer instructions as included in the User Manual found here <a href=""https://thequantlet.com/setup"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://thequantlet.com/setup</a></p>
<p>The product warranty does NOT cover damage by the user such as broken bands, early battery failures from usage multiple times per day, and other similar circumstances.</p>
<p>The product warranty is not transferable if the device is resold or its ownership transfered to someone other than the individual placing the original order.</p>

Our Story
Over a year ago, a team of 5 physicians, scientists and engineers set out to create a new kind of wearable device. This device would leverage the power of two of nature’s fundamentals: light and thermal energy and their effect on the body.This device would not simply measure your heart rate or other common fitness metrics like most other wearables do today. Rather, it would enable anyone to optimize their body’s function by simply using light and cold to ultimately revolutionize human performance.In June of 2015, the Quantlet made its debut during the keynote speech at the Voice & Exit 2015 conference by Dr. Jack Kruse, one of the Quantlet's inventors. Dr. Kruse is a respected Neurosurgeon and author of the book Epi-paleo Rx: The Prescription for Disease Reversal and Optimal Health.   There, Dr. Kruse shared his findings and explained just how he lost 133 pounds and packed on muscle in a matter of months. More importantly, he also discussed why he used light and cold to achieve his impressive results.   Specifically, Dr. Kruse revealed how the Quantlet uses a technique called photobiomodulation to deliver multiple frequencies of light into the body to achieve remarkable physical results. That’s a big word, so let’s break it down into its component parts:  PHOTO = Light. BIO = Life. MODULATION = Change. The effects of photobiomodulation were discovered over 40 years ago and have since been studied at such prestigious institutions as Harvard and NASA.Photobiomodulation has a photochemical effect (much like photosynthesis in plants). One of the main mechanisms of action occurs inside mitochondria, the energy power plant inside every cell. Photobiomodulation's effects depend on the application of the appropriate wavelength and density of light, delivered to the target tissues for a specific period of time.Most of the scientific evidence for photobiomodulation has focused on its impressive effects on tissue repair (skin wounds, muscle, tendon, bone, nerves), but also on how it reduces inflammation and eradicates pain wherever light of particular characteristics is applied. (PubMed refs)According to peer-reviewed scientific literature, light acts at the cellular level by stimulating cells to generate more energy and utilize oxygen more effectively. Within certain blood-based cells exist mitochondria, which produce cellular energy in the form of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate or ATP for short. An enzyme in mitochondria known as cytochrome c-oxidase (CCO) utilizes light's photons to increase ATP and reduce oxidative stress. A cascade of mitochondrial and intracellular downstream effects then lead to astounding results including tissue repair and reduced inflammation. (Pubmed refs)
What Has Been Largely Missed Is That Photobiomodulation Can Also Enhance Athletic Performance
In multiple studies conducted across the globe in countries such as Germany, Russia, China, and Brazil, investigators have long noted that when using specific frequencies and intensities of light for the irradiation of blood, subjects in those studies have shown improvements in lipid levels, cholesterol, blood sugar, clotting and immunity. Strikingly, in Sports Medicine in particular, photobiomodulation has demonstrated increased exercise capacity and longer exercise times, as well as improved biomarkers (including reduced lactate, creatine kinase, and CRP) after exercise in athletes treated with red and infrared light. ...and, as if that wasn't enough...It has also been reported to release certain brain compounds that positively affect mood and sleep.For example, the Italian researchers Raggi and Vallesi published a groundbreaking study in athletes in which they investigated the effect of blood irradiation on strength and endurance.[1] Published in the German journal “Schmerz & Aupunktur"" in 2008, the study's authors found that athletes demonstrated remarkable physiologic benefits, including increasing their exercise performance by over 20% in multiple exercise categories from just 10 days of blood irradiation. What's more interesting is that they observed these effects lasted for 16 weeks after the end of the treatment! The researchers hypothesized that this duration had to do with the mean lifetime of red blood cells, which is about 12-15 weeks.    So, we decided to leverage these findings and put them on a wrist device that would enhance compliance with its use By irradiating the skin on the wrist to reach the blood non-invasively, we hypothesized that we could achieve the same or at least similar results to those reported by these scientists, including improvements in sports performance and physical, mental disposition and even sleep quality.We used red and infrared LEDs to obtain a photobiomodulating effect just as powerful as the invasive intravenous method effect used by researchers by leveraging the so-called ""optical window"" in tissue, which allows light to penetrate the skin most effectively. And, we also used LEDs in the violet, blue and green range. There are three main reasons for the light frequency sets that the Quantlet uses: (i) the NADH-complex absorbs light in the blue range, (ii) blue and green light has an effect on HEME within red blood cells and (iii) these frequencies promote light-mediated vasodilation.[2] This will become more important as you keep reading...Again, the science can get pretty thick, but what matters is that we are using the body's own capacity to perform at its best by giving it two forms of energy it can use: Light & Cold....But that’s not all the Quantlet will do…The Quantlet is also designed to actively cool your blood. Why does that matter? As it turns out, physical and mental functions are impaired when your body’s core temperature increases or you get hot
That is why more and more athletes are using cold to produce a performance-enhancing effect during short and intense resistance exercises.
However, research of the effects of local cooling on muscle function during exercise has produced inconsistent findings. This is likely due to the different locations and strategies being used for cooling, which range from the use of cold water or ice baths, cold drinks, gel cold packs, as well as very wildly varied timing and duration of cooling.
More importantly, the conventional cooling methods most people are using are typically applied to the skin’s surface. Because of that, they are generally ineffective at cooling the body’s core and key organs like the brain.
This is because they don’t penetrate through the body’s insulating layers of tissue. Worse than that, the cold itself can result in vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels and actually cause the opposite effect rather than the desired one.  
But, everyone from Olympic trainers all the way through to the military’s Special Forces have pushed researchers to find better and more consistent ways to cool the body. 
Some of these researchers have been successful
For example, researchers at Stanford University successfully demonstrated that heat can be extracted from the body core through the palm of the hand. They accomplished this through the use of a specialized glove that uses a vacuum to negate the effect that cold has on vasoconstriction.

A challenge that remained, however, was the practicality of the device design given its size, weight and configuration. 
We thought we could find a better way to achieve similar results…and we did. 
Early test results indicate that the Quantlet’s novel, patent-pending configuration achieves most of the benefit of hand cooling without the use of a vacuum-assisted glove.
Instead, the Quantlet achieves these results by simply extracting heat through the skin of the wrist. While the thermal conductivity of skin varies, the Quantlet achieves heat transfer rates approximating those observed at Stanford through a much more practical wearable design.
The Quantlet’s Cooling Module uses electronic components called thermoelectric coolers (TECs) that leverage something known as the Peltier effect. By using a solid-state electronic mechanism to cool the body, our team removed the need for any cooling fluids and minimized the device's footprint.
Further, the Quantlet's Lighting Module stimulates vasodilation through the localized release of nitric oxide (NO) by irradiating the placement site with appropriate light frequencies. So, it does not need a vacuum pump either! This feature has the bonus effect of systemically releasing NO and enhancing oxygen uptake by helping blood vessels dilate and improving blood flow. 

Through the Quantlet’s specially designed heat-sink and cooling fan, the device achieves remarkable TEC efficiency, enabling its cooling surface to reach low enough temperatures to provide an extremely powerful heat exchange, even when operating in relatively high temperature environments. 
Our experiments with the Quantlet’s multiple iterations also helped us make improvements in the Cooling module’s heat exchange plate design and the Light module’s most optimal LED placement, power density and light frequency set to maximize the synergistic effect of Light & Cold on your body.
 
 
Impossible? Science Fiction?
 
Science, yes. Fiction, no. The Quantlet leverages medical research and well-established science in the fields of photobiomodulation, physiology and sports medicine coming from respected institutions including Harvard and Stanford.
 

 


But, WHO Exactly Will Benefit The Most From The Quantlet?
The Quantlet is ideal for those men and women who are looking for a wide-variety of benefits that have to do with their personal health and mental/physical performance including…
 

MMA Fighters
Cross-Fit Athletes
Rock Climbers
Weight Lifters
Runners

But the Quantlet also works well for both “everyday” men and women who simply want a way to boost their energy, overcome chronic fatigue, improve sleep, and reduce their recovery times.
 


The great thing about using the Quantlet for either improving mental/physical performance or for simple health reasons, is that it’s SUPER EASY to use and is completely painless. 
Plus, the Quantlet provides a quick and easy way to WORK NATURALLY WITH YOUR BODY to maximize your results to help you reach your weight loss or performance goals once and for all. 
 
 
“Ok, Where’s The PROOF That The Quantlet Really Works?”

As you’ve probably seen by now, there’s all types of health devices on the market promising amazing results and breakthrough “cures” to all sorts of issues. But the thing is, 99% of these devices have absolutely NO type of real backing or research (and proven results!) to back them up. 
They are more hype than anything else to make a quick buck…
The Quantlet is different. It not only leverages the PROVEN medical research and well-established science in the field of photobiomodulation, sports medicine and natural physiology from some of the most respected institutions in the world.


 


“Now’s Your Chance To Let The Quantlet SKYROCKET Your Personal Performance and Overall Health…”
If you think about all the costs and hours you put in to gain that “competitive edge” or to improve your own personal strength (and even weight loss), it can add up quickly. When you consider the costs for gym memberships, supplements, diets, and the toll it takes on your personal time…it can all add up to well over $2000 or even way more. 


Now with the Quantlet, you’ll have ONE single device that can not only help you achieve personal performance levels unlike you’ve ever seen, but also help you feel your best at the push of a single button. 
One device = One completely transformed body with accelerated performance levels!
And now you can get your hands on your very own Quantlet device for a fraction of what many photobiomodulation devices costs. Plus, it’s much easier to use and implement in your everyday life than any other device on the planet.
In conclusion...


Thanks for looking! If you love the Quantlet, or just love to see the entrepreneurial spirit thrive, please help us get this amazing project off the ground. 
Every $1 helps ... and telling people really helps, too. 
Thank you for checking out the Quantlet.

Technology and day-to-day testingThe Quantlet is an innovative breakthrough product combining different disciplines such as photobiomodulation, thermo-electric cooling, electrical and mechanical engineering, wiring, software development, physiology and sport science. We want to provide all who are as fascinated with improving their physical performance as we are, the best possible equipment in terms of quality, design and ergonomics.
We want our products to be usable in different environments and we are hence conducting rigorous testing under different conditions. We have allowed time for the tests in our plans. Nevertheless, we run the risk of prototype testing being carried out in-house identifying software or hardware bugs resulting in required adjustments and thus leading to delivery delays. 
Safety
Photobiomodulation and thermo-regulation are proven and hazard-free technologies, which are widely supported by multiple studies. Despite this, we are committed to ensuring that our products comply with the highest quality and safety standards and are safe to use. 
Providing maximum performance and reliability to our customers may result in design improvements that can be made and which may create unforeseen delivery delays.
Certifications
The delivery of the Quantlet is subject to certain certifications in specific markets. We are implementing a quality management system that supports the timely implementation of all appropriate procedures. We are familiar with the respective requirements and are supported by a dedicated team intimately familiar with international certification procedures for similar devices.
The certification process for Europe, the US and other relevant markets will begin once the final design is locked down in early 2016. We will also obtain our FCC certificate for Bluetooth communication and will complete CE Certification.
The delivery of products in Europe is, therefore, planned to start in mid to late 2016. International shipments will take place after the appropriate clearance from the relevant government bodies has been received. Even though we are confident that we are well prepared to handle the respective processes, we cannot eliminate the risk of delays due to compliance issues.
Supply Chain Risks
The Quantlet is a complex device with multiple custom components. While we have dedicated team members covering sourcing and supply chain, delays may occur if we face longer than expected lead times in the delivery of said components.
This is our first foray into consumer products - and we want to get it right. We know how to develop a product, we know how to manufacture it and we know how to distribute it.  We now simply need your help to improve our original design even faster and take the Quantlet to the next level.
That is why we are asking some of our early contributors to be a part of our Beta program. Early testers will receive a Beta version of the product to test and give us feedback. So, help us change human performance forever by participating in this campaign and getting in early to be one of the first to get a Quantlet.

Our goal is to keep you informed and motivated to help us realize this revolutionary improvement in human performance on Indiegogo.
What is the Quantlet and how does it work?
The Quantlet is a patent-pending wearable device in the form of a flexible bracelet that applies light and cold through the skin of the wrist and ultimately to the blood. 
Using a proprietary set of wavelengths and duration of irradiation parameters developed by Quantum Dynamics, the device emits light through the skin and tissue down to the radial and ulnar arteries, as well as the wrist veins. The light applied triggers targeted, localized and controllable production of nitric oxide, a well-known vasodilator and neurotransmitter capable of enhancing physical performance by increasing blood flow. 
Nitric oxide has also been known to reduce inflammation and trigger gene expression. 
In addition, the Quantlet utilizes thermoelectric coolers (TECs) to regulate core body temperature thereby optimizing physiologic performance. A specially designed heat-sink and cooling fan enables the device to achieve remarkable TEC efficiency, enabling its cooling surface to reach low enough temperatures to become an extremely effective heat exchanger for the body, even in relatively hot operating environments. 
How do I wear the Quantlet?
The Quantlet is designed to be worn on the wrist and is sized appropriately to fit both men and women of average size.  We are experimenting with a band-extender to enable the use of the Quantlet’s light module on different parts of the body. Details for this feature are not yet available.
How long can I wear the Quantlet?
The Quantlet is designed to be worn between 5 and 60 minutes per day. Typically, users will wear the Quantlet for 30 minutes pre-exercise to maximize exercise efficiency and 60 minutes post-exercise to enhance recovery. 
There are extended use programs available for flight and sleep modes.  The Quantlet’s mobile app will notify you when it’s time to remove it after a protocol is completed.
Will the Quantlet be comfortable when worn on the wrist, especially when exercising?
We have designed, built and tested our design’s test housing in multiple scenarios, including exercise. This test housing allowed us to simulate the size and weight of the proposed completed device. Various designs were evaluated and this one far outweighed the rest.
As you can imagine, we wanted a lot from the Quantlet’s design. We wanted it to be wearable during exercise and comfortable enough to allow the user to fall and stay asleep while wearing it, while the device remained in place even through the night.
After a number of iterations, we arrived at a design that accomplishes all of these goals.
Without comfort, we knew we'd have nothing. The wrist interface is molded from a soft and pliable medical-grade silicone material. Its shape provides a gentle and flexible seal for the light and the cold being produced by the device. To assure accurate fit and maximum comfort, the device is intended to be worn by both men and women of average size.
Our test subjects indicated they found the device comfortable enough to fall asleep and stay that way until a normal awakening, such as going to the bathroom. At which time the device could remain in place until they returned to bed. Upon waking in the morning, they removed the device and rated their experience.
Continued adjustments in the shape and materials have further improved retention and comfort.
We plan to continue optimizing the design and minimizing the Quantlet’s size and weight after the Indiegogo campaign is completed and larger studies are performed.
Where does the Quantlet’s name come from?
The name Quantlet comes from the devices’ roots in quantum physics, specifically….the photoelectric effect. This was first discovered by Hertz, and then later the theory of light put forth by Einstein.
According to the photoelectric effect, when light strikes any material substance, electrons are discharged, creating a current. More simply stated, light interacts with matter as the energy of the light is transferred to that matter’s electrons. In 1905, Einstein offered an explanation for this phenomenon for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize.
How much is shipping?
Shipping is free to the US.  International orders will require an additional contribution for shipping on top of the amount paid for the Perk (please see the details listed in each of the Perks).
What is the Quantlet’s warranty?
The Quantlet is backed by a 1-year limited manufacturer's warranty. We are dedicated to your complete satisfaction. If you have any problems at all, simply contact our Support team at info@quantlets.com and we will make it right.
Is the battery rechargeable or does it need to be replaced?
The Quantlet has a rechargeable battery and its duration before recharge will vary depending on the program being used. Recharging the Quantlet will take about 60 minutes.
Can I swim/shower/immerse the Quantlet in water?
The device is designed to be water-resistant (but not waterproof) and carry an IP rating similar to that of other ruggedized devices. It’s important to highlight, though, that the device is currently meant to be worn before exercise, between sets and/or after workouts. We are conducting extensive testing to ensure we understand precisely how the device will enhance exercise during workouts. 
Why do I need this thing? Why can’t I just put my hand in an ice bucket or use any other red or infrared light source?
The Quantlet is carefully designed to provide just the right power and frequency of light along with the right amount of cold to maximize the photobiomodulation, vasodilation and cooling effects. Using any other light source would likely yield too much, too little or the wrong kind of light onto your body. Simply submersing your hand in cold water would create vasoconstriction in your hand and make cooling down more difficult.
What does wearing the Quantlet feel like?
The Quantlet creates a mild cooling sensation at the wrist that is almost imperceptible when the body is overheated. Its effects, however, are quick and noticeable. Generally, an overall sense of well-being and feeling “refreshed” follows its use.
Can I work-out less because I use the Quantlet?
The Quantlet will never replace exercise and conditioning. It will simply help you maximize your exercise efficiency and speed up your recovery times. 
Is the Quantlet a medical device?
No. The Quantlet is intended for consumer use only and is not a medical device. It is a fitness and wellness product to be used by healthy adults wanting to exercise more efficiently. In a medical overheating emergency, one should seek proper medical attention immediately. 
What physiologic parameters does the Quantlet track, if any?
Skin temperature for now. In the future, it may track others.
Why is the Quantlet funding itself through Indiegogo crowdfunding?
As many of you know, we have chosen the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo to raise the necessary funds to finalize our production-ready design of the Quantlet. Many of you have asked why we didn't go the more traditional routes like venture capital, selling the company, or finding other investors.
The short answer is this: We carefully considered all of our options. We chose Indiegogo over other options because crowdfunding is the best way to align the needs of our company and its innovative device with the interests of those of its end-users. 
For International backers, does my shipping fee cover duties/taxes?
Unfortunately, no. Like any other purchase from a retailer based in the US, we will ship as a commercial product with an invoice and any resulting duties are the responsibility of the backer. The fees collected via Indiegogo only cover the shipping fees per se.
What is the product warranty provided?
The Quantlet has a limited 90-day warranty that exclusively covers manufacturing defects. The device must be used in accordance to manufacturer instructions as included in the User Manual found here https://thequantlet.com/setup
The product warranty does NOT cover damage by the user such as broken bands, early battery failures from usage multiple times per day, and other similar circumstances.
The product warranty is not transferable if the device is resold or its ownership transfered to someone other than the individual placing the original order.

Hello my name is Shawntel Patterson. I am a sophomore. I play tennis; it is one of my biggest passions. That is why I started this campaign.  I am also very dedicated to what I do. I live in a household that consists of my father and I .I’ve been living with my father since I was 5 month old. 4 years ago my father was injured; and is slowly trying to recooperate, he is now on permanent disability. My mother is deceased, so we don’t have the funds to enter enough tennis tournaments or pay for tennis lessons. But my father does all that he can to help. When i become a professioinal tennis player i would like to give back to the less fourtunate.

<p>We have a friend, Emily, a very special friend to all of us and right now she needs not only our help, but your help as well.</p>
<p>Five and a half years ago she was diagnosed with breast cancer and decided to follow an alternative path of healing. She valiantly embarked upon an extraordinary journey that led her to writing a book called 'Cancer Healed Me' which is one of the most positive books you can read on the subject!<br/><br/> This in turn, led her to travel and give talks on healing. Not only does Emily say that the cancer healed her mind, but you can actually see it - she's full of light, humour and a bundle of laughter. Her positive energy and grace blows away all her friends.</p>
<p>However, this week our friend Emily discovered that the cancer has spread to her bones.<br/><br/> Emily, who has so little fear, believes in quality of life not quantity and so is committed to 'dancing to the light' with grace, dignity and laughter.  She has chosen to continue her gentle path of alternative healing as her body cannot cope with 'nuclear' medicine. Since she was diagnosed nearly six years ago, five of her friends who were also were diagnosed decided to heal with traditional medicine or 'chemotherapy' but they have all since passed on. And the doctors have said she should have passed on years ago too!  This makes Emily even more determined to continue to follow her unique path.</p>
<p><strong>WHY WE FEEL SHE DESERVES OUR HELP, AND YOURS</strong></p>
<p>It is expensive staying alive!! Emily has very little money. She has not worked for the past five years as she has dedicated her time to healing and researching cancer for her book. Yet her book only generates an income from Amazon of $.17 a copy.  And so far she's never been paid!</p>
<p>Yet despite this she has been inspired to write a new book called 'Follow Your Bliss, If Not What's The Point?'  It is her contribution to awakening people to follow their heart, for she believes this is the best preventative medicine ever.</p>
<p>Her imagination and creativity inspire all who meet her. Over the years she has created a home for adolescent mothers in Cusco, Peru – an incredible place that has won awards for the best women’s project in South America; a library in Nicaragua and a healing convent in France. She has raised funds for children in Africa and was instrumental in building a well in the jungle in Peru.</p>
<p>She is now contemplating the creation of a documentary to help people face death with more peace and acceptance. Her eighteen years of meditation practice has led her to being in a wonderful place of peace that could inspire others as they make their transitions to the light. And with me, she is still determined to help run retreats in Ibiza, assisting others to create changes in their lives and so live more fully and passionately.</p>
<p>She said the other day that she most definitely was not going to be sitting around thinking about bones and cancer but live passionately until the very end. So, she has decided to go with a friend to the Gerson Clinic in Hungary, which has an amazing reputation for healing cancer through a very special diet. This journey will cost 7,000 Euros and in typical Emily style she has booked her place for the second week of September trusting the universe will bring the funds to her account! </p>
<p>So you see, our friend Emily is no ordinary “cancer” victim – she believes she created this for her soul to grow.  Her vision on healing is inspiring and touches everyone who meets her. Now it is definitely her time to receive from us, and you!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE WISH TO MANIFEST FOR EMILY<br/></strong></p>
<p>Despite being faced with this latest challenge she has not lost her courage and is determined to keep creating and living to the very last breath she takes. </p>
<p>We need to help her financially and wish to raise $30,000 to pay for her alternative treatments and medicines, the rent for an apartment to live in, as she does not own a home, and all the other expenses that are involved in ""dancing to the light"".<br/><br/> It is not a fortune that we're asking for, but we wish to see our friend live out this passage with no extra stress so she can continue with her talks, finish her book and create her documentary.<br/><br/> Anything, anything at all you can contribute to our friend Emily would be wonderful.  Thank you in advance for your generosity and love.<br/><br/> If you need more information please feel free to contact me: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""mailto:Tristan@TristanSoames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tristan@TristanSoames.com</a></span></p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS MAVUNO HARVEST?</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.mavunoharvest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mavuno Harvest</a> is a new food company started by a Peace Corps volunteer who spent over 2 years living and working with a small farming community in rural Kenya.  The idea was to try something new - step outside of the world of traditional 'development,' yet still have a positive impact on the lives of impoverished rural African farmers.</p>
<p>The result - truly amazing, delicious and healthy dried fruits grown and cared for by small scale farmers.  We source everything from subsistence farmers whose only income comes from the land they cultivate.</p>

<p><strong>SO HERE'S THE DEAL:</strong></p>
<p>We already know this dried fruit is <strong>the tastiest</strong> on the market today.  Seriously.  Our customers love us and we even received glowing reviews from the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade (NASFT).  Plus, we already know that our dried fruit is a great healthy snack - <strong>full of energy</strong> - with absolutely <strong>nothing added</strong> - no sugar, no preservatives, no coloring.</p>
<p>What we need now is to add a few certifications to our fruit to truly make it the best we can.  The fruit is already grown organically, and our whole business model is based on helping farmers and treating them fairly.  So now we want to have the food <em>officially</em> certified for both organic and fair trade.  Unfortunately, this can get a bit expensive!</p>
<p>Getting these certifications will help us grow our market - and the more we grow our market, the more money will actually roll into the African farming communities responsible for these amazing snacks.  Think about it - its a great concept right?</p>

<p>Remember the tricorder from Star Trek? It's a multi-purpose sensor that, with a peripheral attachment, becomes a medical scanner. Now, we found a way to merge a transducer with any tab or even a phone, forming the first pen-sized ultrasound machine. The communicator meets the tricorder, at least within the limits of real-life technology.</p>
<p>Now we have a technology to build the ultra-low cost wireless ultrasound imager that can be connected to any tab, smartphone or computer to show images of an unborn baby on device's screen.</p>
<p>The pen-sized wireless device works in a similar way to existing ultrasound scanners, using pulses of high frequency sound to build up a images.</p>

<p>""It was my own experience of becoming a father and going through the whole antenatal process that prompted me to start the project,” explains the Andrey Fedorov, founder of ROXX.</p>
<p>“I was sat with my wife looking at our child on the screen, we realised how privileged we were to have access to this kind of care and it was my wife who suggested that I could apply my knowledge  to try to make this more affordable.”</p>

<p>UN statistics estimate more than 250,000 women die annually from complications during pregnancy or childbirth, almost all of them – 99 per cent – in developing countries.  Tragically, most of these deaths are avoidable and a lack of access to equipment is cited as one of the key factors.</p>

Remember the tricorder from Star Trek? It's a multi-purpose sensor that, with a peripheral attachment, becomes a medical scanner. Now, we found a way to merge a transducer with any tab or even a phone, forming the first pen-sized ultrasound machine. The communicator meets the tricorder, at least within the limits of real-life technology.
Now we have a technology to build the ultra-low cost wireless ultrasound imager that can be connected to any tab, smartphone or computer to show images of an unborn baby on device's screen.
The pen-sized wireless device works in a similar way to existing ultrasound scanners, using pulses of high frequency sound to build up a images.
ROXX control app will be available on Android, Apple IOS and Windows.
Our story
 
""It was my own experience of becoming a father and going through the whole antenatal process that prompted me to start the project,” explains the Andrey Fedorov, founder of ROXX.
“I was sat with my wife looking at our child on the screen, we realised how privileged we were to have access to this kind of care and it was my wife who suggested that I could apply my knowledge  to try to make this more affordable.”
Also our early stage prototype participated in Intel App innovation Contest (Intel AIC) and won a stage 2 prize!
ROXX at Medical Units
UN statistics estimate more than 250,000 women die annually from complications during pregnancy or childbirth, almost all of them – 99 per cent – in developing countries.  Tragically, most of these deaths are avoidable and a lack of access to equipment is cited as one of the key factors.
Imaging to obtain even the simplest information such as the child’s position in the womb or how it is developing is simply not available to women in many parts of the world:


* it is real image of unborn child acquired by ROXX prototype.ROXX can be used to provide medical units working in the world’s poorest nations with basic, antenatal information that could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children. 



ROXX at Home

ROXX can accurately measure fat thickness and calculate Body Fat % and weight distribution by analyzying ultrasound waves reflecting from your fat and muscles.For example, scanning with the ROXX allows you to directly see fat and muscle layers as shown below:
* it is real image of muscle and fat layers acquired by ROXX prototype.

Risks and Challenges
ROXX don't have the power and depth of a larger hospital grade machine, obviously, and in some cases doctors will want traditional scans. But this device's strengths are its portability and cost.

As a result, It's virtually impossible for anyone that works indoors to operate at their peak. Depression, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are at epidemic proportions and have all been shown to have links to sunlight deprivation. The resulting absenteeism, presenteeism and a general malaise in the workplace, as productivity demands continue to increase, has proven costly for employers and individuals alike.<p></p>

<li>
<b>The Only Effective Colored Wavelength -</b>The LifeLight delivers only therapeutically effective wavelength of light ~480nm (sky blue). It therefore operates at far less intensity while being more effective than any other solution. </li>
<li>
<b>Connected and Responsive App -</b>The LifeLight is the first app controlled, “Internet of things” (IoT) connected light therapy device and leverages a multitude of external sensor based inputs No other product has the ability to automatically incorporate outside variables and user dynamics that directly impact the amount of sunlight that is most effective for each individual user. </li>
<li>
<b>Customized Sunlight Algorithm -</b>By learning each user’s personal preferences the app algorithmically calculates the best amount of sunlight each and every day. </li>
<li>
<b>Reduces Light Pollution –</b>In an office environment filled with competing visual stimuli (monitors, overhead lighting, etc.) the LifeLight only adds the specific wavelength of light required and reduces visual stress. </li>
<li>
<b>Ergonomic Design -</b>Unlike other bulky and disruptive light therapy products it’s unique compact and flexible form factor was developed to direct the light down into the eye and out of the field of view, the way nature intended. Position the LifeLight to shine down from above your computer display and you'll receive all of the effective light energy without even noticing the LifeLight is there!</li>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1359686/files/20150406104211-FAQ.png?1428342131"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><ul>
<li>
<h4>My office has plenty of windows and lots of natural light...so I don't need a LifeLight, right?</h4>
<p>The LifeLight brings the sun indoors no matter what the weather, season or time of day. Although natural light from the sun is best, unless you are truly outside on a bright sunlit day, it’s unlikely you will receive the amount of colored light spectrum (sky blue or 480nm) necessary to bring the healthful benefits of the sun to you, no matter how many windows your home or office happens to have. The distinction we draw is in the physiological benefits gained by receiving the right amount of that sky blue light. Windows do vary in technology and makeup but invariably, the energizing benefits of sunlight are drastically reduced as the light passes through those windows. Add to that the further reduction in sunlight during less sunny days and the changing of the seasons. There is however, a psychological benefit of outdoor views through those same windows. Windows alone do not deliver nearly enough of the proper light to significantly impact human physiological wellness.<br/></p>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Will I get a tan by using the LifeLight?</h4>
<p>The LifeLight does not deliver any UV or near UV rays from which, exposure to the skin produces more melanin which rises to the surface and darkens the skin.<br/></p>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Will the LifeLight work for everyone even if they live in a sunny location?</h4>
<p>Yes. Science has shown that non-visual sensors in our eyes manage and control a complex sequence of events within all of us that balance “sleep / wake” hormones along with many other functions. These sensors are particularly responsive to the color of a bright sunlit sky (sky blue) and when exposed to those colors initiate those events making us healthy, happy, more energized and productive during the day. Those that work indoors during prime daylight hours are deprived of these life giving benefits from the sun. Today’s indoor lighting does not deliver nearly enough of the effective “sky blue” color to allow the body's sleep/wake regulation to occur properly no matter where we live. Even sitting next to a window does not allow nearly enough of that particular sky blue light to reach the eye with enough intensity to allow our bodies to work properly. The LifeLight changes that by bringing the sun’s life giving colors indoors in a smart, personal lighting system that is easy to use on or around any computer workstation.<br/></p>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Do you get vitamin D from the LifeLight?</h4>
<p>Not yet. The LifeLight does not deliver any UV or near UV rays from which the skin produces vitamin D. Our scientists and engineers are however, working on a safe and effective way to stimulate vitamin D production using our lamp. One day we expect to include this as another feature of our system.<br/></p>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<h4>How long should I use the LifeLight every day?</h4>
<p>The color, brightness and duration recommended for peak effectiveness varies from person to person and day to day. Variables such as weather, schedules, how restful your sleep was, how stressful the day has been, the day of the week, etc. are used by the LifeLight’s learning system and will help you find the optimum settings each and every day to achieve your personal best.<br/></p>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Is the LifeLight safe?</h4>
<p>The LifeLight is absolutely safe and can be infinitely adjusted for maximum comfort and performance.<br/></p>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<h4>What time of year should I use it?</h4>
<p>Those of us that work indoors, regardless of geographic location, will benefit by using the LifeLight year round.<br/></p>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Will the glare bother me?</h4>
<p>Unlike our competitors, the LifeLight can be positioned out of the field of view while still allowing the light to effectively enter the eye thereby eliminating glare.</p>

At Sun LifeLight, we've revolutionized light therapy by building smart, personal sunlight delivery systems specifically designed to be used at work, school or home by anyone that wants to operate at their peak!  
The system is uniquely designed to make it effective for use by computer using office professionals that spend most of their workday indoors. With this simple yet sophisticated and patent protected system, those that don't receive the energizing benefits of being in the sun while at work, can still gain those natural, energy amplifying, mood enhancing and productivity boosting attributes at or around their computer workstations!
 Corporations and individuals alike, benefit by virtually transporting their workstations to sun drenched destinations!

Computer-using office professionals, students and home based workers do not receive enough sunlight during the workday to maintain a healthy existence. As a result, It's virtually impossible for anyone that works indoors to operate at their peak. Depression, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are at epidemic proportions and have all been shown to have links to sunlight deprivation. The resulting absenteeism, presenteeism and a general malaise in the workplace, as productivity demands continue to increase, has proven costly for employers and individuals alike.

Please, find the following report from Thomas Jefferson University Department of Neurology, that succinctly explains how humans are ""wired"" to benefit from the sun. 
The simple solution: Bring the effective, soft, “sky blue” color of a bright sunny day to every workstation...The result, a happier, healthier and more productive workforce and or individual, within days.
A recent report by Shadab Rahman, PhD. from Brigham & Women's hospital Boston, MA shows how Sun LifeLight’s technology is at the forefront of this healthful, productivity boosting revolution.


About 20 months ago, we set off on a mission to bring the healthful benefits of the sun inside to help employers and employees alike, create healthy, exciting, energetic and productive work environments! 
Our journey began with a love for the outdoors and the constant desire to be in the sun. 
After months of research and development with an exceptionally talented team of technologists and medical professionals, we were able to deliver the LifeLight prototypes to an amazing collection of enterprise clients.

Those partners including TJX, BAE, Barclays, Digital Credit Union (DCU) and Todd & Weld, to name a few, provided valuable feedback that allowed us to optimize the production design. 
Now we need your help to make the LifeLight a production reality!
Through your support and backing of this IndieGoGo campaign, not only will you receive the first and only natural, energy boosting, personal, sunlight delivery system, but your support will help Sun LifeLight make this life changing system available to all that spend so much of their day indoors, no matter where they live!
Many of us continue to struggle through the worst winter on record (Boston, MA is in the midst of the snowiest winter in its long history)! We drew inspiration from these long dark days to ensure that although the harsh weather will inevitably return, thanks to the LifeLight, many of us will be basking in the healthful benefits of the sun no matter what the weather, season or time of day.


System Overview
Used as you would an ordinary desk lamp, this unique system allows users to interactively decide exactly how much sun they feel they need on a daily basis. A mobile application controls and monitors the light wirelessly, while the system actually gets smarter over time. Using its sophisticated algorithm, the app recommends the appropriate amount of sunlight each and every day based on a variety of inputs including weather, sleep quality, personal schedules and even favorite athletic team schedules.
LifeLight Touch...Stylish and Elegant Simplicity


High tech brushed aluminum desk lamp
Color selected LEDs
Controlled using simple swipes of a finger on a glass touchscreen panel built into the base
Infinitely adjust the brightness of the soft, sky blue light
Adjust the timer for up to 8 hours of use with a simple swipe of the finger
Uniquely flexible positioning system allows any user to direct the effective light into the eyes from above to eliminate glare, the way nature intended 
Integrated USB port in the base for charging of any mobile device

SunSeeker App...Sophisticated Utility

SunSeeker App Available Soon


Personalized Control and Monitoring Mobile App
Bluetooth connection to the LifeLight
Provides individually Customized, daily recommended sunlight levels for maximum benefit
Built with proprietary algorithm using Multiple Internet of Things (IoT) inputs such as:
 Weather

 Personal schedule
Athletic team schedules
Wearable device data such as sleep quality, etc.
Interactive algorithm learns each users optimum sunlight levels for peak performance





The Only Effective Colored Wavelength -The LifeLight delivers only therapeutically effective wavelength of light ~480nm (sky blue). It therefore operates at far less intensity while being more effective than any other solution. 

Connected and Responsive App -The LifeLight is the first app controlled, “Internet of things” (IoT) connected light therapy device and leverages a multitude of external sensor based inputs No other product has the ability to automatically incorporate outside variables and user dynamics that directly impact the amount of sunlight that is most effective for each individual user. 

Customized Sunlight Algorithm -By learning each user’s personal preferences the app algorithmically calculates the best amount of sunlight each and every day. 

Reduces Light Pollution –In an office environment filled with competing visual stimuli (monitors, overhead lighting, etc.) the LifeLight only adds the specific wavelength of light required and reduces visual stress. 

Ergonomic Design -Unlike other bulky and disruptive light therapy products it’s unique compact and flexible form factor was developed to direct the light down into the eye and out of the field of view, the way nature intended. Position the LifeLight to shine down from above your computer display and you'll receive all of the effective light energy without even noticing the LifeLight is there!

<p>The results of the secondary test lead his primary doctor to put him in contact with a surgeon, Dr. Kavada who then started his own workup and was informed by him that he needed his gallbladder removed, ASAP after which it was discovered that there damage to the bile ducts that were detached from the gallbladder .

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We all know how devastating cancer is and how hard is the fight to cure it, in all it's different forms. I myself feel, as I know most people do, when something happens to a child it is that much more tragic. NO child should have to face the horrors of cancer. And any parent will tell you there is no greater pain than the loss of a child. If there is a sadder sight than a child or teen without hair, lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to tubes I cannot think of it. It moves one to tears. I am not a parent and have not had this disease touch any young person in my family, immediate or otherwise, nor do I know anyone who personally lost a child to cancer. For this I am eternally grateful. But this has only served to deepen my committment to do my part to end childhood cancer, so no child or parent should have to suffer this ever again. Please help me make this a reality!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is $10,000. I did recent fundraisers for St Jude's Childrens Hospital and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and while I was glad to present them with checks for $1000 and $1500 respectively I really want to step up my goals now. I would love to present each of these wonderful organizations a check for $5000 each.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The work St Jude's has done for decades, after being founded by the late great Danny Thomas and carried on by his beautiful and talented daughter Marlo, has been extraordinary. NO child is ever turned away and the survival/cure rate is increasing every year! Their constant two-pronged approach of treatment and care combined with research has done wonders. But they will be the first to tell you there is so far to go.</p>
<p>The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society is relentless in it's quest to cure this particularly horrible form of cancer, which is the NUMBER ONE cancer that strikes children and young adults. Leukemia has been called the ""Child Killer"", and while great strides have been made so much more is to be done. The LLS is leading the way!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Anytime you can, please give to St Judes or the LLS. One can become a sponsor of a child for just $20/month at St Judes. Both organizations accept recurring monthly donations through credit card, bank account or paypal. And each can be added to a will for  one-time or monthly donation. Also, join their Facebook pages, send away for information, have a local fundraiser (both organizations will help you all the way from planning to the event itself) and any other way you can help raise money and even more importantly, awareness. Together we can defeat childhood cancer forever!</p>

<p><b>About Me</b></p>
<p>My name is Alex Foley. Currently, I'm a third
year Neuroscience BSc student at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK,
projected to achieve a first degree honours. During the past year, I have
developed a very close relationship with Prof. Louise Serpell, a professor of
Biochemistry at my university. She has generously supervised me for a summer
studentship in her lab following my second year and my third year project,
entitled, 'Investigating prion-like strains as the basis of phenotypic variation
in the tauopathies.' During these projects, Louise has given me invaluable
experience and a genuine passion for investigating Alzheimer's disease. </p>
<p>This being my final year of university, I have
been very keen to secure a position in a lab for next year. Louise has been so
kind as to offer me a position in her lab to carry out my PhD research, but
unfortunately she does not have enough funding to cover my
tuition. Originally, I'm from Maine in the US, which has some significant
implications for the cost of my PhD. Firstly, as I am not an EU citizen, the
tuition fees per year are £17,000 per year as opposed to the £3,996 an EU citizen would
pay, which totals £51,000. Secondly, I am not eligible for most forms of funding. Many UK based
organisations dictate that the funding they give out goes to UK citizens, and
the major sources of funding for US students in the UK stipulate that applicants
cannot have previously studied in the UK. Of course I am willing to take out
significant student loan debt in order to carry out this research, but this would leave me significantly worse off after I finished my degree. Any
amount of money donated would go directly towards tuition fees, allowing me to
take on less debt.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's research has truly become a
passion of mine during my undergraduate degree. I constantly find myself
blathering on about new journal articles I've recently read to my friends and
family. I hope to someday become a professor and carry out my own research, and this PhD would be the first step down this path. </p>
<p><b>About the Research</b></p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is a crippling,
progressive neurodegenerative disease that, with the ageing population, is
going to become a significant burden on the healthcare system. It is projected
to affect 115.4 million people worldwide by 2050, a staggering number that
demonstrates the urgent need for an effective treatment. What's more, anyone with a connection to the disease can attest
to the personal toll it takes on its sufferers and their loved ones. It is for
these reasons that the benefits Alzheimer's research is so crucial. I truly
believe that I am capable of significantly contributing to this research, given
the opportunity. Already in my undergraduate degree I have carried out research
that is now being included in a manuscript that David Sanders of Washington
University is submitting to the journal Neuron, a unique honour. I can think of
nothing more I would like to dedicate my life and career to more than the study
and eventual curing of this terrible degree.</p>
<p>Specifically, this PhD research would investigate
one of the two proteins involved in Alzheimer’s disease, tau. Under basal
condition, tau provides structural support to neurons via microtubule binding,
but in Alzheimer’s disease it becomes hyperphosphorylated and aggregates to
form neurofibrillary tangles. Recent work, including my dissertation, has shown
that there are a few key similarities between the tauopathies and a fascinating
set of diseases called the prionopathies, which include mad cow disease and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These similarities include spreading pathology and
phenotypic variation. My research would investigate the molecular basis of
these key characteristics of tau.</p>

As a community-based team, we do not have the support of a university to help fund our team so we are asking for your help!</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise money to subsidize our travel expenses to get to the Quidditch Canada National Championships in Vancouver, BC.  After placing 2nd in the Western Regional Championships, we are excited to bring our little team from the heart of the nation out to Nationals to show all the big players how we kick butt, Manitoba-style!</p>
<p>Quidditch is a trans-positive, inclusive sport and we pride ourselves on maintaining that inclusive spirit in everything we do both at home and abroad.  As part of our goal of inclusivity, we want to mitigate the affect that travel costs can have on anyone's ability to participate in our sport.  Anything you can spare to help us reach our goal will only help to grow and foster this spirit and this sport in Canada, and especially in Manitoba.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>As you may or may not know, Canada is really big,* and Winnipeg is literally in the middle making travelling exceptionally expensive for us, no matter where we go.  In considering our options for how to get to Nationals, we looked at driving, but a 24 hour road trip each way is not feasible for any of our players due to work, school and other commitments.  It would also significantly impact our competitiveness to spend 2 days (with breaks) in a car before the tournament.  Thus, we are left with flying as the only viable option.</p>
<p>A round trip flight to Vancouver from Winnipeg costs approximately  $550 - $750, depending on a number of different factors.  Using a low ballpark figure of $600 and a team size of 14 (our current roster, excluding our teammates from Regina and Ottawa), our estimated costs to get the team to Nationals and back are $8,400.  Adding in a buffer for Indiegogo fees, costs associated with printing and shipping perks and unforeseen complications, we arrived at our funding goal of $12,600.</p>
<p>We have a number of awesome perks for you in exchange for your support!</p>
<p><b>Undying Gratitude</b></p>
<p>No matter how much you pledge, we will love you forever and show that love in a consensual, platonic and probably social media-centered way.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary We are a community-based competitive Quidditch team in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  As the first team in the province, we are dedicated to improving our skills while bringing the game of Quidditch to a wider audience throughout Manitoba and the prairies. As a community-based team, we do not have the support of a university to help fund our team so we are asking for your help!
This campaign is to raise money to subsidize our travel expenses to get to the Quidditch Canada National Championships in Vancouver, BC.  After placing 2nd in the Western Regional Championships, we are excited to bring our little team from the heart of the nation out to Nationals to show all the big players how we kick butt, Manitoba-style!
Quidditch is a trans-positive, inclusive sport and we pride ourselves on maintaining that inclusive spirit in everything we do both at home and abroad.  As part of our goal of inclusivity, we want to mitigate the affect that travel costs can have on anyone's ability to participate in our sport.  Anything you can spare to help us reach our goal will only help to grow and foster this spirit and this sport in Canada, and especially in Manitoba.   What We Need & What You Get As you may or may not know, Canada is really big,* and Winnipeg is literally in the middle making travelling exceptionally expensive for us, no matter where we go.  In considering our options for how to get to Nationals, we looked at driving, but a 24 hour road trip each way is not feasible for any of our players due to work, school and other commitments.  It would also significantly impact our competitiveness to spend 2 days (with breaks) in a car before the tournament.  Thus, we are left with flying as the only viable option.
A round trip flight to Vancouver from Winnipeg costs approximately  $550 - $750, depending on a number of different factors.  Using a low ballpark figure of $600 and a team size of 14 (our current roster, excluding our teammates from Regina and Ottawa), our estimated costs to get the team to Nationals and back are $8,400.  Adding in a buffer for Indiegogo fees, costs associated with printing and shipping perks and unforeseen complications, we arrived at our funding goal of $12,600.
We have a number of awesome perks for you in exchange for your support!
Undying Gratitude
No matter how much you pledge, we will love you forever and show that love in a consensual, platonic and probably social media-centered way.
STICKERS!!!
Our amazing team designers (who are also responsible for our amazing jerseys) designed a beautiful team crest for us:


For just $5 you can get your very own copy of this crest ON A STICKER!!!
Our designers also put together a gorgeous set of 4 stickers for each of the positions on a Quidditch team - Beater, Chaser, Keeper & Seeker.  You're going to want them.  You can get any single one of these, of your choice, for only $5! And, if that wasn't good enough already, you can get ALL 4 PLUS our beautiful crest for only $15!!! That's $10 in savings!


PROFESSIONAL PHOTOS
If you pledge over $10, you will get access to an online gallery of full size (up to 16.2MP, depending on cropping, etc) watermark free copies of every picture our Fearless Leader (Quidditch Canada Staff Photographer Jason ""jalestro"" Rosenberg) takes at Nationals.  These pictures will be fully edited, retouched and awesome.
On top of that, we'll send you a 4""x6"" print of your favourite picture from the set ABSOLUTELY FREE!!!
Want more photo-licious goodness? Pledge over $20 and you get 5 PRINTS OF YOUR CHOICE!!!
(For prints bigger than 4""x6"" message us and we will work something out).
QUIDDITCH CANADA T-SHIRTS!
We still have some Quidditch Canada T-shirts left over from a previous local fundraising campaign.  For only $30 you can get one of these beautiful white Gildan tees with the Quidditch Canada logo centred on the front along with all 5 stickers and prints from above!


These shirts are EXTREMELY LIMITED in quantity, and we won't be printing anymore so MAKE SURE TO PICK THE RIGHT SIZE AND CUT when choosing your perk for these shirts.
EXCLUSIVE WINNIPEG WHOMPING WILLOWS CREST T-SHIRTS
Did you see that beautiful crest up above? Do you want it on a t-shirt to go with your awesome sticker? At the $40 tier, you can get just that! These shirts will be printed on high-quality American Apparel or Gildan tees in ROYAL BLUE (we are looking into pricing and colours on different brands of shirt). And, you also get all 5 stickers and prints to boot!


Bloody hell, that's a tight jersey, ain't it?
Ok, so I've been watching too much Orphan Black, but the point still stands.  Our jerseys are delightful, and now you can get one of your very own!

<p>Hello, I'm Phil Ruggiero and have Type 2 Diabetes.  I started a blog, solutionsfort2diabetes.com, to provide information and encouragement to those with Type 2 Diabetes.  But, the more I found out, the angrier I became because Diabetes is taking a terrible toll on the country and the world.  Forget the money lost; it's the lost lives and lost time with loved ones that did not have to happen.  I got angry because the research has shown since 2007 that Diabetes kills over 230,000 people every year and it's growing!  And yet it's buried on a fact sheet.</p>
<p>Diabetes is a public menace and must be beat.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h1>Hello everyone, Deuce Pesic here…</h1>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thank you for viewing our video.<span style="""">  </span>For those that are unaware, I began creating my designs when I fell in love with the Farnsworth House.<span style="""">  </span>A mid-century modern home built by architect Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe in 1951.<span style="""">  </span>A minimalist steel and glass structure that is simple yet elegant.<span style="""">  </span>I was<span style="""">  </span>overwhelmed by the cost of the higher end design styles that I learned to work with concrete and polymer resins to create my own backsplashes, countertops and vessel sinks in order to keep the costs down.<span style="""">  </span>I anticipated retail sales of my design styles as each piece is handmade to match the exact desired colors through inlaying virtually anything, i.e. sands, stones, pebbles, silk flowers, metals even pictures.<span style="""">  </span>When the housing market crashed, I continued to work with the materials but I scaled down to gift ideas and home accessories.<span style="""">  </span>Feel free to view previous works at <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ndpesicgroup"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/ndpesicgroup</a>.<span style="""">  </span>Someone mentioned how cool it would be if the dimensions were smaller and if it folded within itself, they could be sold to high end beach resorts around the globe as an oasis between the beach and resort itself, each tailored to perform its own function, a cocktail lounge, shower areas and cabanas.<span style="""">  </span>As I was drawing the preliminary sketches, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.<span style="""">  </span>This is when I realized that F.R.E.N.D.S. will initially be rolled out as a humanitarian product.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">F.R.E.N.D.S. provide assistance in locations in 2 major ways.<span style="""">  </span>Not only do they deliver aid to people in areas where aid is unavailable, but by providing the necessary environment for volunteers to do their jobs effectively, we hope it will bring more volunteers out.<span style="""">  </span>These people who are willing to leave their families behind, to go to unknown areas and to help people they do not know, now have a facility to do their jobs and also have a temporary shelter as well.<span style="""">  </span>We all have had a time in our lives where our friends helped us through our most difficult times.<span style="""">  </span>I know…it has happened to me as well.<span style="""">  </span>I have stated many times that I have the greatest friends in the world.<span style="""">  </span>Always looking out to assure all is well and that our needs are met.<span style="""">  </span>It was a coincidence, yet very fitting, that the acronym developed as it did.</p>
<h1>What we need and what you get</h1>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">$1.75 MM will get us quite a bit.<span style="""">  </span>To elaborate from the video, we are planning to build 2 prototypes.<span style="""">  </span>We are building both the 50’ unit as well as the 25’ F.R.E.N.D.S.<span style="""">  </span>in order to show the stacking capabilities.<span style="""">  </span>The solar package I stated in the video is for the 50’ structure alone so we will need an additional 16 solar panels and 4 batteries for the smaller units.<span style="""">  </span>The 2 prototypes will cost approximately $400,000 to build.<span style="""">  </span>The aluminum skeleton for the 50’ unit alone is $100,000 including labor (less tax).<span style="""">  </span>So when we factor in the 2 units, then the facility being the highest expense as stated above, it’s a reasonable amount considering we also have electric and water, engineering fees, attorneys, accountant and operating costs such as travel, communications and payroll. A Public Relations firm would be needed to deliver the project to prospected buyers such as The Red Cross, FEMA, Homeland Security and our own U.S. Military.<span style="""">  </span>The uses are vast and versatile. So the amount we request is pretty accurate.<span style="""">  </span>Being that this amount is so close with not too much room for error, we hope we inspire enough people globally so as to receive more than the requested amount.<span style="""">  </span>But it gets better…</p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">I would feel uncomfortable being a repeat campaigner on indiegogo.<span style="""">  </span>I feel other projects do need to set themselves up in stages to get the funding they need.<span style="""">  </span>Because I am attempting to appear here only this time, we want to make you a promise….I pledge….that if we receive $5 MM in donations, we will utilize 20% of that amount (after fees) to fund our other project called “The Lint Project” !!<span style="""">  </span>The Lint Project is an idea I have to acquire dryer lint in mass quantities, deliver to a central textile facility where it will be sanitized and manufactured into a renewable material.<span style="""">  </span>It will be used to produce clothing to help clothe the homeless and those who lost everything in natural disasters.<span style="""">  </span>The 20% will allow us to hire grant writers and maybe a lobbyist that will help us get government subsidies to perform a test state.<span style="""">  </span>This test state would have our own bins in front of contracted grocery store chains to acquire the lint from homeowners, (we all have a lint bag next to our driers).<span style="""">  </span>Drivers would pick up the bags of lint and transport them to a textile facility to manufacture the renewable material.<span style="""">  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">It is very evident that your contributions would not only aid people in your own communities but on a global scale as well.<span style="""">  </span>This is why our perks to you are unique.<span style="""">  </span>For the majority of funding of $125 and under, a<span style="""">  </span>t-shirt that will be designed by me, then we will make my polymer resin<span style="""">  </span>creations…a large coaster (5 ½ inch bread plate size) and a plaque, puzzle piece design, <span style=""""> </span>with a “Proud Supporter of F.R.E.N.D.S.” inlay that will be signed and numbered.<span style="""">  </span>The plaque symbolizes a connection to the donor before you and after you, that you were a part of a larger picture…that without your piece, it would be incomplete.<span style="""">   </span>I am also extending the $125 perk to every 250<sup>th</sup> consecutive donor of $20 and under (one per household) because their work and dedication on helping to spread the word is equally important as the ones donating higher amounts.</p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">We will pay for domestic and international shipping on all perks.</p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText""><strong style="""">Remember….</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">We hope to reach many people.<span style="""">  </span>The only way to do it, is by spreading the word and encourage your recipients to do the same.<span style="""">  </span>We would love to watch the project travel around the globe a few times. Because times are tight and we are doing the Public Relations ourselves, I have set the date to 55 days.<span style="""">  </span>This way if bills are already paid this month, you can budget what you can for F.R.E.N.D.S. next month.</p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">Spreading the word alone is just as important as the funds we are raising.<span style="""">  </span>Getting the link passed around and in front of as many people as possible, can result in it, getting in front of the right individuals or organizations that can make a huge impact to this project.<span style="""">  </span>So even if you cannot do it financially, do it socially.<span style="""">  </span>You should feel proud that you contributed in saving many, many lives.</p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">I want to thank you all in taking the time to view and read up on F.R.E.N.D.S.<span style="""">  </span>We are One People, One Earth.<span style="""">  </span>If we do not look out for each other, who will??</p>

Thank you for viewing our video.  For those that are unaware, I began creating my designs when I fell in love with the Farnsworth House.  A mid-century modern home built by architect Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe in 1951.  A minimalist steel and glass structure that is simple yet elegant.  I was  overwhelmed by the cost of the higher end design styles that I learned to work with concrete and polymer resins to create my own backsplashes, countertops and vessel sinks in order to keep the costs down.  I anticipated retail sales of my design styles as each piece is handmade to match the exact desired colors through inlaying virtually anything, i.e. sands, stones, pebbles, silk flowers, metals even pictures.  When the housing market crashed, I continued to work with the materials but I scaled down to gift ideas and home accessories.  Feel free to view previous works at http://www.myspace.com/ndpesicgroup.  Someone mentioned how cool it would be if the dimensions were smaller and if it folded within itself, they could be sold to high end beach resorts around the globe as an oasis between the beach and resort itself, each tailored to perform its own function, a cocktail lounge, shower areas and cabanas.  As I was drawing the preliminary sketches, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.  This is when I realized that F.R.E.N.D.S. will initially be rolled out as a humanitarian product.
F.R.E.N.D.S. provide assistance in locations in 2 major ways.  Not only do they deliver aid to people in areas where aid is unavailable, but by providing the necessary environment for volunteers to do their jobs effectively, we hope it will bring more volunteers out.  These people who are willing to leave their families behind, to go to unknown areas and to help people they do not know, now have a facility to do their jobs and also have a temporary shelter as well.  We all have had a time in our lives where our friends helped us through our most difficult times.  I know…it has happened to me as well.  I have stated many times that I have the greatest friends in the world.  Always looking out to assure all is well and that our needs are met.  It was a coincidence, yet very fitting, that the acronym developed as it did.
What we need and what you get
$1.75 MM will get us quite a bit.  To elaborate from the video, we are planning to build 2 prototypes.  We are building both the 50’ unit as well as the 25’ F.R.E.N.D.S.  in order to show the stacking capabilities.  The solar package I stated in the video is for the 50’ structure alone so we will need an additional 16 solar panels and 4 batteries for the smaller units.  The 2 prototypes will cost approximately $400,000 to build.  The aluminum skeleton for the 50’ unit alone is $100,000 including labor (less tax).  So when we factor in the 2 units, then the facility being the highest expense as stated above, it’s a reasonable amount considering we also have electric and water, engineering fees, attorneys, accountant and operating costs such as travel, communications and payroll. A Public Relations firm would be needed to deliver the project to prospected buyers such as The Red Cross, FEMA, Homeland Security and our own U.S. Military.  The uses are vast and versatile. So the amount we request is pretty accurate.  Being that this amount is so close with not too much room for error, we hope we inspire enough people globally so as to receive more than the requested amount.  But it gets better…
I would feel uncomfortable being a repeat campaigner on indiegogo.  I feel other projects do need to set themselves up in stages to get the funding they need.  Because I am attempting to appear here only this time, we want to make you a promise….I pledge….that if we receive $5 MM in donations, we will utilize 20% of that amount (after fees) to fund our other project called “The Lint Project” !!  The Lint Project is an idea I have to acquire dryer lint in mass quantities, deliver to a central textile facility where it will be sanitized and manufactured into a renewable material.  It will be used to produce clothing to help clothe the homeless and those who lost everything in natural disasters.  The 20% will allow us to hire grant writers and maybe a lobbyist that will help us get government subsidies to perform a test state.  This test state would have our own bins in front of contracted grocery store chains to acquire the lint from homeowners, (we all have a lint bag next to our driers).  Drivers would pick up the bags of lint and transport them to a textile facility to manufacture the renewable material.  
It is very evident that your contributions would not only aid people in your own communities but on a global scale as well.  This is why our perks to you are unique.  For the majority of funding of $125 and under, a  t-shirt that will be designed by me, then we will make my polymer resin  creations…a large coaster (5 ½ inch bread plate size) and a plaque, puzzle piece design,  with a “Proud Supporter of F.R.E.N.D.S.” inlay that will be signed and numbered.  The plaque symbolizes a connection to the donor before you and after you, that you were a part of a larger picture…that without your piece, it would be incomplete.   I am also extending the $125 perk to every 250th consecutive donor of $20 and under (one per household) because their work and dedication on helping to spread the word is equally important as the ones donating higher amounts.
We will pay for domestic and international shipping on all perks.
Remember….
We hope to reach many people.  The only way to do it, is by spreading the word and encourage your recipients to do the same.  We would love to watch the project travel around the globe a few times. Because times are tight and we are doing the Public Relations ourselves, I have set the date to 55 days.  This way if bills are already paid this month, you can budget what you can for F.R.E.N.D.S. next month.
Spreading the word alone is just as important as the funds we are raising.  Getting the link passed around and in front of as many people as possible, can result in it, getting in front of the right individuals or organizations that can make a huge impact to this project.  So even if you cannot do it financially, do it socially.  You should feel proud that you contributed in saving many, many lives.
I want to thank you all in taking the time to view and read up on F.R.E.N.D.S.  We are One People, One Earth.  If we do not look out for each other, who will??

<p class=""MsoNormal"">My name is Benita Elias, and about ten years ago my mother was diagnosed with cancer. She never liked to talk about it because she didn’t want my brother or I to worry about her, nevertheless we did everything we could to help. After a lot of work, and all this time later, her cancer is in complete remission! If she hadn’t done anything about it, the doctors said she would only have had ten years left.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This really puts into perspective how long we have on this earth. My mom and I always talk about the things we would like to do together, but the conversation usually ends with us saying “well, someday…”.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My mother has always wanted to travel, but she had us fairly young and dedicated all her time and energy to raising us by herself. Now that we are grown, she is sort of starting over and trying to figure out what she wants to do. I am a full time student with a two year old son, so between the two of us, we really don’t have the funds for vacations!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The one place she has always wanted to see here in the US is New York City. Instead of putting off a mother-daughter trip any longer, I would love to surprise her by taking her this year! This is where I need your help.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I have researched making this trip for months before I decided to go for it here. I have worked hard to find the best deals and be as frugal as possible. So, I am trying to raise $2800.00, which breaks down like this (I have rounded up to the nearest ten to account for taxes):</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Round trip plane tickets for the both of us: $1,200</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Hotel room for four nights: $850</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Travel: Metro cards for the subway, $60 for two of us to have unlimited rides for the duration of the trip, plus $40 for a cab ride once we land to the hotel, totaling $100 for travel.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Food and contingencies: $500, this equals out to about $50 per person for food per day, and includes if we have any minor unexpected expenses</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Platform fees: The additionall $150 accounts for the funding fees</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If I do not make the goal at all, I will donate the entirety of the money to the clinic that helped my mom overcome cancer. We didn’t have health insurance and it is because of small clinics like this that helped save my mom.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The same goes for if this raises more than my goal, any additional money will be donated to the clinic.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I understand that there are so many worthwhile causes out there to donate to, through this project you can make at least one person’s dream a reality! This is valuable to me because I have always wanted to do something like this for my mom but have never been able to afford it. It is a possibility that I might never have been able to take her on a trip and it would have just been a dream. I can just imagine how happy this would make her, and how wonderful it would be to know that there are people out there generous enough to make this happen.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you are not able to make a monetary contribution, just spreading the word helps greatly and it is much appreciated!!!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!</p>

I set the goal low because I figure everyone is hurting for money right now. To cover my bills itll cost around $1200.00.  Kaiser Gold Plan for Individuals, age 32. My MRI's and other large tests have a $250 dollar copay, my GP has a $30 dollar copay, my specialists have a $50 dollar copay, my labs have a $30 dollar copay, my medication varies, Pain management classes are $30 dollars a class with a doctor to help me deal with the horrific pain without having to take narcotic medications. All of these things, plus my other living expenses have run me dry.  I don't like asking for help at all. Its just not me.

based interventions in the area since 2003 with the mission of decreasing
malnutrition in the region through sustainable use of local resources and
knowledge coupled with food preservation techniques used for decades here in
the United States. Our task is to conduct health screenings, assist local
medical personnel, share knowledge and education about health, and collect
statistical data to help conduct a longitudinal study on the effects of
increased nutrition on the local population. We will also educate locals on

</p><p><b>Hello my name is Ron Triebels</b></p>
<p>Having personal experience with relatives that
are diabetics, I know the importance of proper foot care. Having diabetes puts
you at a significant risk of developing major foot problems from Peripheral
Neuropathy to Ulcerations. When untreated, these problems can result in serious
infections or even loss of limbs. </p>
<p>I
was very excited when the opportunity presented itself to create a Diabetic
Sock using Zinc ions spun into the yarn that would actually fight bacteria.
More importantly the difference this diabetic sock could make for people with
diabetes. To get started, we desperately need your support to help us fund this
program. This money will go to creating the Antimicrobial Yarn (Z-Guard),
Create Socks for Men, Woman and children that have a Designer look to them.</p>
<span></span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/292946/files/20140105180057-Foot_Slide.jpg?1388973657"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>FACT</b>: Per the American Diabetes Association, there
are over 80,000 amputations performed in<span> the USA per year. Most of these
amputations are Diabetes related.</span>
</p><p><b>FACT:<span>  </span></b>According to the ADA comprehensive
foot care can reduce amputations by 45% - 80%. <b><span><span></span></span></b>Wearing Diabetic Zinc
Socks featuring Z-Guard Zinc ion yarn could make a big Difference for people with diabetes.<br/></p>
<p><b>HERE’S HOW THE
SOCK WORKS: </b>The
part of the foot that sweats the most is the Toe, Sole and Heel. That’s because
that’s the part of the foot that sits in the shoe. When bacteria comes in contact with the bottom of the Diabetic Zinc Socks, the Zinc
ions in the yarn instantly prevent the growth of the bacteria’s buy cutting off
its oxygen supply, thus preventing it from colonizing (growing ) in the sock.</p>
<p>Shown below, The Toe, Sole
and Heel of the Diabetic Zinc Socks is made from 100% Natural Cotton, Bamboo
and Zinc Ions ( Z-Guard Yarn) all Spun together and are biologically active
which damage key enzyme systems in the cell membranes of bacteria. This gives the fibers the ability to wipe out
virtually all Superbug Bacteria with protection that's built in. Does not rub off</p>

<p><b>LABORATORY TESTED vs SUPERBUG MRSA
BACTERIA with PROVEN RESULTS:</b></p>
<p>Shown below<b>, </b>is a test done by the NAMSA Test Facility of the Z-Guard Antimicrobial fabric for one of the most difficult of
the current crop of ""Superbug Bacteria"" namely MRSA (Staph)<b>. The
results were outstanding. 500,000 MRSA Microbes were wiped out on CONTACT!</b></p>

<p><b>OUR GOAL:</b></p>
<p><b>The goal is to raise over $40,000.00.
This will give us the ability to purchase the raw materials to spin the Z Guard
yarn, custom dye the yarn and have enough starting inventory to create (20)
sock designs. We would like to offer Diabetic Zinc Socks for Men, Women and
Children Socks. If we do not reach our
entire goal we will use the contributions we do receive to further our process.

<p><b>HOW CAN YOU HELP</b></p>
<p><b>Your donation is most important
as it will go to helping people with Diabetes. People with diabetes around the
world will be able to purchase our Diabetic Zinc Socks on line and know that
they are getting a sock that can give them protection against bacteria. The
Diabetic Zinc Sock can be a real game changer for diabetics. If you are unable
to contribute financially please share this information and our campaign to
anyone you can. We appreciate any help and support you are able to give us and
diabetic people around the world.</b></p><p><b>REWARDS:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/294531/files/20140106151141-all_Rewards.jpg?1389049901"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p>

are diabetics, I know the importance of proper foot care. Having diabetes puts
you at a significant risk of developing major foot problems from Peripheral
Neuropathy to Ulcerations. When untreated, these problems can result in serious
infections or even loss of limbs. 
I
was very excited when the opportunity presented itself to create a Diabetic
Sock using Zinc ions spun into the yarn that would actually fight bacteria.
More importantly the difference this diabetic sock could make for people with
diabetes. To get started, we desperately need your support to help us fund this
program. This money will go to creating the Antimicrobial Yarn (Z-Guard),
Create Socks for Men, Woman and children that have a Designer look to them.

FACT: Per the American Diabetes Association, there
are over 80,000 amputations performed in the USA per year. Most of these
amputations are Diabetes related.
FACT:  According to the ADA comprehensive
foot care can reduce amputations by 45% - 80%. Wearing Diabetic Zinc
Socks featuring Z-Guard Zinc ion yarn could make a big Difference for people with diabetes.
HERE’S HOW THE
SOCK WORKS: The
part of the foot that sweats the most is the Toe, Sole and Heel. That’s because
that’s the part of the foot that sits in the shoe. When bacteria comes in contact with the bottom of the Diabetic Zinc Socks, the Zinc
ions in the yarn instantly prevent the growth of the bacteria’s buy cutting off
its oxygen supply, thus preventing it from colonizing (growing ) in the sock.
Shown below, The Toe, Sole
and Heel of the Diabetic Zinc Socks is made from 100% Natural Cotton, Bamboo
and Zinc Ions ( Z-Guard Yarn) all Spun together and are biologically active
which damage key enzyme systems in the cell membranes of bacteria. This gives the fibers the ability to wipe out
virtually all Superbug Bacteria with protection that's built in. Does not rub off

LABORATORY TESTED vs SUPERBUG MRSA
BACTERIA with PROVEN RESULTS:
Shown below, is a test done by the NAMSA Test Facility of the Z-Guard Antimicrobial fabric for one of the most difficult of
the current crop of ""Superbug Bacteria"" namely MRSA (Staph). The
results were outstanding. 500,000 MRSA Microbes were wiped out on CONTACT!

DIABETIC SOCK COMPARISON: 

OUR GOAL:
The goal is to raise over $40,000.00.
This will give us the ability to purchase the raw materials to spin the Z Guard
yarn, custom dye the yarn and have enough starting inventory to create (20)
sock designs. We would like to offer Diabetic Zinc Socks for Men, Women and
Children Socks. If we do not reach our
entire goal we will use the contributions we do receive to further our process.

HOW CAN YOU HELP
Your donation is most important
as it will go to helping people with Diabetes. People with diabetes around the
world will be able to purchase our Diabetic Zinc Socks on line and know that
they are getting a sock that can give them protection against bacteria. The
Diabetic Zinc Sock can be a real game changer for diabetics. If you are unable
to contribute financially please share this information and our campaign to
anyone you can. We appreciate any help and support you are able to give us and
diabetic people around the world.REWARDS:",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

It's the thing all the sleep health advocates have been waiting for.
It tracks your sleep phases.
It's contactless and comfortable. Sleep Phaser sits on your bedside table. No wires. No hardware in your bed.
The sensor is passive. No high-energy radio! Monitoring works via passive infrared detection. The main deflector dish stays offline.
It's a beautiful reading smartlight.
We have no desire for investors to tell us what we should do or how the thing should look. Instead, we believe that with your support, we can deliver Sleep Phaser to you in the fastest and most transparent way.What you'll find below

Timeline
Perks!
The tech behind Sleep PhaserWe have teamed up with Happy Electronics, a manufacturing company from the Czech Republic, with whom we already successfully produce other hardware such as Mindroid Glasses and Sleep Masks.At the heart of Sleep Phaser is a passive infrared sensor that senses how your body heat changes. We have developed a set of algorithms which enable us to translate the minute heat changes into knowledge about your sleep phases. In an ideal setting, Sleep Phaser can also detect your breathing rate (see details below).  Sleep Phaser uses an USB connector for the power supply.  In the box, you will get a USB charger. Unfortunately we had to drop smartphone charging feature since there was too much powerline interference that was scrambling the activity monitoring. Sleep Phaser connects to Sleep as Android (full license included with Sleep Phaser) to use its extensive arsenal of features: 
Smart alarm that wakes you up at the perfect moment
Long-term sleep analysis with statistics
Cloud app for backup and desktop access to your data
Google Fit & Samsung Health integration
Automatization via Tasker and IFTTT
Dedicated support
 NOTE: You need an Android phone to monitor sleep with Sleep Phaser.Only the plastic chassis of the Sleep Phaser is manufactured in China, internal electronics are added in the heart of Europe - Czech Republic.Circuit boards for Sleep Phaser are printed in the Czech Republic  All the components are soldered onto the circuit boards in the Czech Republic as well  Finally, every Sleep Phaser is completed by hand in the factory shop of Happy Electronics, in Prague, Czech Republic  Why Sleep Phaser?Compared to other standalone sleep tracking solutions, Sleep Phaser is:

How it's used?In the evening, you go to bed to digest a few pages of the book you've been reading lately.At this point, you can either turn on the light directly by a hardware button to get a (hardware-dimmable) white light - or put your phone into a charger to ​start up paused sleep tracking automatically.When you go to sleep, just turn off the Phaser by the hardware button and sleep tracking will un-pause. In the morning, you'll get woken up in the light sleep phase by a sunrise effect (a light slowly brightening up from 0 (at red colour) to 100% brightness (at orange-white-ish colour).We've also received some requests to change the hue/brightness at will, so we'll release a separate light control app for the Sleep Phaser in case you just want to control the light but not do sleep tracking. Breath rate detectionThe passive infrared sensor in Sleep Phaser is so sensitive it can measure breathing.

As Seen On:










It's All About How You Feel

The WellBe bracelet monitors your heart rate and uses a patent pending algorithm to determine your stress and calmness levels based on time, location and people you meet throughout your day. Crafted from cork, the WellBe bracelet is lightweight, durable, and soft against your skin. 




Convert Stress into Calmness 

The WellBe app allows you to get an overview of your stress triggers, and offers personalized stress reducing programs to help you retain a calm state of being. Our app offers a variety of mindfulness exercises such as:

Meditations
Focused Breathing 
Guided Imagination
Personalized programs and playlists

Our app also offers programs for 7, 14 and 21 days from renowned mentors through the Mentors Channel, all designed to encourage you to adopt well-being as a habit.






Less Stress - Better Health - Slower AgingStress has been scientifically proven to have negative impact on human life, generating negative health implications such as headaches, fatigue, sleeping disorders, digestive problems, high blood pressure, heart diseases, aging and obesity. The longer the stress lasts, the worse it is for both your mind and body and the more difficult it is to recover. Mindfulness and meditation have been proven as highly effective ways to release stress and have many positive effects on sleep, productivity as well as lasting good feeling. A recent study from Harvard University suggests that meditation is influencing the grey matter in the brain and thus allowing better aging of the brain and the body.





Seeing is Believing 


The WellBe measures the changes in your stress/calmness levels while practicing the different stress release exercises, allowing you to see the 'before and after' effect of each program you practice. 


Personalized Playlist of Well-Being Exercises



Based on the analysis of your stress/calmness levels before and after the meditations you practice the WellBe app offers you a personalized playlist of programs and meditations that are likely to have the most positive effect on you. 



Relaxation is Good - WellBe Makes it a Habit
The WellBe app also offers many programs geared towards helping you remain calm regardless of circumstances. These programs include 7, 14, and 21 days plans coming from renowned mentors through our partnership with Mentors Channel and they are all designed to deal with all those stressful aspects of life which are keeping us away from our natural calm state of being.
These plans will remind you to meditate every day and will slowly but surely bring you back to the quiet space that always exist within you and for you. Practice makes perfect and the WellBe was designed as a tool that would make it easy for you to retain calmness as an ongoing state of being.  
 

The Perfect Time to Take a 5-Minute Break


The
WellBe app is receiving your stress/calmness information from the WellBe
bracelet on an hourly basis. You can set the app to send you an alert when your
stress level exceeds a certain level and this alert will also include an
effective exercise or meditation that would allow you to reduce stress and
restore your calmness immediately.

<h3>My Goal</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Andrea Olson. I am 25, married and an Environmental Chemist working for the government in Indiana. Last May, my mom, who lives in Texas and who is ONLY 46, was diagnosed with Stage 3 colorectal cancer. Her story is below but basically for almost 10 months she has been through chemo, radiation, and different surgeries resulting from the tumor in her colon. Throughout this struggling time, she was newly spoused but her husband hasn't had the opportunity to be by her side due to a deployment to Afghanistan. He left for training before her tumor removal surgery and was deployed last August and won't return until this coming August. Throughout these months, she has been on an emotional roller coaster thinking her cancer was gone but then was recently told in February that her cancer had metastasized into her liver and lung and she was now upgraded to Stage 4. The doctor has given her 6-8 months to live without treatment. She is researching several clinics who could really help her but most are not covered by her insurance since she is finding alternative ways for treatment other than chemo.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/697261/pictures/full/20130309050924-537925_4346117779605_1103937515_n.jpg?1362834569"" src="""" style=""width: 290px; height: 244px;""/></p>
<p>With this month being National Colorectal Cancer Awareness month, I want to spread awareness and help raise money for my mom's treatment costs. I believe with more treatment she could beat the statistics and live for much longer than two years because of her age and good health. My goal is to run every mile at the Mini Marathon in Indianapolis and ask for donors to support me by donating any amount for how many miles they think I can run. I have never ran the Mini or 13.1 miles at that but will be training my butt off for the next two months and will wear a shirt supporting my mom everytime I run the trails/streets in my town. Any donations up until the Mini are acceptable and greatly appreciated also!</p>
<p>My mom's treatment could cost her anywhere from  $400-$1,000/day and ANY amount of money is greatly appreciated. I set my goal to $5,000 in order to expect small and dream big. I would love to pay for all of her treatment but my husband and I work for the public and it doesn't pay as much as you would think.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/696355/primary_pictures/original/20130309055314-IMG_1430.JPG?1362837193"" src="""" style=""width: 230px; height: 244px;""/></p>
<h3>What We Need From You...</h3>
<p>We need anything that you are willing to give:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monetary donations (100% of all proceeds go to Mom's treatment!)</li>
<li>Spreading the word to all your friends or family members on Facebook or simply giving them this link so they can read about this extremely noble cause</li>
<li>Your thoughts and prayers</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I'm Doing for the Cause</h3>
<ul>
<li>I will be training for 2 months, prepping for the Mini in Indianapolis.  Anybody can donate any amount of money per mile that I run without stopping.</li>
<li>I will also be spreading the word and going from place to place telling my mom's story to build support for her.</li>
<li>T-shirts have been designed by us to wear while training around the town of Plainfield to share the awareness.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/704226/pictures/full/20130313174112-Shirts_for_mom.png?1363221679"" src="""" style=""width: 393px; height: 229px;""/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are many reasons your monetary donation is important:</p>
<ul>
<li>My mom is waiting to start treatment until money is available</li>
<li>Payment is due per procedure so raising all the money I can is Vital</li>
<li>There is no telling how long it will be for us to start treatment without donations</li>
</ul>

<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2040"">First of all I want to say Thank you God for giving me breath and the strength to be able to endure today and have the strength to write this story..</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2042"">I am a 46 year old female a newly spouse of Michael Player, who is currently deployed to Afghanistan with the Military.</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2043"">I am a mother of five beautiful children and one Awesome grandson who is 11 years old.</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2025"">On May 2, 2012 a trio to the Emergency Room, started a different pathway to a life that I have always taken for granted, a life that I thought I would  grow old and gray, sitting on the front porch in a rocking chair with my Husband looking around at the kids and grandkids and talking about the memories we have shared over the years that we have been together.</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2026"">On May 2, 2012 that vision was quickly changed. My husband, at the time was currently deployed to Germany for a month long mission. I found myself alone at home feeling very nauseated and having severe abdominal cramps. I thought laying down for a while might subside the symptoms, but after a few hours the symptoms was getting worse and I started to feel faint. Since being all alone, I started getting really scared and called the ambulance before I blacked out. By the time I reached the hospital, my symptoms were even worse. I couldnt imagine what was going on with me. Being there by myself and going through all these symptoms, I just wanted to be near my husband and kids.</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_1670"">The Dr after a few hours was able to subside my symptoms and I started feeling better. The Dr came in with the results of the testing that was ran and stated it just looked like a severe case of constipation, and I thought all of that pain just because I had to use the bathroom?</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_1667"">The the Dr said when they did a scan they had found some darken areas that he was concerned about and ordered a colonoscopy, to make sure nothing else going on..So the trip to the ER landed me a overnight stay in the hospital..</div>
<div>The next day the procedure was performed..As I awoke from it, I looked over and there set my Dr right next to me holding my hand and then I looked into his face and out came the life changing words, the most devastating news that at that point changed the pathway to my life</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2027"">forever. He said I am sorry to tell you this, but you have stage 3 Colorectal Cancer. The tumor was so big he couldnt even do the Colonscopy it was blocking the entrance of my colon.At that point, I thought, I am just not fully awake from the Anesthesia and it was just a bad nightmare, So I shook my head and asked the Dr what he said again, and he then repeated the diagnosis. A rush of every emotion imaginable filled my body and I thought No this cant be, I am to young, I have five kids and a grandson that desperately need me, a newly husband I was planning on spending the rest of my life with and at that moment, that vision of sitting on the front porch old and gray in the rocking chairs with my husband was shattered. I yelled No as the tears was streaming down my face, this cant be happening to me. At that moment I looked around and realized I was by myself and all I wanted was to see my husband, my kids and my family and have them near.</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2039"">A week went by doing all of the neccesary preparation for the surgery for the tumor removal and the 5 lymph nodes that were affected.</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2028"">Then the big day came May 7th 2012 for the surgery. Surgery was very lengthy, much longer then anticipated.The tumor was removed along with the effected lymph nodes. That next week was grueling going through recovery..But Michael was finally do home in a week so it really helped getting through it. I had a month to spend with him before he was taken back up for deployment but this time to Afghanistan and it was going to be for over a year.The Dr stated I needed to do Chemo and Radiation therapy as a preventive measure and that would be starting around the time he was to leave. So for the next month I tried to enjoy as much time with him and my family while recovering from surgery. The month flew by very quickly and before you knew it the time had come for him to leave and the treatments to start which was all on the same day.The next 2.5 months was very rough. My body did not handle both treatments at the same time very well to the point I had to quit therapy for two weeks to let my body recover..The treatments ended in August. I was told I was cancer free..At that point I had totally started changing my diet, doing alot of research on healing my body and making it healthy again by taking natural supplements, juicing eating lots of fruits and vegetables etc. I was finally starting to feel human again after several months.But I was starting to have difficulting eating anything heavy like meat, pasta and breads and digesting it so my diet was starting to basically get down to where I can only eat salads..</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2038"">A few months went by and still having eating problems. And another scan was scheduled to check on the remission of the cancer which was done in end of November.. I felt positive and thought everything was going to come back ok, but everything came to a big surpirise when the  Dr came in and said that the cancer had Metastize and now moved into my liver and lungs with the cancer now being upgraded to stage 4  cancer.</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2029"">I finally seen a Gastro Dr for my eating problems and he said basically everything according to the xrays was a mess up in there. So The first of three Colonoscopy has been scheduled to go in and dilate my colon opening so I can pass my food since the opening was a size of a pin hole originally. The Dr had stated that even though he was able to temporary help me, looks like a another surgery was going to be needed to repair the damage from the previous one.And at this point Another Colon surgery is scheduled in a few weeks.</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2030"">In the mean time I had decided to try and get hooked up with another Oncologists for the metastizing of the cancer and since the previous scan at the time was a few months old another one was ordered which was just done in February of 2013 with the shocking results of the cancer has gotten alittle worse with the masses alittle larger in the spotted previous areas. The Dr at that time gave me 6-8 months without treatment to 2 years with treatment. Once again, my body felt a rush of different emotions, and the tears once again came a pouring down. And  all visions of my future felt like a door that just slammed shut.. I felt sick and I cried, God why? Why me? Why is this happening? The Dr stated that since I have been having so much issues with my digestion and have lost so much weight that I needed to get my colon fixed first before my body can deal with any type of treatments..So any type of treatments are now postponed until I have surgery and recover for a while after that for healing..Its like a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. I need to get fixed to eat and need to start treatments to fix the cancer..</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2037"">In the mean time I have now been doing alot more reading and researching on different alternatives to try and keep everything at bay.

Unfortunately insurance doesnt cover these treatments since alot of them are still in the trial stages..I did visit the clinic about a week or so go. It was a very good and positive visit with good things said on helping me get my health and immune system back in the right direction ..</div>
<div id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1362830494881_2031"">I went a head with what little savings I had and paid for a couple days of treatment..Wow, it was well worth it..

</div></div>","My Goal
Hi! My name is Andrea Olson. I am 25, married and an Environmental Chemist working for the government in Indiana. Last May, my mom, who lives in Texas and who is ONLY 46, was diagnosed with Stage 3 colorectal cancer. Her story is below but basically for almost 10 months she has been through chemo, radiation, and different surgeries resulting from the tumor in her colon. Throughout this struggling time, she was newly spoused but her husband hasn't had the opportunity to be by her side due to a deployment to Afghanistan. He left for training before her tumor removal surgery and was deployed last August and won't return until this coming August. Throughout these months, she has been on an emotional roller coaster thinking her cancer was gone but then was recently told in February that her cancer had metastasized into her liver and lung and she was now upgraded to Stage 4. The doctor has given her 6-8 months to live without treatment. She is researching several clinics who could really help her but most are not covered by her insurance since she is finding alternative ways for treatment other than chemo.
 
With this month being National Colorectal Cancer Awareness month, I want to spread awareness and help raise money for my mom's treatment costs. I believe with more treatment she could beat the statistics and live for much longer than two years because of her age and good health. My goal is to run every mile at the Mini Marathon in Indianapolis and ask for donors to support me by donating any amount for how many miles they think I can run. I have never ran the Mini or 13.1 miles at that but will be training my butt off for the next two months and will wear a shirt supporting my mom everytime I run the trails/streets in my town. Any donations up until the Mini are acceptable and greatly appreciated also!
My mom's treatment could cost her anywhere from  $400-$1,000/day and ANY amount of money is greatly appreciated. I set my goal to $5,000 in order to expect small and dream big. I would love to pay for all of her treatment but my husband and I work for the public and it doesn't pay as much as you would think.
 
What We Need From You...
We need anything that you are willing to give:

Monetary donations (100% of all proceeds go to Mom's treatment!)
Spreading the word to all your friends or family members on Facebook or simply giving them this link so they can read about this extremely noble cause
Your thoughts and prayers

What I'm Doing for the Cause

I will be training for 2 months, prepping for the Mini in Indianapolis.  Anybody can donate any amount of money per mile that I run without stopping.
I will also be spreading the word and going from place to place telling my mom's story to build support for her.
T-shirts have been designed by us to wear while training around the town of Plainfield to share the awareness.


The Impact
There are many reasons your monetary donation is important:

My mom is waiting to start treatment until money is available
Payment is due per procedure so raising all the money I can is Vital
There is no telling how long it will be for us to start treatment without donations

Her Story

Hi my name is Felicia Player,( Lisa)
I have been diagnosed with stage 3 Colorectal Cancer and here is my story..
First of all I want to say Thank you God for giving me breath and the strength to be able to endure today and have the strength to write this story..
I am a 46 year old female a newly spouse of Michael Player, who is currently deployed to Afghanistan with the Military.
I am a mother of five beautiful children and one Awesome grandson who is 11 years old.
On May 2, 2012 a trio to the Emergency Room, started a different pathway to a life that I have always taken for granted, a life that I thought I would  grow old and gray, sitting on the front porch in a rocking chair with my Husband looking around at the kids and grandkids and talking about the memories we have shared over the years that we have been together.
On May 2, 2012 that vision was quickly changed. My husband, at the time was currently deployed to Germany for a month long mission. I found myself alone at home feeling very nauseated and having severe abdominal cramps. I thought laying down for a while might subside the symptoms, but after a few hours the symptoms was getting worse and I started to feel faint. Since being all alone, I started getting really scared and called the ambulance before I blacked out. By the time I reached the hospital, my symptoms were even worse. I couldnt imagine what was going on with me. Being there by myself and going through all these symptoms, I just wanted to be near my husband and kids.
The Dr after a few hours was able to subside my symptoms and I started feeling better. The Dr came in with the results of the testing that was ran and stated it just looked like a severe case of constipation, and I thought all of that pain just because I had to use the bathroom?
The the Dr said when they did a scan they had found some darken areas that he was concerned about and ordered a colonoscopy, to make sure nothing else going on..So the trip to the ER landed me a overnight stay in the hospital..
The next day the procedure was performed..As I awoke from it, I looked over and there set my Dr right next to me holding my hand and then I looked into his face and out came the life changing words, the most devastating news that at that point changed the pathway to my life
forever. He said I am sorry to tell you this, but you have stage 3 Colorectal Cancer. The tumor was so big he couldnt even do the Colonscopy it was blocking the entrance of my colon.At that point, I thought, I am just not fully awake from the Anesthesia and it was just a bad nightmare, So I shook my head and asked the Dr what he said again, and he then repeated the diagnosis. A rush of every emotion imaginable filled my body and I thought No this cant be, I am to young, I have five kids and a grandson that desperately need me, a newly husband I was planning on spending the rest of my life with and at that moment, that vision of sitting on the front porch old and gray in the rocking chairs with my husband was shattered. I yelled No as the tears was streaming down my face, this cant be happening to me. At that moment I looked around and realized I was by myself and all I wanted was to see my husband, my kids and my family and have them near.
A week went by doing all of the neccesary preparation for the surgery for the tumor removal and the 5 lymph nodes that were affected.
Then the big day came May 7th 2012 for the surgery. Surgery was very lengthy, much longer then anticipated.The tumor was removed along with the effected lymph nodes. That next week was grueling going through recovery..But Michael was finally do home in a week so it really helped getting through it.

A few months went by and still having eating problems. And another scan was scheduled to check on the remission of the cancer which was done in end of November.. I felt positive and thought everything was going to come back ok, but everything came to a big surpirise when the  Dr came in and said that the cancer had Metastize and now moved into my liver and lungs with the cancer now being upgraded to stage 4  cancer.

<p><b>I, like most people, have a favorite brand and style of sunglasses </b>that suits me, and they have<b> expensive coated lenses</b> that make everything look clearer and crisper, and bring out colors beautifully - but the <b>optician wanted to switch out those lenses</b> for cheap tinted glass to add a bi focal lens and<b> charge me $140.00!</b></p>
<p>I ended up putting my <b>reading glasses over my sunglasses </b>- <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">and looking <i><b>completely goofy</b></i> and then<b> I saw my friends doing the same thing!

                                                    4Eyes Innovator & Founder


I developed this product from my own frustrations of not being able to find nice looking or quality made sunglasses with a bi-focal reading element, and realized all my friends had the same problem too.
I, like most people, have a favorite brand and style of sunglasses that suits me, and they have expensive coated lenses that make everything look clearer and crisper, and bring out colors beautifully - but the optician wanted to switch out those lenses for cheap tinted glass to add a bi focal lens and charge me $140.00!
I ended up putting my reading glasses over my sunglasses - and looking completely goofy and then I saw my friends doing the same thing! LOL             
           


As they say ""Necessity is the Mother of all Inventions'  So I set out to design an easy to use, easy to apply, reading lens that are optician quality and fit all types of sunglasses and safety glasses and are inexpensive.

I love solving problems and creating new products and after 20+ years in the fiber optic industry, I am mustering all that experience to create this wonderful innovative product - 4Eyes Bi -Focal Stick On Reading Lenses
So if any of those images remind you of yourself - then
 ""You don't need reading glasses - You need 4Eyes""
     
                                   
                    
BTW - I'm having a ball - it's so exciting creating something new and innovative - and especially when people say to me:

      'WOW, why hasn't someone                          created this before?""

                                                  Fashion Sunglasses
 

Celebs need help in reading too,  although none of them are endorsing 4Eyes - Yet!


                                    Even Work and Laboratory Safety Glasses
                                                       Driving and Sports




They work perfectly on any type of lens - "" Blue Blockers' 'Yellow Driving Glasses' 'Polarized' 'Mirrored' 'UV coated' - any type of lens without altering the performance of the lens.




4Eyes fits any style of sunglasses -  'Dirty Harry' wrap around, long narrow, 'Top Gun' aviators, 'Italian movie mogul', Jackie Onassis oversize, retro, or any style or design of frame - even safety and laboratory glasses!

                             Watch this short clip for the explanation:







I spent a lot of time on the design working with some of the smartest plastics and adhesive experts in the world - thank you Professor Nasiri - and the engineers at BASF Plastics and 3M Adhesives division  - making sure that the design fits all types glasses, and positions and sticks easily without any bubbles - even in high temperatures and humidity.

He lectures in S. California and is an expert in fiber optics, military and space optics and specializes in exotic plastics and substrates.
So you can be assured that 4Eyes production is under the very best production and quality control!


So at 60 years of age, I am off on a new adventure with my great friend and co-founder Professor Mohsen Nasiri - creating a brand new product to help people like myself who just want to be able to chose their style, quality and performance of sunglasses and add a reading element to them easily and inexpensively.



       My Warranty and Guarantee 

4Eyes never fade or yellow, they are UV protected and waterproof and for good measure I gave them a lifetime warranty - if anything goes wrong just send them back to me and I'll replace them free of charge - even 20 years from now!

                                                       




 Why is 4Eyes The Best Bi-Focal Lens?
                        It's all about 'Linear Eyes Movement'


We read from left to right and so I designed 4Eyes to be long in shape to accommodate out eye movement with a low profile so it is easier to see over the lens for long distance. 






  Why Do People Hate Bifocal Glasses?
             Because they probably tried on a badly designed pair!


                  Look at these terrible 'official' designs of BiFocal lenses!!


         

We read from left to right - and our eye movement is linear - horizontal - back and forth.
If the bi-focal lens is positioned badly, or the wrong size for the lens, or a bad shape, then our eyes will 'catch' the edge and disrupts our focus and eye movement and disorients our vision - very dangerous when driving or working.
If the D shape is too big (tall) then our eyes 'catch' the top edge when we are trying to see over the lens for distance - again very dangerous when driving.

         The First Bi-focal Glasses
Believe It or Not - it was Benjamin Franklin that designed the first 'bi-focal' glasses in 1750!

                                                      
He took two round glass disks, polished one to magnify and left the other clear then cut them both in half and put the 'D' shaped magnifying lens on the bottom and the clear on the top and wired them together!
There are still companies trying to peddle this out of date badly designed 'D' shape to consumers - they haven't progressed from 250 years ago - and are completely inappropriate for modern day glasses.

<p>This February of 2015, a group of 14 nurses, doctors, scientists and researchers will embark on a trip to Fonfrede, Haiti with Jean Pierre-Louis, Founder and Executive Director of CapraCare.  April of 2015 will mark CapraCare's 6th year anniversary as an organization.   </p>
<p>Since the inception of CapraCare, we continue to learn from our past efforts.  Our U.S team and Haitian team, along with the community we serve share this pragmatic approach, which ensures consistency and stability. During the weeklong journey, our U.S team will conduct meetings with the organization's Community Advisory Members; our staff working in Haiti, community partners and leaders, the people we serve, and other stakeholders.  As an organization, we believe that nothing should be done for the community without direct community involvement. </p><p>This trip will allow a group of physicians, nurses currently attending the B.S.N program at Monroe College in Bronx, NY and its nurse administrators to share their skill with the Haitian team and provide care of the community of Fronfrede. Additionally, an environmental health professor at Brooklyn college will be leading a mosquito prevention project with a group of her students who are currently working towards their masters in public health.</p>
<p>Since 2009, despite ever-changing challenges, CapraCare has put together a dynamic group of 20 core Haitian staff volunteers, who have received extensive heath care education and who have developed the skills necessary to promote and sustain improved health outcomes for the 20,000 people living in the rural community of Fonfrede, Haiti. CapraCare has continued to demonstrate that the organization's programs have been making an impact by saving lives and maintaining local capacity in Fonfrede, Haiti. </p>
<p>If you never believed in positive change in Haiti, CapraCare is now your reason to believe. Your continued support will help the organization provide access to basic health services to 20,000 Haitians in need. </p>
<p>Please help CapraCare raise $2,500 to help support the efforts of the U.S team during their week of work within the community in Fonfrede, Haiti. </p>
<p>A donation as small as $1 or as much as you are able will support the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Assist more than 20 community members of CapraCare’s staff to develop leadership skills</li>
<li>Promote community awareness of health care issues to 20,000 Haitians in Fonfrede, Haiti</li>
<li>Enhance the coordination of health care services among NGO’s serving Haitians to prevent the duplication of services</li>
</ul>
<p>About CapraCare:</p>
<p>CapraCare is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization whose mission is to develop sustainable community health programs assisting school-aged children 5-19 years old and their families living in Fonfrede, Haiti.  Fondrede has a population of 20,000, whose families were severely impacted by the 2010 earthquake.

<p>Balance 180 is a non-profit organization in Gainesville, Florida.
Our mission is to develop a new model for recreational and competitive sports
within our community that serves children and young people with varying
abilities and needs. Our goal is to <b>give all children an opportunity to participate</b> in
sports, while encouraging them to learn and grow to realize their unique
potential. We strive to serve the whole child, recognizing that kids benefit
from lots of encouragement, a positive environment and opportunities to
succeed. </p>

<p>“Is there a place where children who are less coordinated or that have a disability can enjoy gymnastics
and benefit from the physical activity?” That was co-founders Krista
Vandenborne’s and Carsten Schmalfuss’ question. As health care professionals
with daughters who participated in competitive gymnastics, they recognized
something was missing and were determined to do something about it. In their
view, children needed a place where they could receive the support to
excel and enjoy sports, regardless of their ability. From this need came
Balance 180, a place where children can learn gymnastics skills, make new friends,
and feel a sense of belonging. With a generous community and a large number of
students and health professionals, Gainesville, Florida has allowed us to create a
unique program that benefits children with varying abilities. </p>

<p>Balance 180 is an exciting place, which offers both recreational
and adaptive gymnastics classes for kids ages 2 to 14 years old. Each class is
staffed with positive, energetic coaches and volunteers that can provide
assistance where needed. The kids learn forward rolls, handstands,
cartwheels, pullovers on bars, and many more traditional gymnastics skills. In
just over one year, we have grown from serving 14 athletes to almost 150. This growth
indicates that the need for a program like Balance 180 exists. One
appreciative parent commented:<b> ""<i>These classes are an amazing asset to the
special needs community</i>.""  </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>This past summer we also offered the first inclusive gymnastics
camp in Alachua County, integrating children with and without disabilities. The
camp was a tremendous success and we all had lots of fun. Gymnastics classes
were supplemented with art projects, dancing and games. All of the kids exercised and
played together, and warming-up and stretching quickly became a group activity they looked forward to. And of course there was snack-time, a time for everybody to
relax and share stories. For many of our athletes this was their first camp
EVER, and what an experience it was! One of the parents of a young boy with
Down Syndrome sent us a grateful email after camp which read: <i><b>“I am so excited that my son had an active 3
weeks that kept him exercising.”  </b></i></p>

<p>One cannot think of Balance 180 without reflecting on the
dedication of our amazing volunteers. Our volunteer base ranges from 100 to 120
volunteers each semester, and they have cumulatively logged over <b>5,000 hours</b> <b>of
service</b>. Most of the volunteers are students committed to a career in education
or health care and they appreciate the experience of working with our young
athletes. We are proud of the training we provide to our volunteers and hope
they take the lessons and memories into their future endeavors. All of our volunteers are wonderful young
people focused on creating a positive environment to support our athletes and
help them thrive, independent of their ability. </p>

<p>In the adaptive gymnastics classes, the curriculum and lesson
plans are adapted to each child’s specific needs. The athletes learn skills on
vault, bars, beam, and floor with the assistance of one or two
dedicated volunteers. The focus is on ensuring the athletes can be successful
in each of the activities. The gym often gets filled with a lot of cheering and encouragement.
A parent recently commented that for her child,<b> “<i>Coming to the gym for one hour makes her entire week</i>.”</b> Our goal is
to ensure each child realizes they are special, that we care, and that together
with us they can always learn new skills. Our athletes and volunteers laugh,
play, exercise, and have fun together each week. </p>

<p>Physical education programs can significantly improve the
lifestyle of a child with disabilities. In addition to guarding against obesity
and promoting an active lifestyle, physical activity improves a
child's motivation and self-image. Sports like gymnastics help a child build
important motor skills, core strength, balance and coordination, but it is also
a wonderful way to learn how to follow directions, focus, and build social
skills. The athletes learn from our coaches and volunteers, but they learn even
more from interacting with their peers.</p>
<p>The less tangible benefits from our program include the sense of
accomplishment each child experiences when they learn something new. At the end
of each class, the athletes are rewarded with star stickers on a chart that
tracks their mastery of new skills, which can range from somersaults to
walking on a balance beam. The gym is always full of positive energy with cheers, hugs, and high fives. Our goal is to make sure
that each child knows that we care!</p>

enjoy gymnastics and sports!Tumbling to a better tomorrow!

Thank you
for joining us on this adventure, and please enjoy our story that is full of
flips, fun, and friendship. Our athletes hold a meaningful place in our hearts,
and we hope that we can show the world just how special they are. 

Balance 180 BragsBalance 180 highlighted in collection of great special needs groups and activitiesBalance 180 is so grateful and honored to have been selected as a tops special needs activity by PhDinSpecialEducation.com!

Be sure to check out #46! Fall 2013 Culminating Event another success!Balance 180 had another great Culminating Event for the Fall 2013 session of one of our programs for children with special needs. We are appreciative for our GTN News feature by Briana Harper, following the event. Check out the story and video here!Athletes featured in article in Home magazineBe sure to check out pages 118-121 in Home: Living in the Heart of Florida magazine's December 2013/January 2014 for a great article by Chris Eversole on Balance 180. What is Balance 180?


Balance 180 is a non-profit organization in Gainesville, Florida.
Our mission is to develop a new model for recreational and competitive sports
within our community that serves children and young people with varying
abilities and needs. Our goal is to give all children an opportunity to participate in
sports, while encouraging them to learn and grow to realize their unique
potential. We strive to serve the whole child, recognizing that kids benefit
from lots of encouragement, a positive environment and opportunities to
succeed. 


How did it all begin?




“Is there a place where children who are less coordinated or that have a disability can enjoy gymnastics
and benefit from the physical activity?” That was co-founders Krista
Vandenborne’s and Carsten Schmalfuss’ question. As health care professionals
with daughters who participated in competitive gymnastics, they recognized
something was missing and were determined to do something about it. In their
view, children needed a place where they could receive the support to
excel and enjoy sports, regardless of their ability. From this need came
Balance 180, a place where children can learn gymnastics skills, make new friends,
and feel a sense of belonging. With a generous community and a large number of
students and health professionals, Gainesville, Florida has allowed us to create a
unique program that benefits children with varying abilities. 
What happens at Balance 180 and what has been accomplished
in the first year?

Balance 180 is an exciting place, which offers both recreational
and adaptive gymnastics classes for kids ages 2 to 14 years old. Each class is
staffed with positive, energetic coaches and volunteers that can provide
assistance where needed. The kids learn forward rolls, handstands,
cartwheels, pullovers on bars, and many more traditional gymnastics skills. In
just over one year, we have grown from serving 14 athletes to almost 150. This growth
indicates that the need for a program like Balance 180 exists. One
appreciative parent commented: ""These classes are an amazing asset to the
special needs community.""  
This past summer we also offered the first inclusive gymnastics
camp in Alachua County, integrating children with and without disabilities. The
camp was a tremendous success and we all had lots of fun. Gymnastics classes
were supplemented with art projects, dancing and games. All of the kids exercised and
played together, and warming-up and stretching quickly became a group activity they looked forward to. And of course there was snack-time, a time for everybody to
relax and share stories. For many of our athletes this was their first camp
EVER, and what an experience it was! One of the parents of a young boy with
Down Syndrome sent us a grateful email after camp which read: “I am so excited that my son had an active 3
weeks that kept him exercising.”  
Who are all of our wonderful
volunteers?

One cannot think of Balance 180 without reflecting on the
dedication of our amazing volunteers. Our volunteer base ranges from 100 to 120
volunteers each semester, and they have cumulatively logged over 5,000 hours of
service. Most of the volunteers are students committed to a career in education
or health care and they appreciate the experience of working with our young
athletes. We are proud of the training we provide to our volunteers and hope
they take the lessons and memories into their future endeavors. All of our volunteers are wonderful young
people focused on creating a positive environment to support our athletes and
help them thrive, independent of their ability. 
What is the adaptive gymnastics class
and how is it different?


In the adaptive gymnastics classes, the curriculum and lesson
plans are adapted to each child’s specific needs. The athletes learn skills on
vault, bars, beam, and floor with the assistance of one or two
dedicated volunteers. The focus is on ensuring the athletes can be successful
in each of the activities. The gym often gets filled with a lot of cheering and encouragement.
A parent recently commented that for her child, “Coming to the gym for one hour makes her entire week.” Our goal is
to ensure each child realizes they are special, that we care, and that together
with us they can always learn new skills. Our athletes and volunteers laugh,
play, exercise, and have fun together each week. 
What are the benefits of gymnastics?

Physical education programs can significantly improve the
lifestyle of a child with disabilities. In addition to guarding against obesity
and promoting an active lifestyle, physical activity improves a
child's motivation and self-image. Sports like gymnastics help a child build
important motor skills, core strength, balance and coordination, but it is also
a wonderful way to learn how to follow directions, focus, and build social
skills. The athletes learn from our coaches and volunteers, but they learn even
more from interacting with their peers.
The less tangible benefits from our program include the sense of
accomplishment each child experiences when they learn something new. At the end
of each class, the athletes are rewarded with star stickers on a chart that
tracks their mastery of new skills, which can range from somersaults to
walking on a balance beam. The gym is always full of positive energy with cheers, hugs, and high fives. Our goal is to make sure
that each child knows that we care!
Where do we see ourselves in the future?

Today we serve about 150 kids in the Gainesville community, about
60 of which have special needs. This is a small portion of the kids that could
eventually benefit from our programs. Through our fundraising efforts, we hope
to accommodate many more kids and provide additional scholarships for athletes
who need financial assistance. We hope to expand and advance our classes, and offer summer camp to a larger group of kids. 
Balance 180, its coaches, and volunteers have a lot of heart, passion, and
expertise; however, there is SO MUCH MORE we can accomplish with your support! Our vision is to offer
our services five days a week and have kids exercise side by side, independent
of their ability, cheering each other on when they learn and accomplish new
skills. ALL kids need to feel empowered with a sense of success and
accomplishment, and enjoy the opportunity to create lasting friendships.   


What can you do to help?
Balance
180 does not receive any federal or state support, so we are highly dependent on
the generosity of individual donations and corporate sponsorships. As part of
this campaign, our goal is to raise at least $15,000, which will go towards covering
some of our expenses such as:


Athlete
scholarships


Rental
of our practice facility


Fans to keep the gym cool...We don't have AC
and Florida gets HOT!


Equipment: Safety mats, high beams, bars, etc.


Apparel: shorts, t-shirts, and leotards


Transportation to field trips during summer
camp


Intern and coach stipends 


Materials
to raise community awareness


Training
of volunteers and interns


Scholarships are our top priority to ensure
that no child is left out due to financial restraints. Our low monthly tuition
cost can still be too expensive for some families as many are dealing with
significant medical expenses.
Your
contribution is not just a donation, it is an investment in the future of our
children and our community. No matter how small or how large
the gift, your generosity will have a tremendous impact on the life of a child.
Please join us in making a difference!

Please note: When you donate, your receipt will say
""Jordan Klausner Foundation"". The Jordan Klausner Foundation, a
registered 501(c)(3) organization, is the fiscal sponsor of Balance 180
Gymnastics & Sports Academy, a non-profit corporation in the State of
Florida. Donations to Balance 180 Gymnastics & Sports Academy via the
Jordan Klausner Foundation are tax-deductible.
How else can you
help?

While your donation is certainly appreciated to help us grow and
run our programs, there is another way you can have an impact. Please help us
share our story and campaign with your friends, families, and coworkers and
direct them to this Indiegogo Campaign. Also, please
share our video to help us get the word out about our incredible athletes. Sharing
our story will increase our chances of reaching our goal and offering our
program to the kids who need it the most.  
Finally, be sure to follow us on Twitter and like us on Facebook for updates on our athletes and our
progress towards our fundraising goal! Thank
YOU for making a difference, and supporting Balance 180 and our athletes.",14.0,0,"4 Campaigns

We shall immediately proceed to the developments of Android version and some new features for the 2nd stage. These new features and improvements are aiming to enhance and improve the user experience which we are not capable in the 1st stage of development.  
LifeZoop project was kicked off in Jul , 2013 and its initial capital is financed by team crews. The App is expected to launch for download in Apps markets in Oct this year. 85~90% of the 1st stage tasks have been done now and our software programmers are being busy in the rest tasks and user experience test as well. We are confident that LifeZoop App of iOS will be available in timely manner.

Yet to make the LifeZoop App powerful and popular, there are still a lot to be done in the future. These tasks are very important to complete the functions and perfect the user experience of LifeZoop. Please help us to finish the last mile of this App. 
Here is the breakdown of what we need from you : 


2nd stage of iOS version : $4,000 
Android Version : $15,000
Perfection of User Interface : $9,000
Advertisement Platform : $11,000
Improvement of Backbone efficiency : $5,000







The charms in return 


LifeZoop is is not a hardware, therefore, it cannot be acquired at discounted prices. LifeZoop is an App for free download as we like more people can take this App to record their wonderful lives.  

We have been thinking what perks would be useful to the potential contributors to LifeZoop project. Suddenly, we found our traditional ""charms"" could represent our appreciation to our contributors. The charm is made of wood and painted in red. Each charm has special meaning in Mandarin. You can find the respective translation in English under each charm in the following figure. The charms represent our sincere bless from bottom of our hearts and we wish you like it.





We also believe good thing would be better done by more people.  It is preferable that more people support us each with smaller amount of money instead of less people with bigger amount. We really wish more people could receive the charms. The charms is handy and can be used in many ways in life. Check this out ! 










Infinite Thanks At last, we really appreciate your time and patience for reading this message through. We wish you a better life no matter you will support us or not. 
Furthermore, at this moment, let's bless all Syrian innocent people staying alive and free from persecution and war.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>We want to expand on a global level, but act on a local level<br/>That means that we will find local remedies in each market we enter to reduce transport &amp; treat with proven meds. It means to find local charities that engage and need help </li>
<li>We want to create what people need<br/>That does not mean; what people want. People dont necessary know what they want. You dont go to the dentist and complete the act yourself, do you? We listen to what is really the best remedies out there at the moment and portion them with a doctor for best result.</li>
<li>We want to do more.<br/>We find the potential in this project to be huge. And we are open to feedback and suggestions. If you have an idea of how we could help or partner up, please contact us. Joel is unemployed, he can answer emails all day long. No more ""Summer of George"" for him.</li>
<li>We want continue to improve<br/>Flupal+ should be an experience for you. We want to make your sick time more pleasant were constantly looking for medicines and products.

<p>RISK: One risk is that the medical manufacturers have trouble to assemble the product in a fashion that is required for easy shipping and a joyful experience. We have high demands on the end product but also tight margins since we deal with charity. More orders, better bargaining position, better products and more to charity.</p>
<p>SOLUTION: Our secret weapon is a highly respected e-commerce investor in London, Pete. He does not look like the guy on the picture. He is a partner in Flupal and does not like when suppliers dont fulfill their part of the agreement. If this happens, he´ll be on the next flight to the US to sort it out. And he is not afraid of flying. He has so much miles on his frequent-flyer he could fly to the sun. We would like to put his real picture here to raise some trust. But we are not allowed to expose him. He told us he need to kill us if we do so. And he is a lot older and we´re not sure if he knows about sarcasm and all that.</p>

We want to create what people needThat does not mean; what people want. People dont necessary know what they want. You dont go to the dentist and complete the act yourself, do you? We listen to what is really the best remedies out there at the moment and portion them with a doctor for best result.
We want to do more.We find the potential in this project to be huge. And we are open to feedback and suggestions. If you have an idea of how we could help or partner up, please contact us. Joel is unemployed, he can answer emails all day long. No more ""Summer of George"" for him.
We want continue to improveFlupal+ should be an experience for you. We want to make your sick time more pleasant were constantly looking for medicines and products. We also look into products and services that could entertain you while you're sick. Do you have any ideas for that? As we said; Joel is going to have a lot of time.









RISK: One risk is that the medical manufacturers have trouble to assemble the product in a fashion that is required for easy shipping and a joyful experience. We have high demands on the end product but also tight margins since we deal with charity. More orders, better bargaining position, better products and more to charity.
SOLUTION: Our secret weapon is a highly respected e-commerce investor in London, Pete. He does not look like the guy on the picture. He is a partner in Flupal and does not like when suppliers dont fulfill their part of the agreement. If this happens, he´ll be on the next flight to the US to sort it out. And he is not afraid of flying. He has so much miles on his frequent-flyer he could fly to the sun. We would like to put his real picture here to raise some trust. But we are not allowed to expose him. He told us he need to kill us if we do so. And he is a lot older and we´re not sure if he knows about sarcasm and all that.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Ce projet vise à financer l’adaptation
du logement aux normes handicapées de M. <b>Rached El Arbi,</b> devenu paraplégique suite à une
blessure par balle reçue au niveau de la trachée, lors des manifestation spacifiques
du 13 janvier 2011. M. El Arbi était alors âgé de 21 ans. </p>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">Rached fut donné pour mort après qu'un sniper lui a tiré dessus devant le poste du commissariat du Mornag, dans la banlieue de Tunis. La révolution tunisienne a fait plus de 350 morts et près de 2600 blessés.</span><h3><br/></h3>
<p>M.
El Arbi a été inclut dans la liste officielle des « martyrs »  établie par la Commission d’Enquête sur crimes
de la révolution, qui peut être téléchargé ici (en arabe): <a href=""http://archive.mosaiquefm.net/assets/documents/pdf/RAPPORT-04052012.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://archive.mosaiquefm.net/assets/documents/pdf/RAPPORT-04052012.pdf</a> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>La
famille El Arbi a donc reçu du gouvernement tunisien, dans le cadre de
l’application du décret-loi n°97 relatif aux martyrs et blessés de la
révolution, un montant fixe de 6 000 Dinars (environ 2800 EUR), en deux versements, destinés à
couvrir les soins médicaux. Ce montant s’est avéré largement insuffisant aux
nombreuses interventions médicales nécessaires à la survie de Rached, et la
famille s’est donc vue dépendre de l’aide d’acteurs privés (collectes,
donations, bénévoles…). M. El Arbi a en effet dû subir plus de 6 opérations depuis 2011. Plus que l'argent, Rached demande pourtant, d'abord, la reconnaissance de son statut de martyr héros de la révolution tunisienne, première du ""Printemps Arabe"", et de retrouve sa dignité.</p>
<p>En effet, le
logement de la famille El Arbi n’est pas adapté à la nouvelle condition de
Rached, pour plusieurs raisons (entrée trop étroite, accès aux toilettes
impossible, pas de rampe pour la douche…), limitant considérablement son
autonomie, et impliquant l’intervention constante de sa mère pour effectuer les
gestes les plus simples du quotidien. La vie de la famille a été bouleversée par son handicap. <br/></p>
<p>Quelques travaux pour adapter le logement de Rached à sa situation pourraient changer la vie de la famille El Arbi. Un devis a été établi à cette fin, pour un montant de 4 000 Dinars au total.  Une ONG tunisienne, ""La Ferme Thérapeutique"", supervisera ces travaux. Son site est accessible ici: <a href=""http://www.fth.org.tn/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fth.org.tn/</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p>Jusqu’ici,
la Ferme Thérapeutique n’a pas encore travaillé directement à l’amélioration
des conditions d’habitation des personnes handicapées avec lesquelles elle
travaille. Quelques projets ont été menés cependant, en parallèle, par certains
employés de la Ferme, leur permettant d’accueillir déjà une certaine expérience
dans le suivi de ces projets.</p>
<p>Mener
à bien ce projet d’adaptation du logement, dans cette première phase pilote,
serait donc une manière de renforcer les capacités de l’association dans ce domaine,
en vue de la diversifier par la suite et de pouvoir toucher un plus grand
nombre de bénéficiaires. </p>
<p>Cette
première phase pilote sera destinée à évaluer les capacités et les besoins de
l’association dans ce domaine. Un bilan sera effectué à cette fin au terme des
travaux.</p>
<p>Il
existe aujourd’hui 6 blessés de la révolution tunisienne dans la même situation
que Rached. L’objectif est d’étendre cette action à chacun, après cette
première phase pilote.</p>
<p>La
situation de Rached a été présentée dans le cadre du court-métrage produit par
la Télévision des Nations Unies: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnmuF0njdo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnmuF0njdo</a></p>
<p><b>Une petite contribution peut donc suffir pour changer radicalement le quotidien de ces héros qui ont risqué leurs vies pour la liberté, qui méritent la reconnaissance et la dignité!</b></p>

<p><b></b>T<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">his project aims at funding home adaptations for disabled wounded of the revolution Rached El Arbi, paraplegic following a gunshot wound received at the trachea during a peaceful demonstration in January 2011. Mr. El Arbi was then 21 years old. </span></p>
<p>Rached was given up for dead after a sniper shot him in front of the police station of Mornag, in the suburbs of Tunis. The Tunisian revolution has made more than 350 dead and nearly 2,600 injured. </p>
<p>Mr. El Arbi was included in the official list of ""martyrs"" prepared by the Commission of Inquiry into crimes of the revolution, which can be downloaded here (in Arabic): <a href=""http://archive.mosaiquefm.net/assets/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://archive.mosaiquefm.net/assets/</a> documents/pdf/RAPPORT-04052012.pdf </p>
<p>As such, Rached received from the Tunisian government, under the Decree-Law No. 97 on martyrs and wounded of the revolution, a fixed amount of 6,000 dinars (approximately € 2,800) in two installments intended to cover his medical care and as a form of reparation. This amount proved largely insufficient to reimburse the many medical interventions necessary to the survival of Rached, His family was thus forced to depend on the help of private actors ( donations, volunteers ...). Mr. El Arbi has indeed endured more than 6 operations since 2011. However, more than money, what Rached demands is, first, the recognition of his status as a martyr and hero of the Tunisian revolution, the first of the so-called ""Arab Spring"", and hopes to regain his dignity. </p>
<p>The home of the El Arbi family indeed is not adapted to the new condition of Rached, for several reasons (the entry is too narrow, there is no direct access to the toilets, no ramp for the shower ...), greatly limiting his autonomy and demanding the constant intervention of his mother to perform the simplest of everyday gestures. The life of the entire family was shattered by his new disability. </p>
<p>A simple work to adapt Rached's house to his new condition could therefore change the lives of the family El Arbi. An estimate has been established for this purpose, for an amount of 4,000 dinars in total (about 1500 EUR). A Tunisian NGO called ""The Therapeutic Farm"", specialized in working with people with disabilities, will oversee this work.

</div><br/></div>","Ce projet vise à financer l’adaptation
du logement aux normes handicapées de M. Rached El Arbi, devenu paraplégique suite à une
blessure par balle reçue au niveau de la trachée, lors des manifestation spacifiques
du 13 janvier 2011. M. El Arbi était alors âgé de 21 ans. 
Rached fut donné pour mort après qu'un sniper lui a tiré dessus devant le poste du commissariat du Mornag, dans la banlieue de Tunis. La révolution tunisienne a fait plus de 350 morts et près de 2600 blessés.
M.
El Arbi a été inclut dans la liste officielle des « martyrs »  établie par la Commission d’Enquête sur crimes
de la révolution, qui peut être téléchargé ici (en arabe): http://archive.mosaiquefm.net/assets/documents/pdf/RAPPORT-04052012.pdf 


La
famille El Arbi a donc reçu du gouvernement tunisien, dans le cadre de
l’application du décret-loi n°97 relatif aux martyrs et blessés de la
révolution, un montant fixe de 6 000 Dinars (environ 2800 EUR), en deux versements, destinés à
couvrir les soins médicaux. Ce montant s’est avéré largement insuffisant aux
nombreuses interventions médicales nécessaires à la survie de Rached, et la
famille s’est donc vue dépendre de l’aide d’acteurs privés (collectes,
donations, bénévoles…). M. El Arbi a en effet dû subir plus de 6 opérations depuis 2011. Plus que l'argent, Rached demande pourtant, d'abord, la reconnaissance de son statut de martyr héros de la révolution tunisienne, première du ""Printemps Arabe"", et de retrouve sa dignité.
En effet, le
logement de la famille El Arbi n’est pas adapté à la nouvelle condition de
Rached, pour plusieurs raisons (entrée trop étroite, accès aux toilettes
impossible, pas de rampe pour la douche…), limitant considérablement son
autonomie, et impliquant l’intervention constante de sa mère pour effectuer les
gestes les plus simples du quotidien. La vie de la famille a été bouleversée par son handicap. 
Quelques travaux pour adapter le logement de Rached à sa situation pourraient changer la vie de la famille El Arbi. Un devis a été établi à cette fin, pour un montant de 4 000 Dinars au total.  Une ONG tunisienne, ""La Ferme Thérapeutique"", supervisera ces travaux. Son site est accessible ici: http://www.fth.org.tn/ 

Jusqu’ici,
la Ferme Thérapeutique n’a pas encore travaillé directement à l’amélioration
des conditions d’habitation des personnes handicapées avec lesquelles elle
travaille. Quelques projets ont été menés cependant, en parallèle, par certains
employés de la Ferme, leur permettant d’accueillir déjà une certaine expérience
dans le suivi de ces projets.
Mener
à bien ce projet d’adaptation du logement, dans cette première phase pilote,
serait donc une manière de renforcer les capacités de l’association dans ce domaine,
en vue de la diversifier par la suite et de pouvoir toucher un plus grand
nombre de bénéficiaires. 
Cette
première phase pilote sera destinée à évaluer les capacités et les besoins de
l’association dans ce domaine. Un bilan sera effectué à cette fin au terme des
travaux.
Il
existe aujourd’hui 6 blessés de la révolution tunisienne dans la même situation
que Rached. L’objectif est d’étendre cette action à chacun, après cette
première phase pilote.
La
situation de Rached a été présentée dans le cadre du court-métrage produit par
la Télévision des Nations Unies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDnmuF0njdo
Une petite contribution peut donc suffir pour changer radicalement le quotidien de ces héros qui ont risqué leurs vies pour la liberté, qui méritent la reconnaissance et la dignité!

This project aims at funding home adaptations for disabled wounded of the revolution Rached El Arbi, paraplegic following a gunshot wound received at the trachea during a peaceful demonstration in January 2011. Mr. El Arbi was then 21 years old. 
Rached was given up for dead after a sniper shot him in front of the police station of Mornag, in the suburbs of Tunis. The Tunisian revolution has made more than 350 dead and nearly 2,600 injured. 
Mr. El Arbi was included in the official list of ""martyrs"" prepared by the Commission of Inquiry into crimes of the revolution, which can be downloaded here (in Arabic): http://archive.mosaiquefm.net/assets/ documents/pdf/RAPPORT-04052012.pdf 
As such, Rached received from the Tunisian government, under the Decree-Law No. 97 on martyrs and wounded of the revolution, a fixed amount of 6,000 dinars (approximately € 2,800) in two installments intended to cover his medical care and as a form of reparation. This amount proved largely insufficient to reimburse the many medical interventions necessary to the survival of Rached, His family was thus forced to depend on the help of private actors ( donations, volunteers ...). Mr. El Arbi has indeed endured more than 6 operations since 2011. However, more than money, what Rached demands is, first, the recognition of his status as a martyr and hero of the Tunisian revolution, the first of the so-called ""Arab Spring"", and hopes to regain his dignity. 
The home of the El Arbi family indeed is not adapted to the new condition of Rached, for several reasons (the entry is too narrow, there is no direct access to the toilets, no ramp for the shower ...), greatly limiting his autonomy and demanding the constant intervention of his mother to perform the simplest of everyday gestures. The life of the entire family was shattered by his new disability. 
A simple work to adapt Rached's house to his new condition could therefore change the lives of the family El Arbi. An estimate has been established for this purpose, for an amount of 4,000 dinars in total (about 1500 EUR). A Tunisian NGO called ""The Therapeutic Farm"", specialized in working with people with disabilities, will oversee this work. Their website is available here: http://www.fth.org.tn/ 
So far, the Therapeutic Farm has not worked directly for the improvement of living conditions of people with disabilities. Similar projects have been completed, however, in parallel, by individual employees of the Farm, allowing them to gain some experience in monitoring these projects. 
Carry out this project of adapting Rached's home, in this first pilot phase, would therefore be a way to strengthen the capacity of the organization in this area, and thereafter to reach a larger number of beneficiaries. 
There are now six wounded of the Tunisian revolution in the same situation as Rached. The goal of this project of course is to expand this help to all of them, and give them the dignity they deserve.

Thank you for your interest in our campaign to start an integrated health clinic. RoseHeal is the combined practices of myself and my wife Sunny Rose Healey.  Together we offer Ayurvedic Medicine, Colon Hydrotherapy, Core Synchronism, Reflexology, Polarity Therapy, Flower Essence Therapy and Womens Health. When we met in 2007 as students at The Ayurvedic Institute in Albuquerque, NM, we’d both come from deep roots in yoga. Sunny owned a successful yoga studio in Salt Lake City, and I’d been teaching several years in  North Carolina. In 2009 Sunny received her certification as an Ayurvedic Practitioner and joined the faculty at the Ayurvedic Institute.

RoseHeal is the combined practices of myself and my wife Sunny Rose Healey.  Together we offer Ayurvedic Medicine, Colon Hydrotherapy, Core Synchronism, Reflexology, Polarity Therapy, Flower Essence Therapy and Womens Health. When we met in 2007 as students at The Ayurvedic Institute in Albuquerque, NM, we’d both come from deep roots in yoga. Sunny owned a successful yoga studio in Salt Lake City, and I’d been teaching several years in  North Carolina. In 2009 Sunny received her certification as an Ayurvedic Practitioner and joined the faculty at the Ayurvedic Institute. She currently manages the Institute’s clinic, teaches Ayurvedic Medicine in multiple institutions, is working on a degree in holistic midwifery and apprenticing to be a midwife.
