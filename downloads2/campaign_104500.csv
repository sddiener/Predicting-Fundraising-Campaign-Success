¿Quienes Somos? (About Us)  Hola, Somos  Miguel  y Alicia cofundadores  de Applause Contenidos
Digitales, una micro empresa (startup) con una visión social, que esta comenzando con el propósito de desarrollar tecnología móvil:  Apps - Videogames que generen un impacto positivo a  nuestra sociedad.
Hi, we are Miguel and Alicia, we are Co-founders of Applause Contenidos Digitales, its a Start Up that is beginning with the vision to develop application for mobile devices and digital contents like animations, video games that generate a positive impact in the community besides to generate appreciation. 
Nuestro Propósito (Our Goal)
Vamos a desarrollar KidsKademmy: Una serie de vídeo juegos de aventura, que tiene inmerso en su historia una terapia diseñada por un especialista en dificultades del aprendizaje, para ayudar a niños que tienen dislexia a superar esta dificultad.

We are developing KidsKademmy, it is a video game adventure series that has immersed into its history a therapy designed by a specialist in learning disabilities.
With Kidskademmy we can help to children with dyslexia  overcome this disability.




¿Por que esto es importante? ( Why that is important)

He aquí unas razones:


La dislexia afecta al 15% de la población del mundo.(http://kidshealth.org/parent/en_espanol/general...)


Más
del 10% de los niños del mundo padecen de dislexia. Eso es más de 200
millones de niños.


Los niños con dislexia Tendrán
dificultad para: leer, escribir, vocalizar, entender.


Los niños con dislexia serán,
diagnosticados equivocadamente como niños con problemas emocionales
o sicológicos.


A los niños con dislexia en muchas ocasiones se
les considerará: perezosos, desinteresados, tontos, y esto afectara su identidad y estima propia.


Con
el paso del tiempo no superarán esta dificultad, Solo superaran la dislexia con
terapia especial.


Here are some reasons:

Dyslexia affects 15 percent of the world population (http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/learning/d...)
More
than 10% of the world’s children suffer dyslexia, that’s more
than 200 million kids.
They
will have difficulties to read, to write, to vocalize and even
understand.

They
will be misdiagnosed as children with emotional and psychological
issues.

TThey
would be considered as lazy, un-interested, handicap, and even
affecting their self-esteem.ime
won’t only heal, this learning disorder.These
children will overcome this difficulty with a special therapy.















  ¿Por que vamos a ofrecer esta terapia por medio de los videojuegos? 


Los niños aman los videojuegos !!! 
Las mecánicas de los juegos de vídeo implementan las técnicas de terapia de aprendizaje fácilmente.
El progreso del niño se da, 
dentro de un marco de diversión y sin ningún tipo de presión. 
Con las tiendas para dispositivos móviles, personas, 
niños de diferentes lugares, ciudades y países, de zonas remotas y alejadas
pueden acceder a descargar el videojuego con la terapia.
Los niños de bajos recursos tendrán acceso a la terapia  ya que los  pueden tener en sus dispositivos: en sus teléfonos  móviles o tabletas digitales.

Why therapeutic videogames?

The kids love…. Videogames!!! 
The mechanics of video games can easily implement the techniques of therapy.

Videogames will ensure that the child’s progress is given
within a frame of fun and without any kind of pressure (stress) 

Now with
the mobile devices stores, people and children who live in different places, cities,
countries and in remote areas, have access to download the game with the therapy. 

The children belonged to low-income families can have access to the videogames
since they can get them from their devices, mobile phones and tablets.

<p>My name is <strong>Mijail</strong> Casas and I am the lead developer of <strong>Fireblitz Games</strong>, the ""<strong>One Man</strong>"" studio that has been developing ""Charlie"" since <strong>January 2018</strong>.<br/>In these first two years of development I have developed <strong>65% of the game</strong>. Things like the main code of the game, UI design, design and animations of ""Charlie"" or the multiplayer logic are stuff that are already finished. That means the game is already a <strong>real game</strong> and you can create online matches to play with other people, you can handle both Charlie and survivors.</p>

<p><strong>Why am I here?</strong><br/>Well, these<strong> two years of development</strong> have been quite <strong>hard</strong>, the <strong>workload</strong> I've been subjected to has been greater than I initially thought. The<strong> project</strong> has been <strong>growing</strong> and <strong>evolving</strong> as it was being developed and also certain demands from the project's followers have made it worthwhile to make it a little <strong>bigger and better</strong>.</p>
<p>And this is where this Indiegogo campaign comes in and makes sense.<br/>Currently it is necessary to design many of the models of the characters (Survivors) of the game, their skins and unlockable content as well as it is necessary to continue working on the design of the maps and improving some aspects of the gameplay in order to create the perfect game experience.</p>
<p>To do this I need to hire a group of artists and other specialists to help me give the final push that ""Charlie"" needs to live up to his expectations.</p>
<p>With that extra help we can<strong> finish the game in less time</strong> and at the same time we can have a <strong>better product </strong>to offer the players.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>· SURVIVORS ·</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The <strong>goal</strong> in a ""Charlie"" <strong>match</strong> will be different depending on whether you choose to play as a <strong>doll</strong> or a <strong>survivor</strong>.<br/>As a Survivor you will have to take into account several factors in order to <strong>successfully</strong> finish the match.<br/>Each survivor has <strong>3 chances</strong> to reach their goal. This means that you can <strong>reappear</strong> in the match if you are eliminated a maximum of <strong>3 times</strong>. From then on, you will have to <strong>wait until the match is over</strong> or two of your<strong> teammates bring you back using a ""ritual""</strong>.</p>

Play as Charlie and defeat the other players or face Charlie as a survivor.


My name is Mijail Casas and I am the lead developer of Fireblitz Games, the ""One Man"" studio that has been developing ""Charlie"" since January 2018.In these first two years of development I have developed 65% of the game. Things like the main code of the game, UI design, design and animations of ""Charlie"" or the multiplayer logic are stuff that are already finished. That means the game is already a real game and you can create online matches to play with other people, you can handle both Charlie and survivors.




Why am I here?Well, these two years of development have been quite hard, the workload I've been subjected to has been greater than I initially thought. The project has been growing and evolving as it was being developed and also certain demands from the project's followers have made it worthwhile to make it a little bigger and better.
And this is where this Indiegogo campaign comes in and makes sense.Currently it is necessary to design many of the models of the characters (Survivors) of the game, their skins and unlockable content as well as it is necessary to continue working on the design of the maps and improving some aspects of the gameplay in order to create the perfect game experience.
To do this I need to hire a group of artists and other specialists to help me give the final push that ""Charlie"" needs to live up to his expectations.
With that extra help we can finish the game in less time and at the same time we can have a better product to offer the players.

 

· SURVIVORS ·
The goal in a ""Charlie"" match will be different depending on whether you choose to play as a doll or a survivor.As a Survivor you will have to take into account several factors in order to successfully finish the match.Each survivor has 3 chances to reach their goal. This means that you can reappear in the match if you are eliminated a maximum of 3 times. From then on, you will have to wait until the match is over or two of your teammates bring you back using a ""ritual"".
 

 
You must be careful because you will have reduced health compared to ""Charlie"" and although you can regain your health using first aid kits, these are limited and you must take into account that the rest of the survivors will also want to use them.

As a survivor you will have two ways to end the match successfully. Escape from the map alive or defeat Charlie.In order to escape from the map you will have to follow several steps that will be different depending on the map you are in. Knowing how to play your cards properly and not wasting time will be key to achieving this.If time runs out or you don't see the possibility of escaping from the map, there is also the option of defeating Charlie.The first option would be to kill him 3 times since those are the lives he has. But be careful, Charlie's health is 10 times greater than a survivor's health and you will have to deal with all the powers that the doll has.
 

 
The second option to defeat Charlie is to make him go back to hell. It will not be easy and it will be a task that will have to be carried out among several survivors.
Will you have the courage to be a real survivor? 
 



 
· CHARLIE ·
Playing as Charlie will have all the powers of a dark demon in your hands. But obviously you'll have to save your strength so that you don't stand unarmed in front of the survivors who decide to fight you.
 

 
Charlie will have a lot of health and 3 lives that you will have to take care of if you don't want the survivors to escape.Charlie's skills are unique and special, useful for every situation and their use will require a certain strategy that if carried out carefully can lead you to success.
 

 
Claw Attack, Dark Fire, Shield, Detection, Teleport or Possession are some of Charlie's skills that you can use to take on the survivors.

You'll also have the extra help of ""Scavengers"" that you can invoke at certain points on the map and that will keep the survivors ""busy"" while you carry out your evil plans.

 
 
Charlie also has the option to recover his health by collecting dark orbs.
These orbs will not be easy to find and will only add a small amount of health but will be very useful when you only have one life and need a little help to finish the match.
 

 
Charlie's darkest skill and the one for which the survivors must take the most care is ""Possession"".
 
 
This skill fills up as the match progresses and with every kill Charlie performs. When available, Charlie will be able to possess his enemies and take full control of their actions.This allows one survivor to eliminate another survivor while being possessed by Charlie.When Charlie is in possession of a survivor, he will also have the option to perform a ""Final Kill"".
 

 

The main goal is to be able to finish the game and offer you a complete product with a lot of content since its release.
It is necessary to expand the project team to be able to finish the game in less time and at the same time be able to include better and more content.

<h1><span>Stretch Goals</span></h1>
<p>Together, we can obliterate the initial merged campaign goal and get every ""Count"" and ""Prince"" more rewards. </p>
<p>For every goal we pass:</p>
<p>Each ""Count"" (and ""Duke"") will get one of EVERY stretch goal prize unlocked by the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>Each ""Prince"" (and higher) will get 4 of EVERY stretch goal prize unlocked by the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>Note this is limited to one set of prizes for each backer, so ordering 2x ""Counts"" will NOT give you two of every card.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the Prizes already unlocked thanks to our other crowdfunding campaign. Anyone funding here on Indie GoGo at the relevant level instantly gets ALL these cards as a bonus:</strong></p>

<p>Currently we're midway through our Alpha stage, with most cards created and our standard multiplayer game mode fully working. We'll be heading into Closed Alpha on December 7th, so you won't have to wait long to start experiencing and influencing how the game will play when it goes public. Closed Beta will be around January.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5em;"">We’ve been waiting and waiting for a “proper” Digital Trading Card game to be made for a couple of years now; and whilst there are Digital Trading Card games out there, rarely are they truly strategic and deep, and we’ve found none have hit on all levels and made full use of this wonderful digital technology most of us have in our pockets. It felt like being hit in the face with a Kobold club when we realized the world was ready for one, and we are the guys to do it. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5em;"">We’re an independently owned and funded studio, with talented artists and genius coders, who are in love with both video games and card games.

<div class=""template asset"" style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/271/372/16681416008d1c74b4b7c2d0f1c79ed7_large.png?1353391280"" src="""" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;""/></div>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5em;"">Lore – On the world of Avarrach, cybernetic modifications were the norm, its citizens enhancing their bodies with nano technology. However, sleeping within their nanobot technology was a dangerous flaw: a backdoor which could rewrite any any nearby nanobot into a copy of itself. One day, centuries ago, a nanobot virus was unleashed upon the world: one that would take over the host’s body, killing it, then aggressively spread to each nearby nanobot. The world of Avarrach turned into a nightmare. Within three days, 90% of the world turned into unthinking husks, the human host dead, but animated by the nanobot technologies embedded in their body. The survivors, those without augmentations, fought as best they could, but soon were overwhelmed. The nanobots took over their bodies and they too joined the undead horde.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5em;"">The virus animated each body to seek out and feed on any living thing, and for years, the zombies went on a rampage, devouring all living things they could find, until eventually the planet was completely devoid of life. With nothing left to feed on, the undead stopped moving, sleeping, the virus waiting for new living to devour. There they laid for hundreds of years, unmoving. When the rifts opened to the Old World, the Sleepers of Ararrach slowly woke from their deep sleep, smelling new life to feed on.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5em;"">As only the Sleepers closest to the rifts have awoken, few understand the true danger. However, in time the whole planet will awaken, and every world will face an incredible threat.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5em;"">Mechanics - The Sleepers of Avarrach are relentless, and ultimately unstoppable. While a single zombie is of little threat, over time more and more zombies arrive, overwhelming the enemy. Killing a Sleeper of Avarrach is often only a temporary respite, as they are the best faction at using their graveyard, bringing many cards back from the dead, over and over until the enemy is overwhelmed. Furthermore, many of the Sleepers are infectious: when they kill an enemy character, that character gets turned into an undead, and the Sleepers gain control of it. To defeat the Sleepers, enemy players must manage keeping the undead under check, while simultaneously advancing their own plan swiftly enough to win before they are overwhelmed.</p>

Previous Successful Campaign Link
Indie GoGo Purpose
During our ridiculously successful crowdfunding campaign on that other popular site, we've received innumerable requests for Paypal payments, multi language support, and a way to bring friends in who missed the boat. This campaign will do just that.
We're now doing merged stretch goals, so you lucky Indie GoGo backers get to benefit from the previous pledges & prizes; and everyone (including backers from our other campaign) gets to unlock more Stretch Goal Prizes.
We're also wanting to implement as much multi language support as possible. Currently we have lined up: French, Japanese, Chinese and German.
If you're concerned this goal is too low to create a high calliber game, kindly note this is one part of our Merged Funding Campaign and take a look at what we've done so far; art, pledge and fan wise in just 30 days. :)

Why You Will Love Our Game


Free to Play – You could eventually acquire every card in-game by buying packets using earned currency, as long as you can keep up with our development team that is tasked with creating new ongoing content. This is the good free to play, no ""energy gates"" or ""exclusive to buying with real world cash"" cards.

""Merged Deck"" Mode - We're designing an optional, casual mode specifically for anyone who thinks Trading Card Games are all ""Pay to Win"", Eurogamers or Board Game Strategists; that want a completely even playing field each match. The overall design revolves around merging the decks of both players into one huge deck, so no matter what cards each player has collected, it will only come down to skill and luck of the draw. 

Fully Animated Decks - Every single card in Infinity Wars is animated; this is the true evolution of Trading Card Games to Digital.


Comprehensive Tutorial Quests - Gamers new to trading card games are shown through ""Beginner Quests"": how to play and craft a winning deck.

Simultaneous Gameplay - Each turn is taken at the same time allowing for near constant interaction and welcoming intriguing bluff & prediction tactics.

Remote Turn-Based Multiplayer – Play games with anyone in the world, from anywhere with internet access.

Hardcore Strategy - Most digital trading card games have oversimplified and gone all mainstream with their game mechanics. We've done the opposite and increased strategic depth by including positioning, yet allowing unlimited cards on field.

Weekly New Releases - New quests are created constantly providing new levels and brand new cards to unlock each and every week.

Comprehensive Ever Changing Single Player Campaign - We have an in depth Single Player Campaign, that will have side quests added to it each week. All cards unlockable without ever needing to play a human.

3D Transformable Battlefield - The default 3D Battlefield can be changed by playing Location cards which transform the field of play.
 
Stretch Goals
Together, we can obliterate the initial merged campaign goal and get every ""Count"" and ""Prince"" more rewards. 
For every goal we pass:
Each ""Count"" (and ""Duke"") will get one of EVERY stretch goal prize unlocked by the end of the campaign.
Each ""Prince"" (and higher) will get 4 of EVERY stretch goal prize unlocked by the end of the campaign.
Note this is limited to one set of prizes for each backer, so ordering 2x ""Counts"" will NOT give you two of every card.
Here's the Prizes already unlocked thanks to our other crowdfunding campaign. Anyone funding here on Indie GoGo at the relevant level instantly gets ALL these cards as a bonus:
 

650 backers

40k achieved 

 
 33k prize unlocked.

 
27k prize achieved

 
22k prize achieved, Hellmouth Location Card.

17k Prize Achieved

3 More Example Animated Cards



Currently we're midway through our Alpha stage, with most cards created and our standard multiplayer game mode fully working. We'll be heading into Closed Alpha on December 7th, so you won't have to wait long to start experiencing and influencing how the game will play when it goes public. Closed Beta will be around January.
Rest assured there's no chance the game won't make it to release as we have more than enough private funds to cover basic production; your pledges will allow us to bring extra features and get the game launched in as many countries as possible.
Why We Want To Do This
We’ve been waiting and waiting for a “proper” Digital Trading Card game to be made for a couple of years now; and whilst there are Digital Trading Card games out there, rarely are they truly strategic and deep, and we’ve found none have hit on all levels and made full use of this wonderful digital technology most of us have in our pockets. It felt like being hit in the face with a Kobold club when we realized the world was ready for one, and we are the guys to do it. 
We’re an independently owned and funded studio, with talented artists and genius coders, who are in love with both video games and card games. Your pledges allow us to create an even better game than we would without it, and we get to thank you for causing that with exclusive rewards.
The First Five Factions
 
The Sleepers of Avarrach

Lore – On the world of Avarrach, cybernetic modifications were the norm, its citizens enhancing their bodies with nano technology. However, sleeping within their nanobot technology was a dangerous flaw: a backdoor which could rewrite any any nearby nanobot into a copy of itself. One day, centuries ago, a nanobot virus was unleashed upon the world: one that would take over the host’s body, killing it, then aggressively spread to each nearby nanobot. The world of Avarrach turned into a nightmare. Within three days, 90% of the world turned into unthinking husks, the human host dead, but animated by the nanobot technologies embedded in their body. The survivors, those without augmentations, fought as best they could, but soon were overwhelmed. The nanobots took over their bodies and they too joined the undead horde.
The virus animated each body to seek out and feed on any living thing, and for years, the zombies went on a rampage, devouring all living things they could find, until eventually the planet was completely devoid of life. With nothing left to feed on, the undead stopped moving, sleeping, the virus waiting for new living to devour. There they laid for hundreds of years, unmoving. When the rifts opened to the Old World, the Sleepers of Ararrach slowly woke from their deep sleep, smelling new life to feed on.
As only the Sleepers closest to the rifts have awoken, few understand the true danger. However, in time the whole planet will awaken, and every world will face an incredible threat.
Mechanics - The Sleepers of Avarrach are relentless, and ultimately unstoppable. While a single zombie is of little threat, over time more and more zombies arrive, overwhelming the enemy. Killing a Sleeper of Avarrach is often only a temporary respite, as they are the best faction at using their graveyard, bringing many cards back from the dead, over and over until the enemy is overwhelmed. Furthermore, many of the Sleepers are infectious: when they kill an enemy character, that character gets turned into an undead, and the Sleepers gain control of it. To defeat the Sleepers, enemy players must manage keeping the undead under check, while simultaneously advancing their own plan swiftly enough to win before they are overwhelmed.
The Cult of Verore

Lore - The Cult of Verore delves deep into black magic, constantly perfecting their spells of death. It was they who opened the Hellmouth, unleashing the demons into Reish and covering their world in darkness. A corrupted Aleta, the leader of the Verore, cares little. 
Mechanics - The Cult focuses on character removal abilities, they are the masters of making things die. Sitting from the support zone, their unlimited character - the Verore Death Watchers - become stronger with each enemy that goes to the grave, until they are able to destroy the opposing player from the power they fed off. However, if their kill spells are successfully dodged by being moved into the support zone by a skilled player, the Verore can find themselves overwhelmed by their enemies. 
Genesis Industries 

Lore - Genesis Industries seeks to remodel the world with their highly advanced, hyper efficient technologies. Everything and anything can be improved to be bigger, faster, stronger. Orion, the leader of Genesis Industries, is a visionary who is on a mission to ensure the world is able to keep up with the accelerating demands of civilization, a mission in which nature’s time has past, and anybody who stands in the way must be destroyed. 
 Mechanics - Genesis Industries cards are the masters of building up. With time and an influx of resources, the Industry can build up huge, overpowering characters that dominate the battlefield. Furthermore, they are the masters of reusing their resources, able to recur cards from their graveyard to continue their fighting effort. A Genesis Industries player must be find a fine line between power and greed however, as putting all their eggs in one basket with a single powerful character can be disastrous if they misread their opponent. 
The Flame Dawn 

Lore - The Flame Dawn is an organized, aggressive army. Their leader, Aberion, is said to be invincible in battle, and nobody has been able to prove it wrong. He leads an aggressive campaign to expand the borders of the Flame Dawn, to forge a great empire that will last for ages. When the rifts opened, The Flame Dawn immediately entered and began aggressively claiming territory under their flag. 
 Mechanics - Flame Dawn cards are very aggressive, aiming to win the game quickly with a swarm of characters before other, lumbering strategies can come fully online, or at least deal so much damage in the early turns of the game that the enemy is always on the back foot. The cost for their speed, however, is a lack of staying power, as their removal abilities are all temporary, providing a window for victory that they must quickly seize. 
The Warpath

Lore - The Warpath is not so much a faction as a collective understanding by the beasts of the Old World that they must fight back against the intruders. Named not by themselves, but by the invaders from the other dimensions upon seeing the horror of hundreds of massive beasts bearing down on them with killing intent, “being caught on the warpath” is a horror story passed between all the would-be conquerors of the Old World. 
Mechanics - Like the beasts of The Warpath, the cards of The Warpath are usually simple, but strong. There are no small beasts. Each beast is a large killer, often able to take on many characters from other factions in direct combat before dying.

<p>We thank you. Kiitos.</p></div>","Arenum is a free fantasy gladiator team management game. What this basically means is that you control a team of gladiators, or as they are called in-game, Combatants. You hire randomly generated gladiators from 30 different races with their own unique abilities and traits and build your dream team. When the team is set, you'll face other teams and fight against them in tactical turn-based combat.
Here's a full list of features.

Seven different tournaments (Slaves' League, Warriors' League, Heroes' League, Supreme League, Legendary League, The Continental Cup, The Grand Skirmish)
Randomly created gladiators; more than a hundred million possibilities!
Customize your gladiators by buying them equipment, leveling them up, enchanting their items, changing their wages, training them by hiring masters and in many other ways!
Gladiators will also earn experience in different combat abilities such as crossbows, light armor, swords and clubs.
The presence of magic is strong! Learn magic with your gladiator and choose from fourteen different spells.
Fight against fifty teams controlled by AI. They'll also striving to win their way to the top of Legendary League!
Tactical turn-based combat with thousands of different possible tactics!
A nice retro feeling in the game; pixelated graphics, 8-bit sound effects and music!
A multiplayer mode! Take up your team against randomly chosen teams of your level across the world and try to reach the top of the online team rankings!
The Grand Skirmish tournament will pit you against foreign teams of the fantasy world every four in-game years. You'll see them using different technology and items. There might be even foreign races that you are not used to!
A versatile, interesting gameplay that will last for at least fifty hours!
Many events, for example, wars and slave rebellions! Events will have impact on the arena and your gladiators.
You can research new technology! There's 25 items you can discover when researching.
Much, much more!

More features will be included in the game depending on how much we'll manage to raise.
 
Download Arenum Demo!
You can download the Arenum demo version and see if the game is worth donating to. Remember: this demo is a very early alpha version of the game. Most of the features are not in the game and the features implemented are not finished. There might be bugs and errors as well.

If we can reach certain goals, the following features will be added into the game.
$100: Ten more traits!
$250: We will hire a professional to make our website instead of writing it on our own.
$400: We will port the game to Android.
$500: Five mythology-based races!
$1000: Gladiator-specific religions with distinct advantages and disadvantages!
$2000: Five more races, twenty more traits, more sprites for every race making your gladiators more unique, more events!
$5000: Something very cool.
 

 
Here's a couple of good reasons:



We need to pay for the game server.
We need some devices to study other platforms and to make porting the game to iOS, Android and Mac OS X a possibility.
We'd like to pay for my musician and other co-workers.
We are mostly students, so providing us money would make this project progress much faster.

<h3>What is Galactic War ?</h3>
<p>Galactic War will be a meta-game where you battle for a single faction, for the control of the galaxy.</p>
<p>You will have to protect planet in 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, add shields/defense weapons to them, and finally win the Infinite War.</p>
<p>A battle for a planet can be anything FAF can do :</p>
<p>- A simple 1v1 or team game.<br/>- A survival against AI or a human controlling the streams.<br/>- A king of the hill or civilian defense game.<br/>- A game with funny rules.</p>

My name is Hillary Welch Kleck and in the video is my daughter, Madilyn. Madilyn was diagnosed with bilateral anophthalmia in 2005. Since then, I've continuously struggled to find toys and games that she can play with independently. It didn't take me long to figure out that not all toys are created equal! </p>
<p>Many toys rely on the user to get instructions from visual aspects of the toy like a screen or lights. These toys don't relay the information verbally or tactually for effective use by a blind child. Few toys incorporate Braille, but many can still be adapted at home or school. However, some toys have designs that are accessible with little or no adaptations needed. These are toys that families like mine search for far and wide, but aren't always easy to find. It's hard to tell whether a toy is accessible based on how it looks in a box or even its description online.</p>
<p>So this year, I've taken the time to search and review tons of toys and games that many visually impaired children would enjoy opening on Christmas morning, or anytime of the year! I'm putting together a publication both in print and online called<strong> ALL PLAY Accessible Toy Guide for Children with Visual Impairments</strong>. The guide will be comprised of lists, details and pictures of all the best accessible toys for families to easily search out the ones best to fit their kid's wish lists, providing for a less-stress holiday! By promoting accessible toys we are one step closer to a more accessible world for children of all sight levels. So consider giving today!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Whatever amount you choose, you'll take pride in knowing that you're promoting equal socialization, education, and a fun childhood for visually impaired children. The more we raise, the more families we reach with the guide through their schools, communitites and organizations. </p>
<p>Like we said, not all toys are created equal. By insisting on accessibility at an early age through learning and play, visually impaired children have the opportunity to share in the community and at school by feeling included instead of left out because they aren't able to participate.

It plays out in the form of a puzzle and points are awarded for creating correct questions or sentences, not words like in Scrabble. This has been called the evolution of Scrabble. It is totally fun and educational. The idea of color-coding the words in order to learn the rules of the English language a great new concept!</p>
<p>Marcelo Montecinos was born in Santiago, Chile and moved to Toronto, Canada at the age of 9. He didn't know a word of English and was bullied and tormented until he learned the English language. His teacher introduced the new immigrants to Scrabble. He used to take the dictionary home with him in order to learn new words so that he could win at playing the game. Fast forward 30 years and he became a teacher of English as a second language. Since the English language only has 4 or 5 options to the verb (not like French or Spanish which have 18), he realized that he could put these options on a rectangular, wooden stick. He did, and the original Phrazzle Me was born. He got it protected and began selling it worldwide via <a href=""http://www.phrazzleme.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.phrazzleme.com</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of color-coding the words came to him in a dream at about three o'clock in the morning. He was flabbergasted! The game now sells in 38 countries and has been featured in newspapers and TV, as well as winning two innovation awards. The idea of being able to help teachers teach the language in a fun, competitive manner is very exciting. Helping students learn the language while enjoying themselves is also fantastic.</p>
<p>Phrazzle Me has received two awards but has never gotten any financial help from any Government or individuals. This has limited its growth. It has had to have controlled growth in order to finance the games and cannot  sell at retail stores yet due to lack of funds.</p>
<p>It's inventor is looking to raise $10,000-100,000 in order to go to China and take control of the production of the games. He plans on using the funds to make an infomercial there. He is sure he can sell 1,000,000 games within a year. Since the games are made there, they can be sold for very cheap and thereby, make it a more-reachable product for the world. At that point, It could also begin selling them via retailers and be marketed as a new board game <strong>for all</strong>...not just as an English-learning tool/game. Phrazzle Me has the potential to outsell Srabble, within a few years. The funds will also be used for making it an App and on playing the game live online. <strong>20% of all sales will go towards donating games to poor schools worldwide</strong> (games have already been donated in Chile, China and El Salvador).</p>
<p>Please help by donating and by spreading the word about this incredible game. Let's combine education with gaming and teach English to the world.</p>

<p>Isbarah is a hardcore game mixed between
platformer and shoot them up. You will fight against huge and powerful boss and only against them: each combat is a duel. You will have to keep your head and think really fast to stay alive and victorious.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The game takes place in a mysterious
world where human imagination lives. You will deal with human-imagined
creatures but also against non-imagined creatures called Designless.</p>

<p><u><b>Challenging
Gameplay</b></u></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You are alone against powerful entities. No one to help you, and you need
to think fast, use your power wisely and be cool. Survival is hard,
but with big score comes great rewards.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u><b>Platformer Vs Shoot them up</b></u></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
You're moving like in a platformer. Your enemies move freely like in a shoot them up. They create rains of bullets to kill
you. With your physical abilities and movement capacities it's gonna be hell to
survive. But you have your powers...</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<u><b>3 powers :</b></u></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	Control time : You can use slow motion to be more accurate and look around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Control speed  : You can dash to extract yourself from
	delicate positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Control the environment : You can create platforms to
	use it or make a shield.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Duels</b></u>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Every combat is intense. No small fries, only duel against powerful and merciless boss.</p>
<p><u><b>2D Painting</b></u></p>
<p>Yeah, we love beautiful 2D painting. So we put that in the game !</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">That's why we wanted to create a game with an original, yet simple, gameplay.</span></p>
<p>The result is a game in which every player can grow his own way of moving and surpass himself over and over again. We like creating situations that appear unsolvable at first but that can be achieved with training and skills.</p>
<p>We are fond of 2D painting, and we wanted to bring the player a piece of this art. This goes beyond the visual aspects of the game, as all the gameplay is also impacted.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We now have all the elements we need to bring you guys a fun and challenging game, with beautiful 2D graphics, we just need your help to increase the scope of the game and polish it.</span></p>

Isbarah is a hardcore game mixed between
platformer and shoot them up. You will fight against huge and powerful boss and only against them: each combat is a duel. You will have to keep your head and think really fast to stay alive and victorious.


The game takes place in a mysterious
world where human imagination lives. You will deal with human-imagined
creatures but also against non-imagined creatures called Designless.

                  
Abadon: designed creature

Your father is the god of this world,
but this world keeps expanding and he needs you to maintain
his supremacy. 



But any totalitarian regime, by human or
god, is not only white and black...








Challenging
Gameplay


You are alone against powerful entities. No one to help you, and you need
to think fast, use your power wisely and be cool. Survival is hard,
but with big score comes great rewards.


Platformer Vs Shoot them up



You're moving like in a platformer. Your enemies move freely like in a shoot them up. They create rains of bullets to kill
you. With your physical abilities and movement capacities it's gonna be hell to
survive. But you have your powers...



3 powers :





	Control time : You can use slow motion to be more accurate and look around.



	Control speed  : You can dash to extract yourself from
	delicate positions.



	Control the environment : You can create platforms to
	use it or make a shield.





Duels




Every combat is intense. No small fries, only duel against powerful and merciless boss.
2D Painting
Yeah, we love beautiful 2D painting. So we put that in the game !




Gameplay Diary
abilities : 




Do
you like Touhou
Project
? Super Meat Boy ? Shadows of Colossus ? 

We
do.
That's why we wanted to create a game with an original, yet simple, gameplay.
The result is a game in which every player can grow his own way of moving and surpass himself over and over again. We like creating situations that appear unsolvable at first but that can be achieved with training and skills.
We are fond of 2D painting, and we wanted to bring the player a piece of this art. This goes beyond the visual aspects of the game, as all the gameplay is also impacted.
We now have all the elements we need to bring you guys a fun and challenging game, with beautiful 2D graphics, we just need your help to increase the scope of the game and polish it.








We are currently in development. We have enough money to do the rough version of 5 chapters of Isbarah. This graph will show our progress: 



Luc is working on the design of chapter 5 boss.
Lorène is working on chapter 5 boss and chapter 3 levels
Manouk is making a first set of animations for Chapter 5 boss.
Aurélien is integrating Chapter 2.
















Right now, we don't have enough resources to polish and extend the game we already have. 

For instance, the editor is a very important functionality for us but it's
a complex task and we need time to do it. 

So
far, we funded everything by ourselves but we need you to make the game
greater (for the greater good).












We
have three needs :




Finish and polish the game : QA, animated scenes, improve animations and other FX.


Sound design : we need to outsource this part because we can't do good stuff by ourselves.

















Lorène
: 2D graphics


Gael
: Programming


Manouk

Laurent

With 5 chapters we don't have time to show each cool stuff and battle we can make. With time we become more skilled and we would love to add two more chapters with GIANT HUGE BADASS BOSS.

Lv 1 : 44.000 euros 
If we manage to rise 44.000 € we make chapter 6.Chapters are composed of 3 epic battles with their own unique level. Chap 6 would contain mythological beasts. 

            Lv 2 : 56.000 euros

If we manage to rise 56.000 € we make chapter 7.Chapters are composed of 3 epic battles with their own unique level. Chap 7 would contain very specific platformer mechanics, together with the most powerful boss. Must be insane to fight against them.

Lv 3 : 102.000 euros

If we manage to raise 102.000 € we will make three more chapters. Not with the most powerful boss (see above), but with a lot of secrets about the universe of Isbarah.

<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;""><b>● Max-Power</b><br/>As long as your energy is over 80%, Max can maximize the power of the currently equipped  weapon. If you play carefully and avoid being hit, you can defeat your enemies more easily.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444057821/f8dcvkq9iflfbuwjkqpt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;""><b>● Energy Dash</b><br/>You can activate the Energy Dash mechanism when jumping. This allows you to dash from one point to the other, damaging the enemies that stand in your way. This skill consumes your energy, use it carefully! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444057850/lmmgq8pdzyydcoqzjro3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;"">These two skills are unique to Max and they offer more choices during gameplay. You can play it safe, avoiding damage and preventing your energy from dropping below 80% in order to attack your enemies at full shooting power, or you can try to clear the level faster, neglecting your energy and using average shots.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Combat profiles</b></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In Miracle-M you will be able to customize Max’s status through experience points obtained during gameplay. Using these points, you can progressively improve your speed, jumps, damage resistance and energy consumption.</p>
<p>Up to two combat profiles can be configured and easily swapped while playing, enabling you to be ready to face whatever enemies come your way. For example, you can set up a profile that favors speed and one that reduces the damage received during combat. Fine-tuning Max’s performance is in your hands!</p>

<p><b>The development lab</b></p>
<p>In Miracle-M, there are six power gems that have been stolen by the enemy. Unlike Mega-Man games where you obtain the boss’s power after defeating them, in Miracle-M you will recover one of the gems and it will give you points of power that can be used to upgrade your weapons. Max can combine the power of two gems at the same time, and thus the number of shooting patterns is higher than the number of bosses defeated during gameplay.</p>
<p>As Max is an android operating through complex programming algorithms, his weapons are no different. Miracle-M will feature a laboratory where new shooting patterns can be experimented on and developed using and allocating the gems’ points of power.</p>
<p>The firing patters can be shared online and rated by the community. Early-access players can experiment on and discover new weapons before everyone else! And there’s more, we have decided to double the number of points of power given to the people contributing to the campaign, allowing them to develop the initial weapons of the community.</p>

Miracle-M is a new side-scrolling action game that takes the best aspects of the 16-bit era classics, and infuses them with modern tech and new mechanics!
We started this project around April 2013, but development was halted in the same year. One reason was perhaps the appearance of a spiritual successor of Mega Man on Kickstarter. After two years we decided to continue the project.
Below are some images of our designs back in 2013. Our goal today is higher and we want to offer a game with better quality, which will translate into an overall improvement of the final product.



The Hero: Miracle MaxMax’s main skills:
● Max-PowerAs long as your energy is over 80%, Max can maximize the power of the currently equipped  weapon. If you play carefully and avoid being hit, you can defeat your enemies more easily.

● Energy DashYou can activate the Energy Dash mechanism when jumping. This allows you to dash from one point to the other, damaging the enemies that stand in your way. This skill consumes your energy, use it carefully! 

These two skills are unique to Max and they offer more choices during gameplay. You can play it safe, avoiding damage and preventing your energy from dropping below 80% in order to attack your enemies at full shooting power, or you can try to clear the level faster, neglecting your energy and using average shots.

Combat profiles
In Miracle-M you will be able to customize Max’s status through experience points obtained during gameplay. Using these points, you can progressively improve your speed, jumps, damage resistance and energy consumption.
Up to two combat profiles can be configured and easily swapped while playing, enabling you to be ready to face whatever enemies come your way. For example, you can set up a profile that favors speed and one that reduces the damage received during combat. Fine-tuning Max’s performance is in your hands!

The development lab
In Miracle-M, there are six power gems that have been stolen by the enemy. Unlike Mega-Man games where you obtain the boss’s power after defeating them, in Miracle-M you will recover one of the gems and it will give you points of power that can be used to upgrade your weapons. Max can combine the power of two gems at the same time, and thus the number of shooting patterns is higher than the number of bosses defeated during gameplay.
As Max is an android operating through complex programming algorithms, his weapons are no different. Miracle-M will feature a laboratory where new shooting patterns can be experimented on and developed using and allocating the gems’ points of power.
The firing patters can be shared online and rated by the community. Early-access players can experiment on and discover new weapons before everyone else! And there’s more, we have decided to double the number of points of power given to the people contributing to the campaign, allowing them to develop the initial weapons of the community.





Our story
unfolds in a planet that has enjoyed centuries of peace and harmony, sustained
by gems that stand as power source for this world and maintain its
stability.
Miracle-M
begins when this planet is invaded by a spaceship fleet set to obtain the power
gems. The
presence of these ships triggers the planet’s defense system. One of the
defense weapons is Max, a humanoid guardian robot activated to ward off the
invasion.
Max is our
hero and his mission is to recover the gems stolen by six invading beasts led
by a mysterious woman. Who is this intriguing woman and what are her plans for the gems? We are going to unravel this mystery when Max faces this enigmatic woman.

We are planning to include some animated sequences in the game's storyline if we reach specific stretch goals. Our team is formed by talented people in the animation field and we want to achieve what Capcom did in previous Mega Man games using some cool animation scenes in the game.


Developing video games is expensive and time-consuming. We showed this project to a couple of publishers, but we had no luck. Their response was that there is no interest in a platform game despite the fact that we are sure this project will be a success!
We decided to go with Indiegogo because it provides us a unique opportunity to interface directly with our fans and make a game where the end user can share their expectations.
We know that the final game is going to be great. We believe that we have the required skills and attitude to make a successful game. We just need to be heard by all fans of Mega Man in order to reach our goals and get the funding needed for this project. Please support us and be part of the beginning of this new saga. We need you!

The base value requested in this campaign accounts for the entire game experience as we have envisioned it. However, we have so many great ideas that the more we are able to raise, the greater the chance to make those ideas come true.
Our stretch goals will mainly focus on improving the game, expanding its availability to other platforms and adding some features that will not cause delays in the project.
Miracle-M is being developed for PC, and will be made available through Steam. Other platforms, including home consoles, are a high priority, but only if we can afford them via stretch goals. Should we reach those goals, when this campaign is over we'll be sending out a survey to contributors who pledge for a digital copy, through which you will be allowed to choose which version of the game you would like to receive.

We’re not just going to show you some pretty pictures and expect that you’ll back our project. We're offering some great rewards for Miracle-M contributors that you won't find anywhere else!
Many rewards have multiple items included, so please use the Reward Matrix at the end of this section as a reference. The product images do not represent the final products.











The matrix bellow lists all the rewards that are included for pledging your support for Miracle-M. Rewards listed in red have limited availability, so if there is a reward you don't want to miss out on, pledge early!






Even if you can’t donate, help us spread the word about the crowdfunding campaign! Indiegogo provides some easy-sharing tools for you to do so! 
The more the word spreads about the campaign, the more likely it is that we will reach our crowdfunding goal!
A huge thanks to all the awesome people pledging to the crowdfunding, spreading the word and supporting us. You’re as much part of this project as we are. We wouldn’t be here without you.
The road ahead is long, but with your help we can do it. Let’s make it happen!

We have the man power to give it a shot though.  </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As for my business plan, there will be a subscription model setup on the site that anyone who hits the $15 tier or higher will be put into (even if more stuff is added that isn't listed there currently).  I have a few ideas of subscriber interaction, like on streaming nights picking a few subscribers at random to team up with and we all can hop on Skype and the stream will be all of us playing, plus our voices.  I could easily do one PS4 night and one XB1 night with that setup.  It would be even more exciting if we could get some industry personalities to join us as well.  Other means of keeping the site sustainable are advertising, which sucks - but required - and just a simple ol' donate button.  Also if we go in a video-heavy direction we will also try to monetize that with YouTube, which - again - sorry for the ads. </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I also have some ideas in terms of reviews, or mini reviews, looking at games and what their worth is.  Something like breaking down all of the PS4/XB1 launch games and now that they are starting to go on sale what price each becomes worth it (if at all... some games, unfortunately, just aren't worth your time, let alone your money). </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The ideas are flowing. The funding is picking up.  The site is coming together.  The staff is coming together.  Things are very positive over here right now.  And if you haven't contributed yet - please do! Every cent will help make the site better.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Also, if you want to see part two of that interview with boogie, go here:  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSKupITM0ZE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSKupITM0ZE</a></span><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 38px;"">Major update #1</span><br/></p><p>The funding got off to a wonderful start and has slowed down which is usual for anything not made by Inafune, Shafer, or that Scrubs guy.  The hard part has officially begun, which is making the sell to people who have no background info on me, the people who will be helping me, or why this is a worthwhile project.  I also need a stroke of luck... someone with a huge twitter following to tweet about it.  A random article about it that garners a ton of interest.  It's better to be lucky than good, they say.  I would prefer to be both.</p><p>What I can say is that I have a few ideas to get funding moving (though I do expect it to mostly be flatlined other than a few bumps, which are hopefully large).  Beyond that, however, I've gotten more people willing to help than I ever imagined. This will bring down the costs quite a bit.  I can't change the goal after having started this IGG, but I do feel confident that I'm already pretty close to having enough money to launch the site with a much larger staff than I expected. I believe the legitimacy of the site will happen quicker because of this and normal avenues of funding (advertising, mostly) will kick in sooner than I expected. As I've stated many times, I'm not pocketing a dime of this IGG. It's all going into the site. </p><p>The main reason to hit the goal at this point are for purity reasons.  The less we have to rely on advertising the better.  Also, IGG pockets a much larger % of the funding for projects that don't hit the goal.  I like Indiegogo, but I'd much rather that money go into the site.</p><p>Please share this page with as many people as you know.  Tweet it at your favorite YouTubers or other independent gaming voices.  If you are fourth cousins with Ashton Kutcher ask him for a twitter favor. I need you guys for this to work. </p><p>All in all it's been a spectacular start. I knew the flatline was coming (as it does on all crowd-funding) and now it's time to find a way to push through that.  I will soon have some announcements about uses of the money already earned as construction will begin earlier than I expected.  Other than the worst stomach flu of my life which i just recovered from... these are some extremely exciting times.  </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>___________________</h2><h2>The problem:</h2><p>A major failing of the gaming media is that they are beholden to the companies they cover. Whether they fear being blacklisted and not receiving review copies, or that the journalist in question is using their platform as a springboard to get a job in the industry proper, there often seems to be a conflict of interest: review scores that are far too high, repeating press releases as if they are news, and dismissing facts completely because they go against the narrative they are trying to build...  This is a problem and it seems like gamers have far less trust in these sites because of it.</p><p>The problem is that a website needs to play ball with publishers to have any chance of success. If you don't get your review up when the embargo is lifted, you will receive far fewer clicks than you would otherwise. If you are critical of a company and they blacklist you so that you no longer get press releases, early screens or videos, or other such materials, it puts you behind your competitors. Life is a thousand times harder for small sites or blacklisted sites because they don't get the access of the bigger sites who have this symbiotic relationship with developers.</p><p>Dodd Scientifics will not be about any of that.</p><h2>My idea:</h2><p>The site I want to create will be strictly independent. There are certain things we will go along with that are the industry standard, like embargoes and NDA's, but we will not shy away from reporting a story because it may damage our relationship with a publisher. Nor will we fail to give a game a review score we think it deserves because it will anger the publisher, the fanboys, and lessen our chance of being on Metacritic. If we are blacklisted, we will tell you.  If there are gaming companies who refuse to give us any access we will write stories about that.  This whole underbelly of the industry needs to be exposed and eradicated if ""games journalism"" is to survive.  And as an active member at NeoGAF, Reddit, and other popular forums, I'm well aware that the bigger gaming sites are not as invaluable as they may think they are. They (and I) need you a lot more than you need them.</p><p>I want to do everything that a gaming website shouldn't. This is an approach that is currently believed to be unsustainable.  I'm not arguing that it isn't.  What I'm arguing is that irrespective of this, it needs to exist, and it currently does not.  There are some wonderful independent voices in our community but not a central hub where you can reliably hear from an outsider's perspective.  I've been referred to as ""industry insider Pete Dodd"" when websites publish my tweets as stories, but I want to be the opposite. I don't want to be a part of the industry, I want to look at it from the view of an outsider. Or, as you may know them as... consumers.</p><p>I would also like to use the website as a platform for talented people in need of exposure. This could range from an indie developer using the site as developer diary to things like gaming related artists, podcasts, comics, and of course writers. In addition, whenever we pull a news story that has been posted elsewhere we will go above and beyond to credit the source.  We won't just say ""Source: Neogaf"" with a link.  We would mention the user by name and even link to that person's personal site if it is in their bio. Likewise if it's pulled from another site we will of course link to the original article but will also name the writer as the source. Sources should be given more credit than they currently are. We plan to do our best to contribute to that.</p><h3>Who am I?</h3><p>My name is Pete Dodd and I am a 36 year old married man with a wonderful wife and no kids (yet?). I've been a freelance writer since the mid-nineties.  I've written for the New Haven Advocate, a newspaper that had a readership of 75k at the time.  I've ghostwritten a psychiatric manual for a therapist located in Vermont (where I lived for several years).  I was offered a position as a freelancer at EGM in the early 00's but gave up on the idea when they moved from Chicago to San Francisco.  I've been a paid blogger on several sites, including being featured on Squidoo.  I also played a significant role in the <a href=""http://www.ps4nodrm.com/press-coverage.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.ps4nodrm.com/press-coverage.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">#PS4NoDRM</a> campaign last year.</p><p>Outside of writing, I worked in the mental health field for fifteen years.  I worked primarily with adults with autism, teaching them living skills to be more independent.  I also worked with kids who had been through traumatic situations.  It was very rewarding work that I am happy that I did. </p><p>My personal preferences in games skew towards the Playstation.  I want to be clear about that. I can and will be objective but I think it's important to know what a person's preferences are.  If I get the chance to add more staff, one thing I will really search for is getting people with other preferences so the site can give a wider set of opinions (when opinions are warranted).</p><p>And last but certainly not least (ok, maybe least), I was one of the Gamers of the Year in 2013 as selected by Kotaku. <a href=""http://kotaku.com/the-video-gamers-of-the-year-1486081739"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://kotaku.com/the-video-gamers-of-the-year-1486081739"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BOOM!</a></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I need to get this going:</h3><p>As I've considered what I want to do with the site over the last few months, I've come to the conclusion that it can be many things and those things, unfortunately, cost money. First off, the site is happening, no matter what.  I need $8,500 to make this site exist for one year without it making me a penny through advertising.  I don't expect to hit this. With $5000 I believe I can sustain it with the help of advertising and other revenue.   Here's how the pricing breaks down over the course of a year. </p><h4>The essentials:</h4><p>Website design -  Donated</p><p>Website/podcast hosting - $1000</p><p>Games and gaming related items: $1000</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Rent:  ($375 x 12) = $4500</span><br/></p><p>Utilities ($100 x 12) = $1200</p><p>Indiegogo's cut (If I reach the goal - it more than doubles in percentage if I don't.) = $340</p><p>These are all ballpark figures that can and will move depending on the funding.  The chances of getting of getting exactly $8250 are nearly zero.  This is just an outline of how I would use the money. It can be divided or multiplied depending on what the final numbers end up being.  I don't plan on pocketing a cent from this campaign, every single penny will go into building it and getting other people on board to help me build it. If I am going to profit (and obviously, yes, someday I would like to make money) it will be down the line when it is successful for being different and important to the gaming community.  </p><h4><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">What could be added?</span></h4><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Advertising </span><br/></p><h4><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What if I don't hit my goal?</span></h4><p>I start subtracting from each category (other than hosting, that number is locked). I can compromise on design.  I can get fewer games.  I can find other avenues to pay for rent and utilities.  This would mean taking on at least a part time job, if not a full time one. The number of times the site is updated daily would of course be impacted by this.  That said, this is a passion and not a money making scheme, so I will use every penny to achieve my goals the best I can.  I feel as though I have a solid track record behind me to give confidence in this.  Over 600 posts on my Doddscientifics blog, 31,000 tweets, and 6500 posts on GAF point to an obsessive who can't stop writing about videogames.</p><p><font color=""#000000"" size=""5""><span style=""letter-spacing: 1.440000057220459px; line-height: 30px;""><b><br/></b></span></font></p><p><font color=""#000000"" size=""5""><span style=""letter-spacing: 1.440000057220459px; line-height: 30px;""><b>Site details:</b></span></font></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">General news stories will be presented with 2 or 3 sections, depending on how much we know.</span><br/></p><p><b>Facts-----&gt;Conjecture----&gt;Rumors</b></p><p>So let's say that Respawn announces that a day one patch will change the player count from the announced 6v6 to 8v8.  The news will be presented as objectively as possible under the Facts section.</p><p>In the Conjecture section I would say something like ""Six versus Six never felt empty in the beta but eight versus eight will definitely add to the chaos.  There were some framerate dips in the Xbox One beta so we will be keeping a close eye on how smoothly things go with the higher player count.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">And, if there is a rumor that is known to us that we believe to be credible (two sources is my personal rule) we will add that.  Example: ""This may not be the end of expanding the player count for Titanfall, sources close to the game say they hope to increase the player count further by the time the first DLC pack hits.""</span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">None of that is true by the way. It's just an example. The benefits of this three-tier news reporting is that if all you want is the news, you start at the top and read the facts and then you click off the page.  If you want to know what we think, you keep reading.  If you want to hear rumors, you keep reading beyond that.  I don't want to force an opinion down anyone's throat with news, so I believe compartmentalizing it like this is the best way to include everything without crossing boundaries.</span><br/></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Reviews.</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">  One to five stars.  No half stars.  Reviews are genre based.  Reviews will go up when they are ready - number of clicks be damned.</span><br/></p><p>Five represents the pinnacle of the genre and will likely pull in non-fans.</p><p>Four equals a strong game that fans of the genre will enjoy greatly.</p><p>Three equals an average game in the genre.</p><p>Two means super-fans of the genre may be able to eke out some fun, but there are too many issues for most gamers.</p><p>One equals no redeeming qualities.</p><p>Why genre based? Because some people like certain genres more than others.  A three for a  turn-based strategy game may mean more than a four for a first-person shooter to a certain person.  This keeps review scores comparing apples to apples instead of apples to oranges.</p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Editorials</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> - Free form.  It must be thought provoking and expressed in an intelligent way. That's the only rule here.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Videos and Streaming </b>-  I have a capture card and a very nice camera already, so videos are definitely something I plan on doing. I also stream quite a bit already.  My plan with the site is to have set nights where I stream games - hopefully showing off new games that up-and-coming developers want to get noticed.  Eventually, if audience participation gets going (and I know first hand this is *very* difficult to achieve), the streaming nights will be voted on in advance as to what I play.  </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Forums:</b> A private forum for supporters. A public forum will be opened as well.  </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Interviews</b> - I am interested in digging deeper than the usual interview. I believe this will keep most major publishers/developers away from me as it is out of PR's comfort zone. I'm not looking to be ""gotcha"" in interviews, but I do want to know more than reguritated fact sheets about the games.  I want to know why someone creates games.  I want to know how they feel when they have an idea and play it pre-alpha for the first time and how that feels.  I believe most of the people who would read a site like this are interested in this process also.  How hard is crunch?  Is it worth it? What does it do to your personal life? What effect does money have? What change do you regret the most?  I want to dig deep.  Will I be allowed to?  Probably not.  I don't care, I'm going to try.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Comments</b> - Moderately moderated, likely through community voting. This seems to fly in the face of everything else I'm trying to do with this site but there's a very good reason for it.  Most comments are useless trolling.  Those will be erased.  If you have something interesting to say, even if it disputes every single point we put forth, your comment would not be moderated. But the general rule of the internet is ""don't read the comments"".  I agree with that rule.  I will either moderate them heavily or turn them off.  Petty console war squabbles after every story have no point. I know they can be addictive and keep users on your site longer, which would increase the amount of revenue I make from advertising but, again, I don't care. I'm creating the unsustainable website.  </span><br/></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A platform for talented people</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> -  I plan on giving links to podcasts I love, youtube videos I love, artists I think are talented, comics I think are funny, and blogs I find interesting.  If people want to help with the site, be it news or reviews or editorials, there is a high bar for entry as I cringe at writing worse than my own (ok, so maybe the bar isn't very high).  I do want to be a platform for people to share their work with the world though. If you have talent, I am interested.  It's that simple.</span><br/></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Advertising</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> -  Yep. Google adsense.  Hopefully not to the point of being tacky.  I recommend using the adblock add-on that Chrome (and I assume other browsers) has. I hate looking at ads. I will probably use it on my own site. I won't blame anyone else who does the same. Again, unsustainable, but... enjoyable? That's the hope.</span><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>Reward Tiers &lt;----Full description here because of lack of character space in perk list</h3><p>This campaign is not about rewards. I am doing this solo and it's just not feasible for me to create a bunch of trinkets and whatnot.  If you believe in the idea and think I can pull it off, I would love a donation. If you want more, check out what's below, but it's not all that impressive.  Everything listed here is available at the $15 tier and higher and is a lifetime subscription.  A yearly subscription will be available when the site launches.  </p><p>1. A weekly email newsletter (for the life of the site, maybe longer).  It may be about videogames, it may not.  It may be opinion, a rant, excitement, or about curling.  It will probably happen more than once a week.  You can easily unsubscribe.  Also, as far as I'm concerned, you own this.  If you want to post it on a forum or something, go right ahead.</p><p>2. At least four podcasts a year (for the life of the site) that are tailored to and released to supporters only (either here or on the site when it goes live). Questions/topics/guests...everything is generated by you.  Also, when you download the MP3 it is yours.  Wanna post it on your own blog and charge $15,000 for it?  Go for it.  You own it. </p><p>3. A private forum.  This will be useful to me to communicate with supporters and it will be useful for all of us to feel elitist and high five. I also want to shape my content to my customers as you will be the reason the site exists.  I am beholden to you, not publishers or developers. Also, I may use you guys to crowd-edit my grammar as it's mediocre at best. </p><p>The public forums, however, will not be going live for a few months.  Three months from the site's launch at the absolute latest. </p><h3>My inspiration:</h3><p>NeoGAF and Fugazi.  GAF because it is a completely independent entity that does not worry for a second about how the industry reacts to it. Fugazi because they are the model of doing everything you aren't supposed to do in an industry and being successful because of hard work, talent, and respect for their fans. It's also worth noting that I feel like Rock, Paper, Shotgun does this in the PC gaming space and that PastaPadre does it in the sports gaming world.  I get motivation from both.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Why the name Dodd Scientifics:</span><br/></p><p>It's the name of my blog now, which makes sense as that's just me and updated randomly and for fun.

We have a number of interesting projects lined up and are already creating a strong and smart community with the people who have donated $15 or more here.  The indiegogo is still my (Pete Dodd) gig but everything else business and money wise is handled by Rich Grisham.  The last two or so weeks of this indiegogo will be the last time you will be able to get a lifetime subscription (see far below for what it entails, and more will be added in the future) for $15.  Having a ""slant towards the consumer"" means more to me than just news stories. It means interacting with members of the site.  Finding out what they want and being nimble enough to move with that. It also means playing videogames (gasp!).  Maybe 1 staff member and 4 subscribers on one team, another staff members and 4 more subscribers on the other team... and play a best out of 7 series of Titanfall (with multiple streams from both sides).  There's many ideas we are fleshing out to make this site more than just news - we really want it to be one of the smartest sites on the internet and we hope to attract those types of gamers to the site and our forums. We also want to play games together. The other sites can have the system wars.As for the design - it's probably going to get resized into weird dimensions by this indiegogo page but here are work in progress looks at what we are trying to do visually. You have until April 26th to get a lifetime subscription for $15 (see details far below) and in the process help us make the best website we can!  Massive Update 3/22/14The suggestion I've heard the most over the last several weeks is ""you need a business guy."" I now have a business guy.  Without further ado...Richard Grisham, host and creator of the Press Row Podcast which is nearing 2 million downloads in less than a year, freelance writer, and corporate ladder climbing business man, approached me about becoming a part of this venture as the head of the business side. Everything this man touches turns to gold. Further details of this partnership will be forthcoming. Jeff Holtzclaw is doing web design and back end work.Mike Phillips will be helping with visual design.There have been other inquiries about the business side of things which we are currently exploring as well. Many writers have offered their services and this isn't the entire list of people who will fill out the staff but here are some of the writers and contributors...Gabriel Galliani. 34, Italy - Associated writer for PlayPress Italy for seven years. Owned his own mom + pop game shop called Kaos Games. Inventor of the Sei una Sega, a 6 in 1 Sega console.Rich McGonigle, 32, Oklahoma, USA - Former community director of Noobtube for 5 years. Staff writer and reviewer for Digitalnoob. Also worked at Gamrank last year, an achievement aggregator. Very prolific in the world of podcasting with 6 years experience and two shows currently. Richard Leahy, 23, England - Has held a number of different jobs at many small sites.  Is currently working on his sociology dissertation about gaming related topics.  Will be looking at the gaming world through a sociologist's lense.  Mike Zupan, 31, New York, USA - Writer for DVDtalk. Blogger for Times Union. Mike has a passion for gaming and is frustrated a lack of critical analysis in the press. Gustavo Lazo, 29, New Jersey, USA - Former staff writer for the New Game Network. Published fiction writer. Self motivated and talented blogger.  Bucky Hacker, 30, Texas, USA - Writer for Texas Bank Lawyer Vol. 37. Article Editor for the Business & Bankruptcy Law Journal, Vol.1. Brings a level of astounding legal knowledge. Contributors:Ahsan Rasheed, 27. Pakistan - Ahsan is a doctor and a recent graduate of Dow University of Health Sciences and holds a degree in MBBS. Being a doctor... he will only contribute rarely but we are excited to see what he has to say when he does.  (more to come, watch this space)If you donate at the $15 tier or higher you get access to the private forum which is not only a good place to chat about games but you also help shape the future of the site.  Here are some of the topics we are talking about currently.Major Update #2Things are moving along swiftly with the campaign.  I have already secured hosting (starting small with a company that can shift us to bigger/better/more expensive servers quickly when needed).  Jeff is working on the backend currently.  We will have a private forum up for everyone who donated over the $15 amount shortly and we will start bouncing ideas off of you guys as to what you want to see and what you don't.I have a stack of over 20 people interested in helping that I will need to sift through as we work out the design side of the site.  We are going with a wordpress backend that we will modify to suit our needs.  I am a minimalist when it comes to design, so the site looking like Polygon/Verge wasn't going to happen even if we raised 3 million dollars.  I did an interview with boogie (the video above, I'm the guy on the left if you don't know who either of us are) which was a huge success and helped generate quite a bit of money.  We are on the home stretch now, less than two weeks to go, and everything is coming together nicely.  As much as I want the funding to go on... as more money will make things easier, I am really looking forward to getting past this step and getting in there and creating something that helps fill a few of the voids in gaming coverage.  The focus will be on the consumer, in everything we do.  We may try things that don't work.  Reviews, for instance, may be a waste of time. We have the man power to give it a shot though.  As for my business plan, there will be a subscription model setup on the site that anyone who hits the $15 tier or higher will be put into (even if more stuff is added that isn't listed there currently).  I have a few ideas of subscriber interaction, like on streaming nights picking a few subscribers at random to team up with and we all can hop on Skype and the stream will be all of us playing, plus our voices.  I could easily do one PS4 night and one XB1 night with that setup.  It would be even more exciting if we could get some industry personalities to join us as well.  Other means of keeping the site sustainable are advertising, which sucks - but required - and just a simple ol' donate button.  Also if we go in a video-heavy direction we will also try to monetize that with YouTube, which - again - sorry for the ads. I also have some ideas in terms of reviews, or mini reviews, looking at games and what their worth is.  Something like breaking down all of the PS4/XB1 launch games and now that they are starting to go on sale what price each becomes worth it (if at all... some games, unfortunately, just aren't worth your time, let alone your money). The ideas are flowing. The funding is picking up.  The site is coming together.  The staff is coming together.  Things are very positive over here right now.  And if you haven't contributed yet - please do! Every cent will help make the site better.Also, if you want to see part two of that interview with boogie, go here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSKupITM0ZEMajor update #1The funding got off to a wonderful start and has slowed down which is usual for anything not made by Inafune, Shafer, or that Scrubs guy.  The hard part has officially begun, which is making the sell to people who have no background info on me, the people who will be helping me, or why this is a worthwhile project.  I also need a stroke of luck... someone with a huge twitter following to tweet about it.  A random article about it that garners a ton of interest.  It's better to be lucky than good, they say.  I would prefer to be both.What I can say is that I have a few ideas to get funding moving (though I do expect it to mostly be flatlined other than a few bumps, which are hopefully large).  Beyond that, however, I've gotten more people willing to help than I ever imagined. This will bring down the costs quite a bit.  I can't change the goal after having started this IGG, but I do feel confident that I'm already pretty close to having enough money to launch the site with a much larger staff than I expected. I believe the legitimacy of the site will happen quicker because of this and normal avenues of funding (advertising, mostly) will kick in sooner than I expected. As I've stated many times, I'm not pocketing a dime of this IGG. It's all going into the site. The main reason to hit the goal at this point are for purity reasons.  The less we have to rely on advertising the better.  Also, IGG pockets a much larger % of the funding for projects that don't hit the goal.  I like Indiegogo, but I'd much rather that money go into the site.Please share this page with as many people as you know.  Tweet it at your favorite YouTubers or other independent gaming voices.  If you are fourth cousins with Ashton Kutcher ask him for a twitter favor. I need you guys for this to work. All in all it's been a spectacular start. I knew the flatline was coming (as it does on all crowd-funding) and now it's time to find a way to push through that.  I will soon have some announcements about uses of the money already earned as construction will begin earlier than I expected.  Other than the worst stomach flu of my life which i just recovered from... these are some extremely exciting times.  ___________________The problem:A major failing of the gaming media is that they are beholden to the companies they cover. Whether they fear being blacklisted and not receiving review copies, or that the journalist in question is using their platform as a springboard to get a job in the industry proper, there often seems to be a conflict of interest: review scores that are far too high, repeating press releases as if they are news, and dismissing facts completely because they go against the narrative they are trying to build...  This is a problem and it seems like gamers have far less trust in these sites because of it.The problem is that a website needs to play ball with publishers to have any chance of success. If you don't get your review up when the embargo is lifted, you will receive far fewer clicks than you would otherwise. If you are critical of a company and they blacklist you so that you no longer get press releases, early screens or videos, or other such materials, it puts you behind your competitors. Life is a thousand times harder for small sites or blacklisted sites because they don't get the access of the bigger sites who have this symbiotic relationship with developers.Dodd Scientifics will not be about any of that.My idea:The site I want to create will be strictly independent. There are certain things we will go along with that are the industry standard, like embargoes and NDA's, but we will not shy away from reporting a story because it may damage our relationship with a publisher. Nor will we fail to give a game a review score we think it deserves because it will anger the publisher, the fanboys, and lessen our chance of being on Metacritic. If we are blacklisted, we will tell you.  If there are gaming companies who refuse to give us any access we will write stories about that.  This whole underbelly of the industry needs to be exposed and eradicated if ""games journalism"" is to survive.  And as an active member at NeoGAF, Reddit, and other popular forums, I'm well aware that the bigger gaming sites are not as invaluable as they may think they are. They (and I) need you a lot more than you need them.I want to do everything that a gaming website shouldn't. This is an approach that is currently believed to be unsustainable.  I'm not arguing that it isn't.  What I'm arguing is that irrespective of this, it needs to exist, and it currently does not.  There are some wonderful independent voices in our community but not a central hub where you can reliably hear from an outsider's perspective.  I've been referred to as ""industry insider Pete Dodd"" when websites publish my tweets as stories, but I want to be the opposite. I don't want to be a part of the industry, I want to look at it from the view of an outsider. Or, as you may know them as... consumers.I would also like to use the website as a platform for talented people in need of exposure. This could range from an indie developer using the site as developer diary to things like gaming related artists, podcasts, comics, and of course writers. In addition, whenever we pull a news story that has been posted elsewhere we will go above and beyond to credit the source.  We won't just say ""Source: Neogaf"" with a link.  We would mention the user by name and even link to that person's personal site if it is in their bio. Likewise if it's pulled from another site we will of course link to the original article but will also name the writer as the source. Sources should be given more credit than they currently are. We plan to do our best to contribute to that.Who am I?My name is Pete Dodd and I am a 36 year old married man with a wonderful wife and no kids (yet?). I've been a freelance writer since the mid-nineties.  I've written for the New Haven Advocate, a newspaper that had a readership of 75k at the time.  I've ghostwritten a psychiatric manual for a therapist located in Vermont (where I lived for several years).  I was offered a position as a freelancer at EGM in the early 00's but gave up on the idea when they moved from Chicago to San Francisco.  I've been a paid blogger on several sites, including being featured on Squidoo.  I also played a significant role in the #PS4NoDRM campaign last year.Outside of writing, I worked in the mental health field for fifteen years.  I worked primarily with adults with autism, teaching them living skills to be more independent.  I also worked with kids who had been through traumatic situations.  It was very rewarding work that I am happy that I did. My personal preferences in games skew towards the Playstation.  I want to be clear about that. I can and will be objective but I think it's important to know what a person's preferences are.  If I get the chance to add more staff, one thing I will really search for is getting people with other preferences so the site can give a wider set of opinions (when opinions are warranted).And last but certainly not least (ok, maybe least), I was one of the Gamers of the Year in 2013 as selected by Kotaku. BOOM!What I need to get this going:As I've considered what I want to do with the site over the last few months, I've come to the conclusion that it can be many things and those things, unfortunately, cost money. First off, the site is happening, no matter what.  I need $8,500 to make this site exist for one year without it making me a penny through advertising.  I don't expect to hit this. With $5000 I believe I can sustain it with the help of advertising and other revenue.   Here's how the pricing breaks down over the course of a year. The essentials:Website design -  DonatedWebsite/podcast hosting - $1000Games and gaming related items: $1000Rent:  ($375 x 12) = $4500Utilities ($100 x 12) = $1200Indiegogo's cut (If I reach the goal - it more than doubles in percentage if I don't.) = $340These are all ballpark figures that can and will move depending on the funding.  The chances of getting of getting exactly $8250 are nearly zero.  This is just an outline of how I would use the money. It can be divided or multiplied depending on what the final numbers end up being.  I don't plan on pocketing a cent from this campaign, every single penny will go into building it and getting other people on board to help me build it. If I am going to profit (and obviously, yes, someday I would like to make money) it will be down the line when it is successful for being different and important to the gaming community.  What could be added?Advertising What if I don't hit my goal?I start subtracting from each category (other than hosting, that number is locked). I can compromise on design.  I can get fewer games.  I can find other avenues to pay for rent and utilities.  This would mean taking on at least a part time job, if not a full time one. The number of times the site is updated daily would of course be impacted by this.  That said, this is a passion and not a money making scheme, so I will use every penny to achieve my goals the best I can.  I feel as though I have a solid track record behind me to give confidence in this.  Over 600 posts on my Doddscientifics blog, 31,000 tweets, and 6500 posts on GAF point to an obsessive who can't stop writing about videogames.Site details:General news stories will be presented with 2 or 3 sections, depending on how much we know.Facts----->Conjecture---->RumorsSo let's say that Respawn announces that a day one patch will change the player count from the announced 6v6 to 8v8.  The news will be presented as objectively as possible under the Facts section.In the Conjecture section I would say something like ""Six versus Six never felt empty in the beta but eight versus eight will definitely add to the chaos.  There were some framerate dips in the Xbox One beta so we will be keeping a close eye on how smoothly things go with the higher player count.And, if there is a rumor that is known to us that we believe to be credible (two sources is my personal rule) we will add that.  Example: ""This may not be the end of expanding the player count for Titanfall, sources close to the game say they hope to increase the player count further by the time the first DLC pack hits.""None of that is true by the way. It's just an example. The benefits of this three-tier news reporting is that if all you want is the news, you start at the top and read the facts and then you click off the page.  If you want to know what we think, you keep reading.  If you want to hear rumors, you keep reading beyond that.  I don't want to force an opinion down anyone's throat with news, so I believe compartmentalizing it like this is the best way to include everything without crossing boundaries.Reviews.  One to five stars.  No half stars.  Reviews are genre based.  Reviews will go up when they are ready - number of clicks be damned.Five represents the pinnacle of the genre and will likely pull in non-fans.Four equals a strong game that fans of the genre will enjoy greatly.Three equals an average game in the genre.Two means super-fans of the genre may be able to eke out some fun, but there are too many issues for most gamers.One equals no redeeming qualities.Why genre based? Because some people like certain genres more than others.  A three for a  turn-based strategy game may mean more than a four for a first-person shooter to a certain person.  This keeps review scores comparing apples to apples instead of apples to oranges.Editorials - Free form.  It must be thought provoking and expressed in an intelligent way. That's the only rule here.Videos and Streaming -  I have a capture card and a very nice camera already, so videos are definitely something I plan on doing. I also stream quite a bit already.  My plan with the site is to have set nights where I stream games - hopefully showing off new games that up-and-coming developers want to get noticed.  Eventually, if audience participation gets going (and I know first hand this is *very* difficult to achieve), the streaming nights will be voted on in advance as to what I play.  Forums: A private forum for supporters. A public forum will be opened as well.  Interviews - I am interested in digging deeper than the usual interview. I believe this will keep most major publishers/developers away from me as it is out of PR's comfort zone. I'm not looking to be ""gotcha"" in interviews, but I do want to know more than reguritated fact sheets about the games.  I want to know why someone creates games.  I want to know how they feel when they have an idea and play it pre-alpha for the first time and how that feels.  I believe most of the people who would read a site like this are interested in this process also.  How hard is crunch?  Is it worth it? What does it do to your personal life? What effect does money have? What change do you regret the most?  I want to dig deep.  Will I be allowed to?  Probably not.  I don't care, I'm going to try.Comments - Moderately moderated, likely through community voting. This seems to fly in the face of everything else I'm trying to do with this site but there's a very good reason for it.  Most comments are useless trolling.  Those will be erased.  If you have something interesting to say, even if it disputes every single point we put forth, your comment would not be moderated. But the general rule of the internet is ""don't read the comments"".  I agree with that rule.  I will either moderate them heavily or turn them off.  Petty console war squabbles after every story have no point. I know they can be addictive and keep users on your site longer, which would increase the amount of revenue I make from advertising but, again, I don't care. I'm creating the unsustainable website.  A platform for talented people -  I plan on giving links to podcasts I love, youtube videos I love, artists I think are talented, comics I think are funny, and blogs I find interesting.  If people want to help with the site, be it news or reviews or editorials, there is a high bar for entry as I cringe at writing worse than my own (ok, so maybe the bar isn't very high).  I do want to be a platform for people to share their work with the world though. If you have talent, I am interested.  It's that simple.Advertising -  Yep. Google adsense.  Hopefully not to the point of being tacky.  I recommend using the adblock add-on that Chrome (and I assume other browsers) has. I hate looking at ads. I will probably use it on my own site. I won't blame anyone else who does the same. Again, unsustainable, but... enjoyable? That's the hope.Reward Tiers <----Full description here because of lack of character space in perk listThis campaign is not about rewards. I am doing this solo and it's just not feasible for me to create a bunch of trinkets and whatnot.  If you believe in the idea and think I can pull it off, I would love a donation. If you want more, check out what's below, but it's not all that impressive.  Everything listed here is available at the $15 tier and higher and is a lifetime subscription.  A yearly subscription will be available when the site launches.  1. A weekly email newsletter (for the life of the site, maybe longer).  It may be about videogames, it may not.  It may be opinion, a rant, excitement, or about curling.  It will probably happen more than once a week.  You can easily unsubscribe.  Also, as far as I'm concerned, you own this.  If you want to post it on a forum or something, go right ahead.2. At least four podcasts a year (for the life of the site) that are tailored to and released to supporters only (either here or on the site when it goes live). Questions/topics/guests...everything is generated by you.  Also, when you download the MP3 it is yours.  Wanna post it on your own blog and charge $15,000 for it?  Go for it.  You own it. 3. A private forum.  This will be useful to me to communicate with supporters and it will be useful for all of us to feel elitist and high five. I also want to shape my content to my customers as you will be the reason the site exists.  I am beholden to you, not publishers or developers. Also, I may use you guys to crowd-edit my grammar as it's mediocre at best. The public forums, however, will not be going live for a few months.  Three months from the site's launch at the absolute latest. My inspiration:NeoGAF and Fugazi.  GAF because it is a completely independent entity that does not worry for a second about how the industry reacts to it. Fugazi because they are the model of doing everything you aren't supposed to do in an industry and being successful because of hard work, talent, and respect for their fans. It's also worth noting that I feel like Rock, Paper, Shotgun does this in the PC gaming space and that PastaPadre does it in the sports gaming world.  I get motivation from both.Why the name Dodd Scientifics:It's the name of my blog now, which makes sense as that's just me and updated randomly and for fun. I wanted to come up with a name for this site that didn't include my last name as I felt that was egotistical. My wife wouldn't let me. She wields more power than EA.  Sounds good. What can I do?Donate, obviously, if you can.  I understand that many of you can't.  Hell, I can't. If you still want to help the best thing you can do is get the word out about this, link to it, use the sharing tools that are built in if you want.Or, if you hate me, spend a lot of your energy making this not happen, because that will probably help me.

<p>Simulacracea has been in development for over two years, and as of the launch of this campaign, is on-schedule to launch on May 15th, 2020 on Steam, Itch.io and Gamejolt! The game has been fully written, and an alpha testing build should be finished sometime in February!</p>
<p>Up until this point, development of the game has been funded entirely out-of-pocket, which was not a problem until the topic of localization came up. Because Simulacracea is a visual novel-style game, reading is a crucial aspect of the experience, meaning that localizing the game into other languages is crucial to ensuring as many people can enjoy the game as possible!</p>
<p>The good news is that localization was a planned feature of Simulacracea early on, so the main game 'script' that has all of the dialogue and option text can be easily sent to the translators for edits and then reincorporated into the game with little hassle! The bad news is that Simulacracea's script is approximately 160,000 words long (about the length of many novels!), meaning that localizing the full game will be costly.</p>

<p>As a game that deals with mental illness, Simulacracea has been a very meaningful project for all of its team members. We drew from our personal experiences with mental illness when writing this game. People who have tried out early versions of the game have related to the discussions of anxiety, self-harm, depression, therapy, and other mental health topics that come up in the game. As a result, we feel that we have a responsibility to try and get the game out to as wide an audience as we can, and localization is one way of doing that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of our work on the game has gone unpaid and all outside contractors have been paid out-of-pocket, and were it not for the prohibitive costs of localizing, we would gladly pay for this out-of-pocket as well. We want this game to be as successful and effective as we possible, and have done as much as we can to shoulder all of the costs necessary to make it work until now. We've reached our limit, and now we need your help. <br/> </p>

<p>The name SweetWhale is a play on words for the Korean term for loyal or frequent customer, ë‹¨ê³¨ (<em>dahn-gol</em>), which sounds pretty similar to ë‹¨ê³ ëž˜ (<em>dahn-gorae</em>),  which literally means 'sweet whale'. Trust us, in Korean it makes a lot more sense!</p>
<p>SweetWhale or ë‹¨ê³ ëž˜, is a free loyalty stamp card app for iOS and Android devices. It allows customers to conveniently collect rewards stamps on their smartphones, eliminating the need to manage those pesky paper cards. But SweetWhale isn't just an app. For our subscribing merchants we're able to provide an unique marketing service to help create more loyal customers who'll return more quickly, more often. With features such as push messaging, vendors can instantly send promotional messages and special offers to their existing customers. SweetWhale users can also easily share their activity on Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare allowing businesses to be seen by a larger audience of potential customers. And SweetWhale also provide merchants with analytics about who their customers are and their visiting habits. </p>
<p><strong>How We Started</strong></p>
<p>The seed for SweetWhale was planted years ago when a couple of us visited Seoul and realized how ubiquitous these stamp cards were at all the restaurants and cafes we frequented. We reluctantly collected them, but thought there needed to be a better, more simple solution to this paper model. Fast forward to late 2011 when a group of us decided to do something these old fashion paper cards.</p>
<p><strong>How We're Doing</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, the ball is already rolling on our project. The app was launched here in Seoul in early March 2012 and is currently available for free on the Apple App Store and Google Play. With hardly any marketing budget in place we've been able to garner over 2000 downloads and secure over 40 participating vendors in just a span of 3 months. We have a terrific network of vendors and users that love our product and we only want to make our app better and continue to expand our reach!</p>
<p><strong>The Polygonik Team</strong></p>
<p>There are 5 founding members -- Bruce Suh, Jason Park, Hank Kang, Paul Yi and DJ Lee. We have a diverse range of experiences and educational backgrounds; some of us have worked in high tech, corporate real estate, and financial services just to name a few. Our company name, Polygonik, which means having many angles, many sides, was chosen to describe our assembled team.</p>
<p><strong>Why in Seoul</strong></p>
<p>Truthfully, we think Seoul is the perfect city for a product such as SweetWhale. If you've ever visited the city you'd be hard-pressed to disagree. With the overwhelming number of cafes, restaurants and shops, the shear population of the city (+24M in the metropolitan area), the number of smartphone users (+26M nationwide), and the tech savviness of its citizens, this city more than any other is ripe for a product and service such as ours.</p>
<p><strong>We Need YOU!</strong></p>

The name SweetWhale is a play on words for the Korean term for loyal or frequent customer, ë‹¨ê³¨ (dahn-gol), which sounds pretty similar to ë‹¨ê³ ëž˜ (dahn-gorae),  which literally means 'sweet whale'. Trust us, in Korean it makes a lot more sense!
SweetWhale or ë‹¨ê³ ëž˜, is a free loyalty stamp card app for iOS and Android devices. It allows customers to conveniently collect rewards stamps on their smartphones, eliminating the need to manage those pesky paper cards. But SweetWhale isn't just an app. For our subscribing merchants we're able to provide an unique marketing service to help create more loyal customers who'll return more quickly, more often. With features such as push messaging, vendors can instantly send promotional messages and special offers to their existing customers. SweetWhale users can also easily share their activity on Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare allowing businesses to be seen by a larger audience of potential customers. And SweetWhale also provide merchants with analytics about who their customers are and their visiting habits. 
How We Started
The seed for SweetWhale was planted years ago when a couple of us visited Seoul and realized how ubiquitous these stamp cards were at all the restaurants and cafes we frequented. We reluctantly collected them, but thought there needed to be a better, more simple solution to this paper model. Fast forward to late 2011 when a group of us decided to do something these old fashion paper cards.
How We're Doing
Fortunately, the ball is already rolling on our project. The app was launched here in Seoul in early March 2012 and is currently available for free on the Apple App Store and Google Play. With hardly any marketing budget in place we've been able to garner over 2000 downloads and secure over 40 participating vendors in just a span of 3 months. We have a terrific network of vendors and users that love our product and we only want to make our app better and continue to expand our reach!
The Polygonik Team
There are 5 founding members -- Bruce Suh, Jason Park, Hank Kang, Paul Yi and DJ Lee. We have a diverse range of experiences and educational backgrounds; some of us have worked in high tech, corporate real estate, and financial services just to name a few. Our company name, Polygonik, which means having many angles, many sides, was chosen to describe our assembled team.
Why in Seoul
Truthfully, we think Seoul is the perfect city for a product such as SweetWhale. If you've ever visited the city you'd be hard-pressed to disagree. With the overwhelming number of cafes, restaurants and shops, the shear population of the city (+24M in the metropolitan area), the number of smartphone users (+26M nationwide), and the tech savviness of its citizens, this city more than any other is ripe for a product and service such as ours.
We Need YOU!
Although we have a romanticized vision of world domination, we are a startup. Until now we have had ZERO investors, ZERO loans, nor have we asked or received any handouts. So far we've been able to survive on our own two feet and bootstrapping this operation on a super lean basis. But the time has come to send out the signal and ask our friends, families, and even strangers for their support.
Financial support from our Indiegogo backers will go directly towards hiring a part-time designer, covering production costs of our marketing materials, renting an office, as well as feeding our interns and weening off our ramen habit.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>Roll the dice and choose your fate: Killer or Victim.</p>
<p>Killers start out as sweet little cubs...Crazy Cubs that is. Have you ever looked at a child and known something was just a little off about them? That kid you wouldn't trust with a sharp stick, much less a box of matches. That's the crazy inside, just waiting to grow up and cut loose on the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474599937/lm7pvzzepxblrxifd7ah.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As a killer, that is your goal, to grow up, find your triggers, choose your skills, gather your weapons and let the crazy out...just make sure no one else steals your kill.</p>

<p>Victims start out as...well...every day, ordinary bears. There you are, minding your own business, when suddenly you are the target of not just one, but up to four different killers.</p>

<p>Use your skills, wit, and cunning to fend off your enemies and land them in jail...or six feet under.</p>

<p>The goal for the Killers is to be the one to kill the victim, while making sure no one else gets in your way. The goal of the victim is to survive and take out the killers...</p>
<p>Or you can play the Blood Bath option. Killer versus killer, may the Baddest Bear win.</p>
<p>The Dream</p>
<p>We had a dream. That dream was to create a new game, targeted towards adults, young and old, who share our love of gaming and slightly twisted sense of humor. Irreverence, bear on bear violence, and humor are the name of the game (no pun intended, though there are plenty in the game that are). Well actually, the name of the game is Bad Bears, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>In this age of cell phones, email, instant messaging, gaming apps, and other technological communication marvels we are losing touch with each other. How many times have you sat across from friend, family, your significant other and spent half your time (or even more) staring at your phone? What does it take to get people to set those phones aside and engage in a friendly game? Hopefully this. Cut loose, have fun, settle an argument, cause mayhem and bloodshed, all without the pesky cleanup or uncomfortable explanations.</p>
<h3>Who are the creators of Bad Bears?</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Loria Chaddon. Together with my husband, Scott Chaddon, we have created a new player-vs-player card game aimed at other adults who need a little distraction from the stresses of our lives. Our hope is to bring a little much needed fun to the world, while managing to build a business (Wandering Wolf Press, LLC) that we can be proud of.</li>
<li>All the photography was done by me. I have been a photographer professionally, and in my free time, for 9 years.</li>
<li>All of the non-photographic art was done by Scott. He has been an artist since he could hold a crayon, and earned a Bachelor's in Art at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.</li>
<li>All of the quotes and sayings on the cards were either written by us or, rarely, one of our favorite authors (with all due credit given, of course).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why are we asking for your help?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lets be honest, we are asking for your help in getting this game produced because, like so many of you, we have worked long and hard and still seem to be struggling to keep our heads above water. We are hoping that our hard work, and your interest in fun, will help us to actually get a little closer to that American Dream we were all told was possible, but so few have reached. </li>
<li>If we can do that, if we can make our business a success, maybe we will be able to pay it forward by helping others get a little closer to their own dreams through our fledgling publishing company, both by helping new authors and writers get their names out there, and actually being able to provide a few jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>We are hoping to raise at least $7500. This amount will allow us to print out our first run of cards, produce a little merchandise, buy items we can photograph to add to available cards, and start marketing the game. Creation is almost complete. Development costs have been reasonable, so far, since I am a photographer, he is an artist, and we are both writers. (Granted, we have been working without pay, and that may be against the law. I might have to fine myself. LOL) Unfortunately, mass production is not cheap. That is where you, dear future players, come in.</li>
<li>Anything we raise over and above our initial expenses will be used to produce more decks, expand our business, and start the production of our booster and expansion packs. (Yes, those are already in the works as well.)</li>
<li>Each of our perk levels are named after a player level in the game, and provide you something for your generosity.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use the money donated to fulfill our perk obligations, and produce as many decks as possible in order to move forward with our plans. By no means are we willing to give up so easily.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will help us move forward in our plan to produce this somewhat twisted, yet fun, game and bring something different to the world of gaming. Any help you are wiling and able to give is appreciated more than you know. Every dollar raised here will enable us to speed up the production process and get that much closer to our dream coming true.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div> </div><div>
<p>If you are intrigued and would like to see this game be produced (even if just to find out how a can of beets can bring a Bad Bear down) but cannot contribute from a monetary standpoint, you can still help us get the word out. Actually, we would love it if you would get the word out either way. Laugh</p>
<p>Here is how you can help spread the word:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your enemies, (you know beating them to a bloody pulp in a game would bring some serious satisfaction) tell random strangers. Everyone you tell is another person who might find a new appreciation for Teddy Bears.</li>
<li>Share! Share! Share! The more you use the Indiegogo share tools, the more people who will be intrigued by our game.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Help us go the distance, and have some fun in the process. Thank you in advance.</p></div>","***Disclaimer: This game is not politically correct. Recommended age is 17 and up.

From now everyone contriibuting 5USD will receive „infinite coins“ code allowing to play for free all subsequent, monetized games to be added to compilation in future updates. For those pledging 25USD we will also gift a code to download our first game „DeadEnd: Cerebral Vortex“ from „Gamersgate“</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS „TOUCHIES“?</strong></p>
<p>„Touchies“ is a compilation of simple smartphone games with a twist. The idea was born, when we developed a mini game „Finger Brawl“ which had a single „multiplayer on the same device“ mode. We were trying to make the game competitive, lively and most importantly - with significant amount of direct confrontation. After play-testing it with our families, friends and just random people we‘ve met on the streets, we learned that our design is truly attractive. Most players enjoyed the game and we observed them laughing, trying out different play styles and tempo to compete or just to have fun together.</p>
<p><br/>That was outstanding, so we showed our game to fellow developers to ask their opinion, and we learned that our game design is faulty. You see, most of our colleagues deemed touching each other during gameplay as a flaw, so they suggested dividing playfield, or finding other mechanics to eliminate direct player contact. That was really strange, since „touching“ a person was our main goal. How come that touching, one of the most important ways of perception and communication, is considered a bug?</p>
<p><br/>We won’t fix it. We decided to do quite the contrary and improve upon our mechanics.</p>
<p><br/><strong>THE HUMAN TOUCH</strong></p>
<p><br/>We’re all gamers and there’s a lot of stuff going on within the industry that we really like. We love mainstream, casual and social games, hell - we even like most of ideas introduced at E3 this year, but… At some point it’s starting to get weird. It’s simply going a bit too far. The idea of complementary screen in single player games, or an option to have a part of your gaming universe in a pocket is really cool. But imagine the party were gamers gather to spend their time together for a small FIFA tournament, but instead of watching each other play or just having some beer, people in the same room get out their phones, start shooting screenshots, tweeting match results and engaging in other social activities with huge amount of internauts, who probably don’t even give a damn about it.</p>
<p><br/>Playing games is natural to us. We do it from our first days on earth. As babies we get to know ourselves and the world by simply playing with stuff and touching it. And it stays this way for the rest of our lives. Inevitably, the most precious and important perception seems to be limited to glass. We look at it and we touch it, relying on sole power of imagination. It starts to look natural and it’s a bit scary.</p>
<p><br/>But don’t get us wrong, we’re not here to change the world, we don’t even believe that single game or application is able to change anything, change must come through a series of small events in many different fields. What we’re hoping to achieve is a simple alternative, and with a bit of luck, we could start people talking about the problems that lead to social alienation.</p>
<p><br/><strong>CURRENT STATE OF A PROJECT</strong></p>
<p><br/>Currently we have 3 working mini games and twice as many prototypes. We switched to a mini game compilation, simply because our original „Finger Brawl“ tends to be competitive, perhaps even a bit aggressive game, so we developed additional games focusing on different gameplay experiences. We will have a „Castle Crush“ game involving some strategic elements and perhaps co-op play. We will have „Boil Me“ — slower cooperative game with a romantic twist. We will have simple games for families, designed in a way where parents get to participate in play and mentor their kids. We will have many more small games focusing on puzzle elements, agility, common knowledge, etc. All our games will be multiplayer on the same device, and designed in a such a way that touching your opponent will be inevitable.<br/>Currently we’re polishing our first three games for launch and we have a plan to add new games on a timely manner.</p>
<p><br/><strong>THE TEAM</strong></p>
<p><br/>We’re Arvydas, Marius and Arthur. Team „Membranos“ was founded a year ago and we self-published our first game „Dead End: Cerebral Vortex“. Arthur joined the team a bit later, when we started our work with „Touchies“. Currently all of us have primary jobs, so „Touchies“ is a sort of a hobby.</p>
<p><br/><strong>WHY DO WE NEED CROWD FUNDING?</strong></p>
<p><br/>Well, there are many reasons, swinging from season change to lack of hardware, so let’s go on step by step:</p>
<p><br/>• Summer is over and we put a huge part of it into this project. We made a couple of games, play-tested them and tried to find the necessary finances. We didn’t secure a sufficient amount, but our vacation’s over and we’re about to get back to our primary responsibilities. So it’s now or never situation for us and „Touchies“ and we would prefer „Now“.</p>
<p><br/>• We’re developing the games on „Unity“ engine, so it can be released on „Android“ and „iOS“ platform. We would like it to happen simultaneously, but we don’t have any hardware to port game for „iOS“. So we basically need a Mac and a couple of iPhone’s for play-testing purposes.</p>
<p><br/>• We would like to support our launch with a website and game dedicated videos. Also we will probably need to hire additional artist to produce more assets for current and upcoming games.</p>
<p><br/><strong>LET’S MAKE THIS HAPPEN!</strong></p>
<p><br/>We’re releasing „Touchies“ as a freemium game at the end of September, that’s bound to happen, since we don’t have a lot of choice. How big and nice the launch will be? Well, it basically depends on you — the crowd. We’re all on the same boat here and if you’re seeing the same problems as we do, please help us spread our words and ideas further. Your support will be used to get the necessary hardware. We will polish and play-test our app, also we will launch a website and a social network page sharing the information about our game and why we believe „touching each other“ is not a bug.</p>
<p>You can support us by donating an amount of your choice and also by simply spreading the word around. We’ll take all we can get!</p></div>","***UPDATE 09.09*** We decided to adjust our perk system.

We will polish and play-test our app, also we will launch a website and a social network page sharing the information about our game and why we believe „touching each other“ is not a bug.
You can support us by donating an amount of your choice and also by simply spreading the word around. We’ll take all we can get!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About me and the project</h3>
My name's Joe Incorvaya and I'm a uni student and indie dev living in the south of wales, I've made a couple of games to date, which you can try out at <a href=""http://www.inkidia.net,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.inkidia.net,</a> and am currently working on my newest project: Voltorometer 2.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Voltorometer 2 is the sequel to a game I made back in june 2006, there was also a remake of the game released in the same year and a flash port of the remake released in 2010.</div>
<div>The game is going to be released on my site as a freeware game, but there'll also be the option to pay a donation for it if you want to support me.</div>

<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.inkidia.net/images/Screenshots/Voltorometer2-1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The game is a challenging platformer set across 8 worlds and based on the concept of running through levels as quickly as possible and whilst taking as little damage as possible to get a higher score. The higher your score, the better your rank at the end of the world, a better rank will unlock extras in the game such as challenge levels, characters and new game modes.</div>

<h3>Why I'm asking for funding</h3>
<p>I'm looking for funding because although I can code and make simple sprites for my games, I can't make music. The funds I raise would be used mainly to pay my composer for the music he makes, but anything over will be used to both commission new tracks to be made and to increase the amount of content in the game in general.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>For the $1 perk I'll send you an email when the game is released as well as a link to download the game.</p>
<p>For the $5 perk you'll get the $1 perk and I'll put your name in the credits at the end of the game.</p>
<p><br/>For the $25 perk you'll get both the $1 and $5 perks and I'll send you some hand drawn concept art of enemies/environments/characters from the game.</p>
<p>For the $50 perk you'll get all the previous perks plus, you'll get the ability to specify a type of level and its name and I'll design it and add it to the game, it will be playable in every copy of the game. <br/>You can be as specific as you want and the theme of the level isn't restricted to any of the types of levels in the game, it can be anything (within reason, it has to be SFW), if you want me to make a level based on cake, then I'll make a level based on cake with it's own unique enemies and other assets, but if you just ask me to make a really hard water level, then that's fine too.<br/>The concept art you receive will also be art of things that I design for your level.</p>
<p>For the $100 perk, you get all the previous perks plus I'll let you design your own unlockable character that will be playable in every copy of the game.<br/>The design follows the same rules as the level in that it can be anything as long as it's within reason, is SFW and doesn't infringe any copyrights.<br/>You can also specify unique abilities for the character and I'll add them in (but I'll be balancing things so that they have weaknesses compared to other characters)</p>

<p><em><strong>Word Clash,</strong> </em>the new free multiplayer word puzzle game. Battle your way to the top by smashing your opponents, puzzle after puzzle. Gain rank and unlock power ups to use against your enemy and win! Play against your friends too and make them bow to your power, haha, just kidding, don't do that 0.0.</p>
<p>The game is simple. You are presented with a grid [1] full of letters and some solid blocks. You can touch and drag the letters around. The point of the game is to be the fist person to successfully get all his/her letters into the right spots, making up the words given to you in the word list at the bottom [3]. Some tricks to the game involve using power ups [4] to either disable your opponent (Time Stopper, Sabotage) or to give you an edge (Hint, Points Multiplier). There is also the <em>Enemy View</em> [5]<em> </em>which shows you the opponents completed words. This feature allows you to catch up and keep the battle intensity high. Keeping this in mind allows you to work out a strategy to conquer your enemy! At the end of the game you are presented with your points earnings which are used to increase your rank. As you climb higher on the totem pole, you unlock different power ups and bonuses.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I come to you today in search of your energy, enthusiasm, support, and ofcourse capital. For the past several months I've been developing a game that boldly stands apart from my previous horror-inspired work titled Iron Weasels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The premise of this game is to re-capture the kinetic feel of arcade titles like Joust, Defender, and Sopwith while encapsulating it in a manic cartoonish spy-vs-spy like rivalry set between two wreckless weasel-like pilots with no concern for their own safety.  The playing fields run the gamut of a bright spring day to a city besieged by a gigantic skyscraper-chucking monster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's where you come in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In an ideal world I could live forever off fanfare and cheers.  I would also have my own giant skull fortress in the caman islands staffed by hench-women in catsuits with lazer-teeth.  Sadly, this is not the case.  I need your financial support as I continue to wrap this project up, find a sponsor or publisher, and get it into your hands in the best way possible.  Game development has become my dayjob, and there's no salary, health insurance, company car, or skull fortress in this line of work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So in summation, I love this game.  I know you're going to love it too.  I can't wait to get it out there to watch youtubes of you all pwning eachother in the skies, raining bits of firey shrapnel down upon carnival go-ers and children with balloons.  For that to happen, I'm going to need to hear some action from the generous back section.  Don't make me beg, my begging barrel is in the shoppe.</p>

you like playing online games on your smartphone? The Tapforme founder enjoys it too. That's
why one day he asked himself what if many routine aspects of mobile games
(that typically take a lot of time) could be automated?</p><p>That is a perfect solution for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>skipping
	monotonous actions that usually need your attention but are
	not that enthralling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enjoying
	best parts of a game and participating only when you want to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>getting
	more free time (and time for repose) and constantly increasing your
	hero's progress.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>It
took a few months of experimenting, research and tinkering to answer this challenges. To
achieve what we have today, it cost about 250 man-hours and around
1,000 lines of actual code. Those are debatable metrics, but it can
still give you a grasp of the amount of effort already invested in
the prototype, and that's only the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We
introduce you Tapforme – a mobile application that performs routine
tasks in online games.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079667/files/20141208014751-features.png?1418032071"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1080287/files/20141208064042-how_does_it_work.png?1418049642"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The
early proof-of-concept Tapforme version is already impressive. At the
moment, our program is able to play Heroes of Dragon Age and Angry
Birds automatically.
<p>Right
now, while you are browsing the Tapforme campaign page, it collects a
few dozen rare creatures in daily PVE events, not to mention gaining
experience and gold. During PVP, it also gathers crystals, runes and
wisps – essentially anything you would have to do manually. Once
the task is completed, it locks the device and goes to sleep until it
has fresh stamina and energy again.</p>
<p>Take
a look at some Tapforme achievements during one HoDA game session:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079660/files/20141208014307-GOT.png?1418031787"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>You
might
have missed it but you didn’t! Tapforme does it for you while you are sleeping.<br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tapforme is a standalone app that you launch a game from. Every action the app
performs is the same as if performed by yourself.  For the game it looks
like you are online i.e. the app makes the effect of your presence in
the game. The only difference is that a set of routine actions you
define in the settings are performed automatically. The game goes on
in the real time, but you do not have to touch the screen – Tapforme will do
everything for you. It is absolutely safe both for your device and
for your game account. As the app performs only allowed actions in
the real time, it is neither cheating nor hacking. The app collects
no personal information and never asks for your password to game
account.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079661/files/20141208014353-ONE-CLICK_COMMAND.png?1418031833"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Tapforme
is here to make life easier for players and that is why we do not
strive to complicate it with additional profiles (at least for now –
leave your feedback!) or intricate setting systems. After logging in,
you will see a list of supported games and a number of simple
settings for each of them. On this page, you can define how long the
app should run, how many cycles it has to cover and what actions it
may perform.</p><p>For example, you can allow the app to participate in
PVPs or only in PVEs, it’s up to you! The
settings may be changed at any time and the app requires no special
attention after that. Now
you can launch the game by tapping one button and simply go to bed or
listen to a lecture while your smartphone is playing for you.</p>
<p>It’s
easy. This is simply technology at
your service.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079671/files/20141208014902-DETAILED_STATISTICS.png?1418032142"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>One
of the many good things about the Tapforme is
that it offers more complete and detailed statistics than the game itself. Tapforme collects various interesting information. You
can find out how many hours the app was online per day, week, month or year,
compare statistics for different periods (presented by fancy visual
graphs) and examine the peak moments of your engagement.</p>
<p>And that is only time-related
statistics! Additionally,
you will be able to examine:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PVP
	victory ratio</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how
	much resources Tapforme has collected for you<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how
	the resources were used by the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079674/files/20141208014940-screen_sketch.png?1418032180"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079680/files/20141208015039-SAFETY_AND_SHARING.png?1418032239"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Tapforme will give you no unfair advantages in the game – it is not cheating whatsoever. The only thing
you get is your free time and free hands! All the extra things you
are going to get with the app you can get by yourself, but at the
expense of a night spent playing. With Tapforme, you make bulk
actions perform automatically and can free your time for something
else. Tell us if we are wrong, but is it not really exciting?</p>
<p>The
app is safe for your phone and game account. It plays the game just
like you would and in real time. The
app imitates the presence of the user. In fact, you stay online, but
you do not have to keep touching the screen and checking the process.</p>
<p>The
app is not intended to create personal profiles or players’
communities inside the game, but instead, it lets you share your
improved, more detailed statistics with other players. Open the
statistics screen, save it as an image and post it to your guild’s
forum or send it as an email.</p><p>Take
a look at early-prototype user design:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079687/files/20141208015138-Screenshot_prototype_800x500.jpg?1418032298"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079689/files/20141208015220-IS_IT_LEGAL.png?1418032340"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Totally.
Tapforme
does not interfere with the game code in any way. The app will never
ask you to provide personal information or make any changes in the
game account (it has no impact on your account at all). No hacking or
cheat
codes,
but
pure automation.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079691/files/20141208015331-WHO_IS_TAPFORME_FOR.png?1418032411"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We
think of Tapforme
as both a social project and a convenient tool for online game
players. The app is designed to not only improve the results of a few
active players, but also to ensure more fun from playing with less
effort.</p>
<p>Tapforme
is a must if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>are
	an active player, maybe even a part of a clan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>want
	to get better results by fair means and less effort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>play
	from time to time, just for fun</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>want
	to automate routine actions and get back to play when you are in the
	mood. Have more fun with your favorite parts of the game and spend
	less time on monotonous actions,
	such as farming for resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have
	to balance between your interest in the game and your real life –
	school, work, friends and sleep</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would let the app work while you are away</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have
	a relative, friend or kid who likes playing games. Don’t judge,
	just give the app to this person and help him or her to find a
	trade-off between the game and social life.</p>

</ul></div>","Do
you like playing online games on your smartphone? The Tapforme founder enjoys it too. That's
why one day he asked himself what if many routine aspects of mobile games
(that typically take a lot of time) could be automated?That is a perfect solution for:


skipping
	monotonous actions that usually need your attention but are
	not that enthralling


enjoying
	best parts of a game and participating only when you want to


getting
	more free time (and time for repose) and constantly increasing your
	hero's progress.



It
took a few months of experimenting, research and tinkering to answer this challenges. To
achieve what we have today, it cost about 250 man-hours and around
1,000 lines of actual code. Those are debatable metrics, but it can
still give you a grasp of the amount of effort already invested in
the prototype, and that's only the beginning.

We
introduce you Tapforme – a mobile application that performs routine
tasks in online games.The
early proof-of-concept Tapforme version is already impressive. At the
moment, our program is able to play Heroes of Dragon Age and Angry
Birds automatically.
Right
now, while you are browsing the Tapforme campaign page, it collects a
few dozen rare creatures in daily PVE events, not to mention gaining
experience and gold. During PVP, it also gathers crystals, runes and
wisps – essentially anything you would have to do manually. Once
the task is completed, it locks the device and goes to sleep until it
has fresh stamina and energy again.
Take
a look at some Tapforme achievements during one HoDA game session:You
might
have missed it but you didn’t! Tapforme does it for you while you are sleeping.

Tapforme is a standalone app that you launch a game from. Every action the app
performs is the same as if performed by yourself.  For the game it looks
like you are online i.e. the app makes the effect of your presence in
the game. The only difference is that a set of routine actions you
define in the settings are performed automatically. The game goes on
in the real time, but you do not have to touch the screen – Tapforme will do
everything for you. It is absolutely safe both for your device and
for your game account. As the app performs only allowed actions in
the real time, it is neither cheating nor hacking. The app collects
no personal information and never asks for your password to game
account.Tapforme
is here to make life easier for players and that is why we do not
strive to complicate it with additional profiles (at least for now –
leave your feedback!) or intricate setting systems. After logging in,
you will see a list of supported games and a number of simple
settings for each of them. On this page, you can define how long the
app should run, how many cycles it has to cover and what actions it
may perform.For example, you can allow the app to participate in
PVPs or only in PVEs, it’s up to you! The
settings may be changed at any time and the app requires no special
attention after that. Now
you can launch the game by tapping one button and simply go to bed or
listen to a lecture while your smartphone is playing for you.
It’s
easy. This is simply technology at
your service.One
of the many good things about the Tapforme is
that it offers more complete and detailed statistics than the game itself. Tapforme collects various interesting information. You
can find out how many hours the app was online per day, week, month or year,
compare statistics for different periods (presented by fancy visual
graphs) and examine the peak moments of your engagement.
And that is only time-related
statistics! Additionally,
you will be able to examine:


PVP
	victory ratio


how
	much resources Tapforme has collected for you


how
	the resources were used by the application.


Tapforme will give you no unfair advantages in the game – it is not cheating whatsoever. The only thing
you get is your free time and free hands! All the extra things you
are going to get with the app you can get by yourself, but at the
expense of a night spent playing. With Tapforme, you make bulk
actions perform automatically and can free your time for something
else. Tell us if we are wrong, but is it not really exciting?
The
app is safe for your phone and game account. It plays the game just
like you would and in real time. The
app imitates the presence of the user. In fact, you stay online, but
you do not have to keep touching the screen and checking the process.
The
app is not intended to create personal profiles or players’
communities inside the game, but instead, it lets you share your
improved, more detailed statistics with other players. Open the
statistics screen, save it as an image and post it to your guild’s
forum or send it as an email.Take
a look at early-prototype user design:Totally.
Tapforme
does not interfere with the game code in any way. The app will never
ask you to provide personal information or make any changes in the
game account (it has no impact on your account at all). No hacking or
cheat
codes,
but
pure automation.We
think of Tapforme
as both a social project and a convenient tool for online game
players. The app is designed to not only improve the results of a few
active players, but also to ensure more fun from playing with less
effort.
Tapforme
is a must if you:


are
	an active player, maybe even a part of a clan


want
	to get better results by fair means and less effort


play
	from time to time, just for fun


want
	to automate routine actions and get back to play when you are in the
	mood. Have more fun with your favorite parts of the game and spend
	less time on monotonous actions,
	such as farming for resources


have
	to balance between your interest in the game and your real life –
	school, work, friends and sleep


would let the app work while you are away


have
	a relative, friend or kid who likes playing games. Don’t judge,
	just give the app to this person and help him or her to find a
	trade-off between the game and social life.


Have
you already heard an amazing story about the friendship between a boy
and a programmer in our video? This is one of things we are extremely
proud of. Tapforme is not only a dedicated tool for active players,
but it is also a social instrument. Some
people think of playing online mobile games as of a bad thing
– parents get angry with their kids, students play truant,
people are late to meetings and all of them don’t have enough
sleep.
We
don’t want to stand in the way of progress. Instead of judgement
and criticism,
we want to streamline the process and make games more convenient and
less time-consuming. Reconciling your interest in the game and your
real life is much more efficient than spending hours on resource

ZNAF is a 4 player co-op game which breaks the cross platform barrier - you can play on any developed game console with a friend on any other console regardless of brand type. Along with PC and MAC, this brings console and PC/MAC players together! We are also releasing for iPhones, Androids, iPads, and Tablets. iPhone and Android players will be able to play together along with iPad and Tablet users.  ZNAF will be localized to the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Brazilian, Japanese,Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, and open to others.
Pretty revolutionary huh? Our goal at 40APM Studios is to break down gaming console barriers with fun, enjoyable, affordable, games.
ZNAF - Cross Platform Zombie GameZNAF has been in development since 2012, and currently is on hold due to lack of funding. We are very close to having a playable alpha version ready for release within weeks of our Indiegogo campaign.
ZNAF will require six months to finish, for all platforms. Along with development costs are licensing costs, to license with the major consoles (XBox 360, Playstation 3, and Nintendo Wii).
We will be marketing on television, online, and in magazines.
Supporting ZNAF isn't just about helping another game come to life - it's about changing the current standard in the gaming industry. Show game makers around the world we'd like the standard to be cross platform capable games.

After humanity has been polluting for decades, the world is in chaos. Where only one wizard can clean up the planet.


On a planet where toxic waste tends to spread. Garbage is granted life and become creatures known as Dumplings. A grumpy old wizard named Tobias resides in isolation, deep in an unknown forest inside of his castle. Until one day unwelcome d Dumplings arrive at his castle. Dragging him into a battle where he is forced to save the planet or suffer from Dumpling invaders. 


Grow A Pear is a indie game company that not only wants to make amazing games, that bring people joy, but hopefully make an impact on the planet by adding serious messages. A Wizard's Wasteland is being created so that people find a character that they can relate themselves to. People including myself can be selfish and careless about real issues, until they are personally affected.
We hope to deliver a heartfelt message with this game.The planet may not be overrun by garbage monsters, but it is important to maintain and keep our planet clean and safe.


Game Play and Mechanics

Risks & Challenges
Game was originally started in UDK, but thanks to Unreal's continuation of making a great engine. We have started over in Unreal 4, the results have been promising thus far. 

The following is a dubbed and rough cut of the UDK verison we were originally using.

We have really spent a lot of time and money to be 
able to make a game that we hope will make an impact. We believe in it and would not be asking for your assistance if we did not.
This biggest challenge might be having a successful Indiegogo. In reality you have nothing to lose if you enjoy playing games, because this game will be just as fulfilling as any game you have ever played. The only thing you have to lose out on, is an opportunity to be first to get your copy of A Wizard's Wasteland game.

<p>Atakapu is a 2.5D speedrun oriented platformer videogame. The main gameplay is based on a switch wich allows you to choose between different costumes that will give you special abilities. For the moment, there are two types of gameplays: the Agility and the Attack mode. The concept of our game will be to switch gameplays during the game so that at anytime to can adapt to the environment, platforms and enemies you encounter.</p>
<p>The goal of every level is to finish as fast as possible with the maximum of orbs that give you points.</p>

Now they are after you and will try to stop you by any means they have in their possession. Luckily for you, you also have some great weapons on your side as your costumes and abilities!

After travelling for years in the intergalactic space, his spaceship run out of fuel and crashed on a strange and wild planet named Kapiata where a wild and primitive tribe lives, the Atakapus. This planet turns to be as dangereous as its habitants and many dangers are hidden in the shadow of the Kapu Mont, a colossal volcano.
Gédéon will be to collect atomic fuel and pieces to fix his ship in order to quickly escape to find a safer place to live.





Atakapu is a 2.5D speedrun oriented platformer videogame. The main gameplay is based on a switch wich allows you to choose between different costumes that will give you special abilities. For the moment, there are two types of gameplays: the Agility and the Attack mode. The concept of our game will be to switch gameplays during the game so that at anytime to can adapt to the environment, platforms and enemies you encounter.
The goal of every level is to finish as fast as possible with the maximum of orbs that give you points.








At the begining of the game , Gedeon has no costume and he can only do single jumps.












After you have passed the level 1, you will unlock the agility costume for Gedeon and you can now play him from level 2.











The next costume that you will unlock is the attack costume.









Take note that if you are in agility mode, you can wall jump, double jump and grapple but you can't attack or dash enemies. In the same way , if you are on attack mode, you can't use abilities from agility mode. The timing of the switch will be important in certain situation to obtain the best time and score !










* One of our ideas is to create creature levels in which you'll be able to ride a cute creature and rush levels specially made for it.




We dream and wish to continue our project and launch our first game. We need your help to achieve this project. We truly believe in Atakapu! This project is our baby and we will raise it until it will become a fully grown up video game! And it will be so much cooler if you all help us and show us your support! 






































At this time of the development we already have 3 playable levels with online scoring. We already implemented the agility costume wich is fully functional except for the grapple wich still need some tweaking on the code. Right now we are focusing on the improvement of the attack costume, on new gameplay mechanics, on solving the bugs and on graphics.  









The planet Kapiata where our main character crashed is actually our level selection menu. There you have the possibility to see the top 3 of each level (on the right), your better score (on the left) as well as the switch mode to get to the ""time attack"" mode and an access to the general ranking ( Y or R).



As you can see on the top of the selection level menu we already implemented two different game modes so there will be two general ranking, one for each mode.
                       


On the Normal Mode the score is based on your time and the amount of orbs you collected.
On the Attack Mode you score is only based on your timing so hurry up!

Once you have finished one level on normal mode, you will automatically unlock the time attack mode as well as the normal mode for the next level.
For our main menu we decided to bring out the magical ambiance of the planet Kapiata and to allow the players to see all the 2 main characters of Atakapu and all the costumes in one place.






The level design has been made and thought for a speedrun and dynamic gameplay. You will need to be accurate on you jumps, double jumps, walljumps, attacks and dashes to save a few seconds and beat your friends score!
We would also like to make an addition to the HUD and create a complementary pannel wich will show you if you are winning or loosing time compared to your best time.  It's a common thing to see in speedrunner or racing game and we think it might be great for you to see your progression in game.








Haaaaa! We finally can introduce you to the Atakapus! Those little creatures live on Kapiata the planet where our main characer crashed. The Atakapu's are not really friendly with strangers and might even be dangereous for anyone coming from an other world. Too bad for you! Now they are after you and will try to stop you by any means they have in their possession. Luckily for you, you also have some great weapons on your side as your costumes and abilities! You will be able to fight back or even dodge their attacks if there is too many of them!
At this time of the development we already have two versions of the Atakapus:
The Range Atakapu: This one uses his blowpipe to throw poisoned projectile at you!
The Melee Atakapu: This one charges you and tries to kill you with his spear!














We would like to had some levels with bosses. We already did some graphic and gameplay researches. One of the sketches that we made has been selected and here is our first boss project. He is not in the game yet but he will be with your help!
This boss is a lava creature who has been tamed by Atakapus and who will fight for them to protect their planet. He is gigantic and has large paws that you will need to avoid if you don't want to die in horrible pain. He also has large spine and tail spikes and will use them to hit and hurt you. We don't know yet but he also might be able to spit fire like dragons. 
Those attacks are just ideas at this time and we still have plenty others to make our game even cooler! 






We are constantly searching for new graphic ideas. Here are some researches that uour concept artist made for the first levels.














We have some great ideas for the future of the game. Here are some of them:We would like to create an aquatic costume which will give us the opportunity to make underwater levels. This costume might be an other version of the attatck costume and will allow you to dash and throw bubbles at new ennemies.We also thought about adding a ghost of your best time in game. This will help you to know where to go and how to save time compared to your past times.An other idea is to create creature levels in which you'll be able to ride a cute creature and run levels specially made for it.There is also a project to create an infinite level in the great volcano, Kappu Mont, where you will need all of your strenght to go as far as you can.


The first challenge encountered is that we are unknow from video game industry and therefore we don't have a big community behing us to follow and share our game. We are currently working on our communication and to continue to expand our community.
An other challenge is that we are trying to make rich 3D environment while our gameplay is only 2D by adding depth to our scene. It demands to spend more time on the creation of each new level because we pay attention to every details of our environment. We already have good feedbacks for the graphics in our game and are proud to offer enhanced environment.
We are a young belgian indie team who just graduated from a graphic design school specialized in video games and located in Namur, Belgium. We are actually creating a video game in a team of 5 under the name ""FrostyFroggs"".Our game ""Atakapu"" was our final school project and right after being graduated we decided to continue and try our dream come true: make a video game and create fun!Our team is composed of 1 developer and 4 artists.It's our first project together and we are thrilled to share it with you guys!

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Alex. I am 17 years old and I live in Las Vegas, Nevada. My Co-Owner Seth, 17, lives in California. We have never met, but we have been friends online for almost seven years. Early January we began a website called Social Meeps where you could create a <strong>meep</strong>, a meep is a blob with a face you can decorate with hats. Social Meeps has a wide variety catalog with different variety of faces, bodies, and accessories for your meep.</p>
<p>Social Meeps first started as a simple chat room, until mid may when we began a multiplayer hangout game, similar to those of the Disney game Club Penguin - as you roll around and chat with friends or make some new ones. The community of Social Meeps is very small, allowing you to get to know the community a lot better.</p>
<h3>Why do we need funding?</h3>
<p>The issue we are having with Social Meeps is, of course, advertising. We want to get the word of Social Meeps out to the public, and to do that of course is to find a source of funding. There have been over 4,000 accounts made on Social Meeps so far, but we want to get the word out there on advertising services like Google Adwords and Adbrite to bring in more kids and have our community grow.</p>
<h3>What are the perks?</h3>
<p>You will be able to see all the perks, depending on how much you donate, on the right. If you purchase a something as small at the Being Awesome perk, you're just awesome and amazing for taking the time to donate. However, purchasing a larger perk will give you everything above it (including being awesome)!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The History of Social Meeps</h3>
<p><span>Social Meeps was originally founded by Seth. The site started out as he was developing his PHP and HTML skills on a simple website called Monster Planet. It didn't have a main purpose. Monster Planet had no actual users, but you could customize your character. Monster Planet's avatars used the same images as the current Social Meeps. Eventually, Seth decided to make a new website and start over as Monster Planet was becoming a rough draft. He moved on to a new website named Blob Universe, which still used the same avatar images. In Blob Universe, you could actually login, register, and communicate with other users. It had a light-blue and white color scheme and looked relatively professional. After Blob Universe became old, Seth moved on to another website named GyroPanda. The words ""gyro"" and ""panda"" were completely random and didn't have any relativity to the actual site. However, later he decided that the ""meeps"" should be called ""pandas"", even though they had no physical appearance that was relative to an actual panda. The site looked much more professional, and included a forum, status updates, profiles, a shop, and character customization. GyroPanda built up about 200 users. Seth decided that the site was becoming successful, and he purchased a paid-webhost with a .com domain. He moved GyroPanda to the new host and renamed the website to PandaFi. This site kept the same design as GyroPanda, but continued to progress and new features were built, such as a private-messaging system along with friend requests. The site eventually built up to about 400 users and became somewhat popular. Regardless of Seth's lack of motivation to work on the site, nobody complained for more, but this led to Seth going months without working on the site which led to it becaming extremely inactive. Seth decided that he didn't want a kid-based website, and he scratched the website and went to work on a more professional social-networking website such as Facebook or Google+. However, his lack-of-motivation led him to never start it. Months later, Alex missed PandaFi and had an extreme urge to bring it back to life. He bugged Seth to put the site back up for weeks. After Seth was tired of the nagging, he finally gave in and decided to put the website back up. There was a problem, though, in which Seth could not find the SQL database for the site, which led him to taking the site back down. This had Alex in frustration as he thought PandaFi was a great website and had much potential. With this motivation, Alex decided to put the website back up himself and completely overhaul it. One night, Alex chatted Seth to send him all the files of PandaFi so that he could bring it to life. Seth gave in and sent him the website the next morning. With Alex being a mediocre web developer, he didn't need Seth's code, so he coded his own. However, with Alex's lack of graphic design, he used Seth's graphics with his permission. Seth decided that he would help with the site by continuing to make assets, or hats and accessories to the site. Later, as Seth realized that Alex was building the website with his own images, he realized that the site was starting to look unprofessional. Seth forced Alex to use his images as he was disgusted by the pixelated-looking design. This new site started out of Alex's imgBomb server with the name ""GrassySpace"", but as the "".com"" domain was taken, Alex decided to rename it to Social Meeps. Social Meeps led Seth in awe as Alex made chats and other features in real-time with PubNub. Seth saw that the site was having lots of potential and decided he would help with graphics and administration. Alex made Seth co-owner. </span></p></div>","EDIT: Please read our rules for having your own content or putting your own content in the catalog here.

However, his lack-of-motivation led him to never start it. Months later, Alex missed PandaFi and had an extreme urge to bring it back to life. He bugged Seth to put the site back up for weeks. After Seth was tired of the nagging, he finally gave in and decided to put the website back up. There was a problem, though, in which Seth could not find the SQL database for the site, which led him to taking the site back down. This had Alex in frustration as he thought PandaFi was a great website and had much potential. With this motivation, Alex decided to put the website back up himself and completely overhaul it. One night, Alex chatted Seth to send him all the files of PandaFi so that he could bring it to life. Seth gave in and sent him the website the next morning. With Alex being a mediocre web developer, he didn't need Seth's code, so he coded his own. However, with Alex's lack of graphic design, he used Seth's graphics with his permission. Seth decided that he would help with the site by continuing to make assets, or hats and accessories to the site. Later, as Seth realized that Alex was building the website with his own images, he realized that the site was starting to look unprofessional. Seth forced Alex to use his images as he was disgusted by the pixelated-looking design. This new site started out of Alex's imgBomb server with the name ""GrassySpace"", but as the "".com"" domain was taken, Alex decided to rename it to Social Meeps. Social Meeps led Seth in awe as Alex made chats and other features in real-time with PubNub. Seth saw that the site was having lots of potential and decided he would help with graphics and administration. Alex made Seth co-owner.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We're a small little independent game developers based in the UK and US and by our powers combined we are Cap ... oh! Sorry! We're Fossil Games. Currently we are working our backsides off to create our first full length title, Camp Sunshine. We're all middle-aged and rather dull and like to spend our time in front of screens either doodling, coding, writing or coming up with ingenious little puzzles! </p>
<p>Camp Sunshine is now 'coming soon' on Steam! </p>
<p><a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/457570/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://store.steampowered.com/app/457570/</a></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fossilgames.com/igg/1.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>What Is Camp Sunshine?</h2>
<p>Camp Sunshine is our first full length game and sees you take on the role of Jez (or whatever you'd like to call him) as he gets dropped off at Summer Camp. He awakes in the middle of the night to find his camp deserted and covered in blood as the terrifying Isaac Illerman comes back from the dead to wreak his revenge against the campers!</p>
<p>You'll be able to explore the entire camp, from dorms and shacks to the head offices, counsellors quarters and lunch rooms as you piece together why Isaac is still at large and try to put an end to the bloodshed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fossilgames.com/igg/3.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As our ""hero"" Jez, you will be armed with your trusty flashlight. However, the batteries do run out so you'll need to explore the camp to find supplies, batteries, energy drinks, food and diary pages to unlock the hidden past!</p>
<p>The game is a homage to 16 bit RPG's from our youth, and our favourite genre too! We grew up watching Jason, Freddy, The Candyman and Hellraiser and want to create a game that proves that it's about the story and atmosphere rather than fancy graphics with trillions of polygons!</p>

<h3>Where The Money Will Go ...</h3>
<p>We became fully funded on the 8th of April 2016, thank you to everybody that donated to our project, we are amazed and humbled by your faith in our game. Camp Sunshine has now been marked as 'In Demand' and as such we can continue to raise money to make the game even better ... We raised a total of $1195, and this is going to be put towards the following ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom artwork for our cover!</li>
<li>Audio &amp; Dialogue Recording</li>
<li>Steam Greenlight Fees</li>
<li>Apple Developer Costs</li>
<li>Android Store Fees</li>
<li>A Little Bit of Marketing</li>

<p>The game is already well underway with the engine secure and our talented artist Josh beavering away creating awesome 16-bit sprites of people with their heads cut off and counsellors having ""fun"" in the woods.</p>

<p>SFU Servers is an upcoming Game Server and VoIP (voice over ip) Hosting Company.  The project has been in its planning stages for quite some time, but recently made the jump to actually push forward.  The website is still under development, but is rapidly approaching completion.  A dedicated server will be required to finish website configuration and needed for testing before launch.</p>
<p>Currently, sfuservers.com only shows a temporary page, but the development site can be found here: <a href=""http://dev.sfuservers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dev.sfuservers.com</a></p>
<p>Please note that Prices and Content are subject to change before the website officially launches.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us via our facebook page, or through the contact form on the development website.</p>
<p>At Launch, we plan to offer the following services for rental:</p>
<p> <strong>Game Servers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ARMA II</li>
<li>Counter-Strike</li>
<li>Counter-Strike: Condition Zero</li>
<li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</li>
<li>Counter-Strike: Source</li>
<li>DayZ</li>
<li>Garry's Mod</li>
<li>Left 4 Dead</li>

<ul>
<li>ARMA III</li>
<li>Cube World</li>
<li>Team Speak 3</li>
<li>Ventrilo</li>
</ul><p>We will be adding more services, these are only examples.  Services added will also be based on customer feedback and upcoming game popularity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sfuservers.com/indiegogo/funding.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Currently, we have registered two domains for SFU Servers:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.sfuservers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sfuservers.com</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.sfuservers.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sfuservers.net</a></p>
<p>The webhosting has been paid for a year in advance. The website is hosted seperately from the game servers and game/voice server control panel to avoid any security threats that may occur in the future.</p>
<p>Right now, we are seeking the funds necessary to rent our first dedicated server at a datacenter in Buffalo, New York.  The amount that we are shooting for on indiegogo will cover approximately a year.  If things go well, we will be acquiring additional servers across the United States, and plan on expanding into overseas territory at a later date once the company takes off.</p>
<p>We are estimating 2-3 weeks to finish server/website configuration before the website actually goes live.  We are extremely passionate about this project and are really pushing to succeed!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sfuservers.com/indiegogo/whysfu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After doing a lot of research regarding Game Hosting Companies, it seems like a lot of them are run by younger individuals, and not always taken seriously.  With this, you sometimes get the occassional unprofessional attitude and lack of or delayed support.</p>
<p>SFU Servers will be run by responsible adults, with too much time on their hands, with a passion for gaming!</p>
<p>Aside from our excellent customer support, we will also offer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Contracts</li>
<li>No Server Branding</li>
<li>Mod Support</li>
<li>TCAdmin</li>
<li>Automatic Re-Installations</li>
<li>Log Files</li>
<li>FTP Access</li>
<li>No Setup Fees</li>
<li>3 Day Money Back Guarantee</li>

Cube World
Team Speak 3
Ventrilo
We will be adding more services, these are only examples.  Services added will also be based on customer feedback and upcoming game popularity.
 

Currently, we have registered two domains for SFU Servers:
sfuservers.com
sfuservers.net
The webhosting has been paid for a year in advance. The website is hosted seperately from the game servers and game/voice server control panel to avoid any security threats that may occur in the future.
Right now, we are seeking the funds necessary to rent our first dedicated server at a datacenter in Buffalo, New York.  The amount that we are shooting for on indiegogo will cover approximately a year.  If things go well, we will be acquiring additional servers across the United States, and plan on expanding into overseas territory at a later date once the company takes off.
We are estimating 2-3 weeks to finish server/website configuration before the website actually goes live.  We are extremely passionate about this project and are really pushing to succeed!
 

After doing a lot of research regarding Game Hosting Companies, it seems like a lot of them are run by younger individuals, and not always taken seriously.  With this, you sometimes get the occassional unprofessional attitude and lack of or delayed support.
SFU Servers will be run by responsible adults, with too much time on their hands, with a passion for gaming!
Aside from our excellent customer support, we will also offer the following:

No Contracts
No Server Branding
Mod Support
TCAdmin
Automatic Re-Installations
Log Files
FTP Access
No Setup Fees
3 Day Money Back Guarantee
More details can be found on the development website.
 

All contributors will receive the Thank You Perk.  Also, please note that these are different levels, and will not work backwards.  
Example: If you contribute to the Tier 3 Perk, you DO NOT also receive the Tier 1 and Tier 2 Perks.  Only the Tier 3 Perk and the Thank You Perk.
 

We understand that not everyone has the money to contribute to our cause, but if you like what we are trying to accomplish, please feel free to spread the word about the project!  Every little bit helps us out!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Once upon a time, five friends were at a bar in Buenos Aires shouting out random scenarios then posing outrageously and laughing hysterically. One friend suggested that this would be a great mobile app. Five light bulbs went off and WePose was born!</p>
<p>After months of Skype calls, dirty jokes and startup sass, WePose is now ready to come out of the app closet. Why? So Posers around the world can experience just how fun taking photos can be. And, so the world can be little more awesome.</p>

<p>In this side-scrolling Action RPG, you take the role of a World Eater which
travels through The Void smashing and burrowing into unsuspecting worlds. There
you can: </p>
<ul>
<li>take control of a summoned Dragon which can be equipped and
     customized for maximum mayhem and destruction, </li>
<li>command minions to assassinate, pillage, spy and terraform, </li>
<li>defend against Settlement Armies, Thieves, Heroes and Slayers,</li>
<li>fight other dragons for supremacy and new abilities,</li>
<li>forge armors and abilities,</li>
<li>obliterate entire worlds on a whim,</li>
<li>and more....</li>
</ul>
<p>Experience a dynamic world where Settlements react to Dragon presence by: </p>
<ul>
<li>boosting each-other via Loot Caravans, </li>
<li>scouting around for Loot that may have been dropped by Dragons,</li>
<li>summoning Armies and Heroes to steal from the Dragon's Lair,</li>
<li>summoning Dragon Slayers to hunt down Dragons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experience the randomness of a world where biomes and their settlements,
settlement armies and their abilities, events and... pretty much everything
related to the world will be randomized on every new game.</p>
<p>This game lets you mod just about anything from how everything looks to what
everything uses to attack you with. </p>

<li>Steampunk Dragons? - no problem!</li>
<li>Units firing sheep as projectiles ? – done!</li>

<br/>This universe is populated by countless worlds teeming with life and a
seemingly infinite biome variety. </div>
<p>In what seems like an all you can eat buffet, space faring entities known
only as World Eaters travel from planet to planet in order to devour resources
and life force. They turn the life force into Domination Energy which they use
to summon Dragons as their heralds of doom. </p>
<p>These monumental creatures create their own twisted biome version which
they’ll imprint on a planet on impact. As the host planet gets progressively
terraformed so does the World Eater’s hold over the world’s resources and its
core. Once the world becomes devoid of life and resources, the World Eater
obliterates it before opening a Void Gate to its next meal.</p>
<p>Although capable of unimaginable destruction, they’re vulnerable to the
""insects"" that inhabit the worlds. The Settlers will rush to a World Eater’s core
to steal its life force which also happens to be a mountain of precious stones
and metals. To protect themselves, the World Eaters collect Dragon Cores which
they use to summon Dragons of different shapes, sizes and types.</p>
<p>They will act as Lairs for the summoned Dragons using excess resources to
build up a comfortable habitat for them, giving them access to Abilities,
Armors and Minions and providing them with healing and transportation.</p>
<p>When not on a world, Lairs will retreat in the Void where they can use
stored Domination Energy to forge new Abilities and Armor for Dragons and
fiddle with various settings of the Universe.</p><br/><p><br/></p>

and then can either steal valuable loot from the settlers to feed the Lair or
morph back into their Dragon form and rise up from the middle of the settlement
destroying structures in the process. 

<p>Their mere presence terraforms the land to a draconic landscape disrupting a
region’s income and their Call can command armies of minions to destroy or
infiltrate settlements, overrun or assassinate enemies, build defenses, recover
dropped treasures or permanently terraform regions.</p>
<p>Dragons have access to various facilities that allow them to dominate worlds
including the <b>Armor Forge</b>, <b>Ability Forge</b> and <b>Domination Engine</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The Armor Forge</b> will allow Dragons to fully customize
     their armor sets from how they look to what individual stats they have.
     The forged armors can be stored in the<b> Abyssal Armory</b> which will
     allow any Dragon to equip any available armor.</li>
<li>
<b>The Ability Forge</b> will allow Dragons to discover new
     abilities, upgrade them or fuse them together for more powerful effects.
     Similar to the Abyssal Armory, they can be stored in the <b>Abyssal
     Conflux</b> which will allow any Dragon to use any available ability.</li>
<li>
<b>The</b> <b>Domination Engine</b> will allow Dragons to
     create and customize their own <b>Domination Essence</b> - decaying
     power-ups that affect all available Dragons and their abilities. The
     Engine is powered by forged abilities whose levels affect the Domination Essence
     intensity.</li>

 a looted Dragon’s Lair. Searching to see if anything was left behind,

<p>Everyone on the team is excited to see a dynamic game where you can directly
control a Dragon and break worlds asunder as opposed to playing a game where
you just “have a Dragon in it” or even worse “it’s part of the backstory”. On
top of that we also wanted to create a unique universe where the Lair itself is
alive and where Dragons can be pretty much anything you imagined them to be
(Steampunk Dragons, Heavy Metal Rock Dragons, Sheep Dragons, you name it) and
can use about any attack you can think of (lasers, rockets, fireballs, whatever
you want really…) So far we’re proud of how flexible the game’s modding system
turned out.

</p>
<p>Unfortunately creating worlds takes a huge financial effort. Although our initial
backers valiantly supported the first stage of development, the wads of cash
needed to fuel the project can’t be reached without outside support.</p>
<p>If you want to see an awesome game like this out there and want to support a
company that will build loads of similarly unique games in the future, this is
where it all starts.</p>

<p>We need to raise enough cash to fund our experienced team to
do this proper. Although only a handful of projects dared to ask for this much
on Indiegogo we’re doing so with the knowledge that we aren’t only making a
game but a whole universe and a platform for modders to go wild in the Action
RPG genre. This means we’re building a whole new Action RPG system pretty much
from scratch which has to be flexible enough to support loads of content (both
official releases and modded) while maintaining its overall scope and feel (Dragon brawl mayhem).</p>
<p>A large portion of the features we’ve talked about on this
page have already been implemented and are working at code level but we need
funding if we are to actually use that code and build something fun and
playable around it.</p>
<p>We’ve already taken into account the possibility that we
can’t gather the whole sum needed to hit all our funding goals so we’ve made
them fairly flexible in nature allowing us to prioritize some before others in
case you guys feel something requires more urgency.</p>
<p>Your votes will matter in the development process and will
visibly impact what we’re touching on in each sprint so your money will be
spent on the features you want most.</p>

development. Fortunately in our 10+ year history we’ve created and shipped more
than 20 games on four different platforms so we have a pretty good grasp on how
long it takes to build a game of this magnitude. </p>
<p>Even though we took into account building most of the main features, as
their number grows so will the chance something goes wrong. We will however
provide you with milestone iterations which will ensure you have the latest
most polished content even after the release of the base package.</p>
<p>Besides, if any delays show up we can always slow down time around us so
everyone looking thinks we're working faster right ? RIGHT?</p>
<p><b>Feature Creep</b> - it’s a real challenge keeping this game on a
manageable scale especially since we want this project to have so much depth.
For this reason, the community will be the one voting on features and content
via a tiered forum system. Since this game is so player-centric we want the
very best gameplay experience and only players can tell us what they want their
Dragons to feel like.</p>
<p>The game features will be presented to backers as early as their concept
state. If a Cotton Candy Dragon that attacks using rainbow chairs ends up in
the game it’s all your fault! (the poptart cat laser, albeit a tad buggy, was
pretty fun when we tried it).</p>
<p><b>Community Content Distribution -</b> we need to build a community content
sharing system that allows players to exchange mods in a solid content
management environment. This will require a separate set of expenses and it’s
related to the company itself rather than the game. We have some idea as of how
we’ll manage this but we’re still searching for some cheaper alternatives that
allow our modders the freedom they deserve.</p>
<p><b>World Eater Landing -</b> we need to build a few more telescopes
specialized in scouting the Void for incoming World Eaters. If even one of them
manages to land of Earth, it’s pretty much the end of this project.</p>

</div></div>","In this side-scrolling Action RPG, you take the role of a World Eater which
travels through The Void smashing and burrowing into unsuspecting worlds. There
you can: 

take control of a summoned Dragon which can be equipped and
     customized for maximum mayhem and destruction, 
command minions to assassinate, pillage, spy and terraform, 
defend against Settlement Armies, Thieves, Heroes and Slayers,
fight other dragons for supremacy and new abilities,
forge armors and abilities,
obliterate entire worlds on a whim,
and more....

Experience a dynamic world where Settlements react to Dragon presence by: 

boosting each-other via Loot Caravans, 
scouting around for Loot that may have been dropped by Dragons,
summoning Armies and Heroes to steal from the Dragon's Lair,
summoning Dragon Slayers to hunt down Dragons.

Experience the randomness of a world where biomes and their settlements,
settlement armies and their abilities, events and... pretty much everything
related to the world will be randomized on every new game.
This game lets you mod just about anything from how everything looks to what
everything uses to attack you with. 

Steampunk Dragons? - no problem!
Units firing sheep as projectiles ? – done!
Biomes made of cake? - already there!


In this epic domination contest will you survive long enough to become Ruler of
The Void? 




This is the base game without any fancy depth of play


Your very own World Eater – complete with Dragon
     summoning rooms, Armor Forge, Ability Forge, Minion Dens, 
     customizable, upgradeable, able to travel through Void Portals and destroy
     worlds (batteries not included).

Your very own Dragons – Dragons, their abilities and
     armor - you name it, you can customize it.

Dynamic gameplay – Because dodging enemy attacks should
     be the norm.

Persistent metagame – What you build is yours to keep.

Persistent in-game rewards transferred to the metagame –
     You only need to earn them once,

Procedurally generated worlds - To infinity and beyond!

Summon minions to do your bidding – It’s not domination
     unless you command an endless horde of minions.

An extremely moddable and customizable framework –
     because the devs never know what the game is supposed to be like.






For when a rampaging Dragon doesn't seem to work all that
well... 

Make minions more important by adding up to 12
     sub-specializations for the Dragon's Lair.
Will increase the number of rooms available to build minions
     in.
Minions will gain new abilities.
Minions will be able to equip gear.
Modders will be able to fiddle around with the minions.






Because not going out of your way to help those hobbits find
their way to Isengard while everyone wants to kill you is inexcusable 

we'll implement a challenge system that ties in with metagame
     rewards.
we'll create a pool of challenges that will get randomized on
     each new world.
modders will be able to fiddle around and create their own
     challenges.








Domination Spree, Abyssal Storm or Meltdown are only a few of the epic
sounding names describing equally epic game modes.

we'll implement a game mode system that ties in with metagame
     rewards.
these will offer various challenges that break away from the
     normal gameplay (see below).
modders will be able to fiddle around and create their own game
     mode variations.








Achievements will reward excellence with more than “just a badge”,

we'll implement an achievement system that rewards players with
     useful and unique Armor Sets, Abilities and Dragons.
in a complete twist on game development you will have to
     actually Earn these unlike you would in most games...
These achievements will also be tied to Steam's system allowing
     you to rack up those points.








Because what's the point of playing solo when you can dominate worlds with
your friends in PvP or Team PvP,

we'll create the multiplayer mode allowing players to connect
     and play with each-other.
modders will be able to show off their stuff to other players.
we'll hire people to patch something up for this.
we'll make a multiplayer support department.



For when casual slaughter isn't enough.... 


we'll build a competitive multiplayer platform.
we'll build a solid ranking system.
Dragons will gain the Shapeshifting ability allowing for a more
     stealthy approach when facing a more powerful opponent.
we'll build a Domination Engine that further empowers your
     Dragon's destructive abilities.
we'll build a solid matchmaking system for competitive play.
We’ll build an in-game trade market for Abilities, Dragon Cores
     Armor Blueprints and Materials.
we'll hire people that actually know what they're doing.
we'll hire more people in the support department that you can
     blame for random things.








For who wants to enjoy the same experience on different devices
we'll start making versions for other platforms depending on
     demand.  



This universe is populated by countless worlds teeming with life and a
seemingly infinite biome variety. 
In what seems like an all you can eat buffet, space faring entities known
only as World Eaters travel from planet to planet in order to devour resources
and life force. They turn the life force into Domination Energy which they use
to summon Dragons as their heralds of doom. 
These monumental creatures create their own twisted biome version which
they’ll imprint on a planet on impact. As the host planet gets progressively
terraformed so does the World Eater’s hold over the world’s resources and its
core. Once the world becomes devoid of life and resources, the World Eater
obliterates it before opening a Void Gate to its next meal.
Although capable of unimaginable destruction, they’re vulnerable to the
""insects"" that inhabit the worlds. The Settlers will rush to a World Eater’s core
to steal its life force which also happens to be a mountain of precious stones
and metals. To protect themselves, the World Eaters collect Dragon Cores which
they use to summon Dragons of different shapes, sizes and types.
They will act as Lairs for the summoned Dragons using excess resources to
build up a comfortable habitat for them, giving them access to Abilities,
Armors and Minions and providing them with healing and transportation.
When not on a world, Lairs will retreat in the Void where they can use
stored Domination Energy to forge new Abilities and Armor for Dragons and
fiddle with various settings of the Universe.




Masters of shapeshifting, Dragons can infiltrate settlements
and then can either steal valuable loot from the settlers to feed the Lair or
morph back into their Dragon form and rise up from the middle of the settlement
destroying structures in the process. 

Their mere presence terraforms the land to a draconic landscape disrupting a
region’s income and their Call can command armies of minions to destroy or
infiltrate settlements, overrun or assassinate enemies, build defenses, recover
dropped treasures or permanently terraform regions.
Dragons have access to various facilities that allow them to dominate worlds
including the Armor Forge, Ability Forge and Domination Engine.


The Armor Forge will allow Dragons to fully customize
     their armor sets from how they look to what individual stats they have.
     The forged armors can be stored in the Abyssal Armory which will
     allow any Dragon to equip any available armor.

The Ability Forge will allow Dragons to discover new
     abilities, upgrade them or fuse them together for more powerful effects.
     Similar to the Abyssal Armory, they can be stored in the Abyssal
     Conflux which will allow any Dragon to use any available ability.

The Domination Engine will allow Dragons to
     create and customize their own Domination Essence - decaying
     power-ups that affect all available Dragons and their abilities. The
     Engine is powered by forged abilities whose levels affect the Domination Essence
     intensity.

World Eaters can gain new Dragon Cores by defeating other World Eaters. Each
Dragon having unique traits and visuals.





Harvesting the Void’s sounds, World Eaters can create the 
Heavy Metal Dragon Core. Although they live in the Void, creating a 
Heavy Metal Dragon Core is not an easy task requiring a lot of 
Domination Energy. Few worlds have heard the song of the Void and fewer still have lived to tell the tale.

It’s unknown where World Eaters go to find the Dragon Cores that spawn 
Clockwork Dragons. These are a World Eater’s pride and joy and no true 
Dragon Core collector would be seen without one.
								It is said that whenever attacking one of these Dragons time 
seems to slow down or even stop in their immediate vicinity making them 
nearly impossible to hit with normal projectiles. 


No Dragon is as elusive as the Steam Dragon and keeping one summoned is a
 World Eater’s way to boast about its seemingly endless supply of 
Domination Energy. Due to its ethereal nature, the Dragon’s shape can 
only be maintained using a highly pressurized metal body.
								
Seemingly immortal, this Dragon can only be defeated by severely damaging its container, forcing the creature to dissipate.

The local settlers are none too happy about their Dragon
neighbors. In preparation for the encounter, they will start gathering
resources, help each-other grow by sending Loot Caravans from
one-another and will send Thieves to loot the nearby Dragon Lairs. 

Once their wealth allows it, they’ll be able to summon Hero Parties, Armies
or even Dragon Slayers. The Thieves Guild will make its services
available for the Settlers allowing them to send Thieves to stealthily
steal from the Dragon’s Lair.


Hero Parties drawn by the sense of adventure,
     seeking fame and fortune or simply being forced into it by peer pressure,
     will warp onto the Dragon’s world in an attempt to loot or even slay the
     “World Eater”.

Armies are summoned forth by settlements to destroy the
     Dragon’s Lair and loot it. The army ranks are filled with all sorts of the
     oddities from the Greed Plane which will do anything for the promise of
     loot, even raiding a Dragon’s Lair.

Dragon Slayers are the ultimate combat summons which
     will actively seek out and hunt Dragons, empowering all Armies and Hero
     Parties in the process.

The Dragon’s hoard size will attract more and more unwanted attention from
Thieves, Hero Parties, Armies and Dragon Slayers. 



Occasionally players may find that other Dragons inhabit the same planet and
they will have to use all their strength to defeat these foes; the prize being
new abilities which they can upgrade to deal more damage and to have new
effects added. 

The encounters will be fast paced and dynamic allowing dragons to use up to
4 types of abilities of 3 varying intensities with just a click of the mouse.
The combat system favors and rewards good aim more than blind attack spam.
Incoming attacks can either be avoided by quickly dashing out of the way or
straight up tanked using a defensive ability or carefully crafted armor.
Settlements will protect themselves using various abilities similar to a
Dragon’s so players should be prepared for a world of hurt when deciding
whether or not to attack a seemingly harmless village of laser cannon
enthusiasts.
Enemies that cannot defeat a Dragon will not engage in pointless fights,
instead they’ll focus on stealing the dragon’s hoard faster. They will however
be equipped with abilities which will severely cripple an overconfident Dragon.
Stealing from the Dragons and giving to themselves, the Champions of
Justice will relentlessly… rob Dragons blind every time they get the
chance. They will be tough opponents bent on emptying the Dragon’s coffers as
fast as they can. Wielding powerful abilities they’re not easy to defeat (for
all the wrong reasons).
Specialized Dragon Slayers will relentlessly hunt down Dragons using
exotic abilities and their presence will boost the morale of all other enemies.







After stumbling over a World Eater’s remains he went inside only to find
 a looted Dragon’s Lair. Searching to see if anything was left behind, 
he found a nearly perfect sphere made of rock near a runed pedestal. 
Grabbing the rock made it glow and almost instantly a portal opened up 
above and a giant World Clutcher claw came down pulling him into the 
Void of the World Eaters. 
									Story goes that the same kind of portal opens every time the world is 
threatened by World Eaters. A creature made of Domination Energy emerges
 from the portal bearing a World Clutcher claw for an arm and 
relentlessly chases down the Dragons killing them with strange magic and
 stealing their energy.




The search for knowledge and the truth of his world led him into the 
depths of a dead World Eater. Even after hundreds of years since the 
World Eater’s demise, Domination Energy filled the air making a dense 
poisonous fog. Denser still was the fog around the now empty hoard 
chamber in which the gold used to reside. The goal of this intrusion 
however wasn’t the fortune but the countless runes that seemed to be on 
every wall. One wall in particular stood out which seemed to have runes 
glow whenever a bag of gold was nearby.
									Eons passed since discovering the wall’s secret and Jar’Edo is still 
alive showing up whenever a World Eater appears. Using his knowledge of 
the Void he hunts down Dragons to feed his books and to quench his 
endless thirst of knowledge and power.


Occasional Mysterious Traders will appear offering resources,
abilities and a safe haven for Dragons. Settlements however strongly believe
that Dragon Traders ruin the neighborhood and they will dispatch punitive
forces to swiftly deal with the undesirables.

Settlements will send Caravans to boost each-other’s economy or to
save their fortune in case they’re facing certain doom.
Random Encounters will have Dragons engage in various challenge
events.




World Eaters can choose to change planets at any time destroying the current
one in the process. Each new planetary impact will result in the seamless
procedural generation of a whole world.

World Eaters get to choose their next collision course influencing what
planet they’re going to hit on their next milestone:


Tame World – a small world where wounded World Eaters
     can feed off to regain some of the lost hoard.

Balanced World – a medium-sized world where players can
     find moderate challenge and a moderate supply of loot to increase their
     Dragon’s hoard.

Raging World – a large world where players get to fend
     off powerful armies and conquer large settlements to gain ability
     experience, armor materials and hoard.

Dragon World – players get to fight NPC Dragons to gain
     new abilities.

Nemesis World - multiplayer vs battle.

Planet collisions will not affect the Lair – carrying over any and all
changes made to it. It will however kill the minions.






Each time World Eaters land on a planet, a random list of Dynamic Challenges
will be given, which Dragons have to go out of their way to complete.
Challenges will offer various rewards which range from Domination Energy to
Armor Set pieces and blueprints.


Take the Hobbits to Isengard - even after all this time
     Hobbits need be taken to Isengard...

Zombie Plants vs Dragons- when a Necroplanter starts
     raising undead plants, only a Dragon can root out this evil (it's pretty
     corny we know...)

Eat the Cloudtart - some clouds are just begging to be
     eaten. Catching this fast food will be a challenge however...

Game modes feature some fast paced worlds with different
rule sets. Each game mode will offer increasingly better rewards as the players
advance through the game. 



Domination Spree – is a mode in which the Dragons have
     to destroy small worlds increasingly faster to satiate the Lair’s hunger.

Abyssal Storm – is a mode in which Lair Seeds will
     constantly fall from the sky replacing defeated Lairs creating a proving
     ground.

Meltdown – is a mode in which the world’s volcanos are
     unstable creating dangerous fire rains all around the planet.
And more…







Everyone on the team is excited to see a dynamic game where you can directly
control a Dragon and break worlds asunder as opposed to playing a game where
you just “have a Dragon in it” or even worse “it’s part of the backstory”. On
top of that we also wanted to create a unique universe where the Lair itself is
alive and where Dragons can be pretty much anything you imagined them to be
(Steampunk Dragons, Heavy Metal Rock Dragons, Sheep Dragons, you name it) and
can use about any attack you can think of (lasers, rockets, fireballs, whatever
you want really…) So far we’re proud of how flexible the game’s modding system
turned out.


Unfortunately creating worlds takes a huge financial effort. Although our initial
backers valiantly supported the first stage of development, the wads of cash
needed to fuel the project can’t be reached without outside support.
If you want to see an awesome game like this out there and want to support a
company that will build loads of similarly unique games in the future, this is
where it all starts.




We need to raise enough cash to fund our experienced team to
do this proper. Although only a handful of projects dared to ask for this much
on Indiegogo we’re doing so with the knowledge that we aren’t only making a
game but a whole universe and a platform for modders to go wild in the Action
RPG genre. This means we’re building a whole new Action RPG system pretty much
from scratch which has to be flexible enough to support loads of content (both
official releases and modded) while maintaining its overall scope and feel (Dragon brawl mayhem).
A large portion of the features we’ve talked about on this
page have already been implemented and are working at code level but we need
funding if we are to actually use that code and build something fun and
playable around it.
We’ve already taken into account the possibility that we
can’t gather the whole sum needed to hit all our funding goals so we’ve made
them fairly flexible in nature allowing us to prioritize some before others in
case you guys feel something requires more urgency.
Your votes will matter in the development process and will
visibly impact what we’re touching on in each sprint so your money will be
spent on the features you want most.




We are an international team of veterans that hail from
Ubisoft, EA, Namco, Sega and Sierra. We worked on project-relevant titles like Crash Bandicoot series, The Legend of Spyro series, Soul Calibur
series and a bunch of other games from which our experience may or may not come
in handy such as Final Fantasy series,
Crystal Defenders, Puzzle Quest 2, Rolling with Katamari, The
Incredible Machine, Delta Force,
Bourne Conspiracy, Silent Hunter series,
Chess Master series, Medal of Honor, Red Alert, and more…














Unexpected Delays - these are pretty much the norm in game
development. Fortunately in our 10+ year history we’ve created and shipped more
than 20 games on four different platforms so we have a pretty good grasp on how
long it takes to build a game of this magnitude. 
Even though we took into account building most of the main features, as
their number grows so will the chance something goes wrong. We will however
provide you with milestone iterations which will ensure you have the latest
most polished content even after the release of the base package.
Besides, if any delays show up we can always slow down time around us so
everyone looking thinks we're working faster right ? RIGHT?
Feature Creep - it’s a real challenge keeping this game on a
manageable scale especially since we want this project to have so much depth.
For this reason, the community will be the one voting on features and content
via a tiered forum system. Since this game is so player-centric we want the
very best gameplay experience and only players can tell us what they want their
Dragons to feel like.
The game features will be presented to backers as early as their concept
state. If a Cotton Candy Dragon that attacks using rainbow chairs ends up in
the game it’s all your fault! (the poptart cat laser, albeit a tad buggy, was
pretty fun when we tried it).
Community Content Distribution - we need to build a community content
sharing system that allows players to exchange mods in a solid content
management environment. This will require a separate set of expenses and it’s
related to the company itself rather than the game. We have some idea as of how
we’ll manage this but we’re still searching for some cheaper alternatives that
allow our modders the freedom they deserve.
World Eater Landing - we need to build a few more telescopes
specialized in scouting the Void for incoming World Eaters. If even one of them
manages to land of Earth, it’s pretty much the end of this project.

Games like this will be probabily militestone for Oculus Rift and this kind of game are going to be the game with more impact in the Virtual Reality world. The most exciting thing to see in virtual world,before to FPS games,before to Horror games,before to Simulation games, is the BEATIFUL places can be created in VR(Virtual Reality).The most beatiful places in games are in exploration and adventure games,because a lot of attention of details is dedicated to the environment.And how beatiful can be to see something with your eyes inside the Oculus rift,when the environment and places are REALLY well done? Oh well..you have only to discover it!
Like we have said before,the game is not only an ideas,we have a Demo available on the Official forum of Oculus

<h3><font color=""#cc0000"">Who are we?</font></h3>
<p>We're a group of video game developers located in beautiful Orlando, Florida.  Members of our team have degrees in Business Administration, Digital Media, and Information Technology, as well as Master's degrees in Interactive Entertainment from the University of Central Florida. We've had experience working in the industry as part of a larger company, but the lack of quality Christian-themed games has inspired us to step up to the plate.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><font color=""#cc0000"">Where can you find us?</font></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We're trying to build a strong Internet presence with many different ways for you to find us. So, naturally we turned to social networking.  We can be found on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/cohortmedia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Cohort Media on Facebook"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://gplus.to/cohortmedia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Cohort Media on Google Plus"">Google Plus</a>, and <a href=""http://twitter.com/#%21/cohortmedia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Cohort Media on Twitter"">Twitter</a>, and will be updating our pages as often as possible.  Bear with us if we're a tad slow, we all have other full-time jobs at the moment!  A quick search for Cohort Media on any of those sites should find us, So look us up and drop us a line.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We also have a standard website with a bit more information about us.  You can find it at <a href=""http://www.cohortmedia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">http://www.cohortmedia.com</a><a rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""></a><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><font color=""#cc0000"">What are we going to do?</font></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our plan is to provide Christian-themed games for a variety of platforms and audiences. Hundreds of millions of people are playing games on their phones, on Facebook, and on their computers, but the vast majority of games have nothing to do with Christianity.  Now, don't get us wrong.  We love video games as they are now, but we'd like for there to be fun, polished, Christian alternatives to be enjoyed.  There are 2 main audiences we'd like the opportunity to target:  Christian families with children and those who have not yet found a relationship with Christ.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Anytime you go to a restaurant (or maybe even church!), you'll see children playing games on their parents' cell phones.  This ""restaurant effect"" provides a terrific opportunity for children to learn more about Christ and his teachings, while enjoying an entertaining game that parents know is safe for their age.  Children are inquisitive, and we'd love them to be asking their families about Noah and his ark instead of which gun deals the most damage.  To that end, we'd also include a special ""Parent's Corner"" with all our children's games, giving parents some insight on what we're teaching, where they can find it in the Bible, and some hints about the game (after all, you need to be able to show your kids how to play!)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our second audience, the non-Christian, is a bit trickier to reach but just as important, if not more important.  There are plenty of reasons why someone may not be a Christian, and we understand that. But a few of those reasons can be helped.  Let's face it, going to a church for the first time can be intimidating.  You're in a room filled with people you may not know, talking about stories you've never heard, and you don't know the words to any of the songs.  Even opening the Bible for the first time is a daunting experience, and enough to overwhelm some. With video games, we're able to present all the great stories of the Bible in a low stress, familiar environment, and in a format that many people are comfortable with.  Our goal is to reduce the barriers to entry for those non-Christians, and open the doors in a way that they can learn and grow without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font color=""#cc0000"">Who are we going to impact?</font></h3>
<p>As of October 2011, over 250 million iOS devices (iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads) have been sold worldwide.  Similarly, over 180 million Android devices have been sold, with another 700,000 being activated every day.  If you add in the over 800 million Facebook users, there is a tremendous number of people we could reach with our products.  Millions of gamers every day are gathering together and talking about the latest games, and we'd love to have that audience talking about Christ and his teachings.  If we were able to reach even 1% of our potential market, we'd have a chance to minister to over 12 million people. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><font color=""#cc0000"">What are we asking for?</font></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We're asking for pledges, donations, and other financial contributions to help get our studio started.  To get us off the ground for a year of operations, we're asking for $685,000.00 USD. That's a pretty significant amount, certainly larger than most other fundraising campaigns on this site, but it's also a value that we believe to be in reach.  If we can get 1% of the Christians in the United States to donate 1 dollar, we could raise over $1.2 million.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We're offering some pretty neat perks for your contributions at certain dollar amounts, and depending on your feedback, we can adjust the values to provide our supporters with items that interest you more directly.  Since every dollar helps, feel free to donate a dollar amount different than any of the values we presented. We have until Good Friday to try and raise our funds, so even if you can only pledge one dollar, it's a huge help.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you can contribute other services in lieu of a financial donation, such as office space or legal counsel, please contact us and we'd be more than happy to chat with you. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><font color=""#cc0000"">The ""Campaign Game""</font></h3>
<div>We haven't spoken about any specific game projects yet, and there's a reason.  Every perk over $50 includes an ""Executive Vote"" to help decide which game project we develop first. We have four projects in mind, and we'll steadily release information about them over the course of the campaign.  Every week, we'll be releasing clues and hints about one of the projects.  Here's where the ""Campaign Game"" comes in.  If our donors can get us to certain milestones quick enough, we'll stop teasing and spill the beans early.  Here are the four thresholds:<font color=""#cc0000""><br/><br/></font>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$125,000</span> by January 31</li>

<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$600,000</span> by March 25</li>
</ul>
<div>
<br/>As you can see, the goals are high and the time is short. So tell all your friends and help reveal the projects! Also, we'll have a special prize for the donor whose pledge actually crosses the barrier.</div>

<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font color=""#cc0000"">Where will your dollars go?</font></h3>
<p>Well, it's no secret that we're asking for a substantial amount of capital.  To find that large, large number, we have the following considerations:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Legal Expenses</b></li>
<ul><li>Forming a business isn't always easy, and we'd like to make sure we have all our ducks in a row.  Solid legal counsel in the beginning can go a long way.</li></ul>
<li><b>Salaries</b></li>
<ul><li>The games won't create themselves (we've already looked into that), so we'll need to pay our talented employees to keep them around.  We also want to be able to provide some healthcare for our team as we want our employees to be happy and worry free so that we can create the best games possible.<br/>
</li></ul>
<li><b>Development hardware</b></li>
<ul><li>We'll need servers, computers, and some drawing tablets for our artists, in addition to our testing devices (tablets, phones, low-end computers.)  After all, we need to make sure our projects run smoothly on the platforms we're releasing them on.</li></ul>
<li><b>Development Software</b></li>
<ul><li>This is much more expensive than you might think.  Everything from Microsoft Office to Adobe Photoshop needs to be purchased in order for us to operate legally, and we definitely want to operate legally.</li></ul>
<li><b>An ""office""</b></li>
<ul><li>We'll call it an office for now, but really we're going to be using any affordable space we can find.  If there's an Internet connection and a place for us to sit, it'll work for now.  It might be a house, a storage unit, or a coffee house, but we'll find somewhere and we'll make it work until we can afford a place of our own!</li></ul>
<li><b>The IndieGoGo Cut</b></li>
<ul><li>We're thrilled to have found IndieGoGo, and their platform is providing a tremendous opportunity for us.  They certainly deserve their commission, but that adds an extra ""expense"" to us.  We keep the majority of the funds we raise, but a small percentage will go to IndieGoGo.  We just wanted to make sure we're prepared for the sharing of funds.</li></ul>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If we're able to meet our goal, we'd love to continue fundraising to help with other aspects of our studio.  Some of the things we'd be able to do with more capital include:<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Hiring more employees</li>
<li>Developing a larger-scoped project</li>
<li>Releasing titles at a lower price point (or free for everyone!)</li>

</h3>
<p>In addition to your financial support, there are several other ways you can get involved and help us get off the ground.  One of the biggest things we can ask is that you share our campaign and objectives with everybody you can think of.  If you can't help financially, maybe one of your friends can, or one of their friends can.  We're relying on our fans to help spread awareness and get the word out.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The second thing we welcome is to interact with us on our social media sites.  We have Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus accounts in addition to our standard website.  We'd love to be able to share photos, videos, and conversations with all of you, and social networking is the easiest (and most fun) way to do that.  Invite your friends, your family, and your computer-savvy pets to join with us, and let's see how many fans/friends/users we can grab before Good Friday.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The final thing we'll ask you to do is to pray.  We believe in the power of prayer, and if our mission is something you believe in, please think of us in your conversations with God.  Starting a business from the ground-floor is a daunting task, and we can use all the help we can get!</p>

<h3>What is the game about?</h3>
<p>Kings Forge is a sandbox building game for the PC, with an emphasis on multiplayer Kingdom managment and warfare. The game takes place in a procedurally generated voxel world where players can build and destroy structures and items as well as capture land. Inspired by games like Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress, Kings Forge is a unique middle ground of managing your loyal subjects and Kingdom members and a third person action role playing game.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The key aspects that make up Kings Forge are:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: 800;"">Kingdoms </span>are created by a group of players and allow you to capture sections of land based upon how many members you have within the Kingdom itself. All captured land is protected from the destruction of other players not within the Kingdom who claim it. Kingdom's also give you access to a wide variety of characters which can be summoned to help perform tasks and guard your Kingdom from invaders.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Item Forging </b>is the process of creating clothing and other items from cubes. Much like the world in Kings Forge players can build their own items block by block allowing you to look completely unique and trade your unique items for goods or currency with other players. </li>
<li>
<b>Adventures </b>and unique loot are scattered around the procedurally generated world and as you explore it you will encounter warbands of unfriendly monsters and stumble upon tricky boss fights deep within the dark caverns. </li>
<li>
<b>Combat </b>in the game consists of melee, range and magic with unique and interesting effects such as igniting your opponents. The unique weapons, spells and buffs available in the game makes combat against both players and NPCs fast and exciting.</li>
<li>
<b>Modding </b>will be introduced further into the development of the game with the ability to load C# scripts for blocks, actors and items allowing you to make your servers truly unique without the worry that each update to the game will change the API and break your scripts or mods.

<h3>How far completed is the game and where does the money go?</h3>
<p>I've been programming, creating art and creating content for Kings Forge for roughly 6 months by myself with the occasional help of a friend creating textures and 3D models for the game, you can view my progress through the development of the game on my <a href=""http://sciencefact.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">blog</a>. I currently have a full time job and cannot afford to work on it all the time. The game itself is roughly 70% done however it lacks a lot of animation and sound content. The money you give will allow me to hire Musicians and Artists for a short period of time to help create the remaining content I cannot create myself. On top of that it will allow me to put a lot more time into the game without worry of financial burden until its alpha release.</p>

All contributions equal or above $10 will have access to the closed internal testing of the game which will come before the initial alpha release. All contributions equal or above $30 will have your real or username added to a list of names that characters within the world are randomly assigned.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford or do not wish to donate to the game you can help by spreading the word about the game and helping attract media attention and contributor attention.

</div></div>","What is the game about?
Kings Forge is a sandbox building game for the PC, with an emphasis on multiplayer Kingdom managment and warfare. The game takes place in a procedurally generated voxel world where players can build and destroy structures and items as well as capture land. Inspired by games like Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress, Kings Forge is a unique middle ground of managing your loyal subjects and Kingdom members and a third person action role playing game.

The key aspects that make up Kings Forge are:



Kingdoms are created by a group of players and allow you to capture sections of land based upon how many members you have within the Kingdom itself. All captured land is protected from the destruction of other players not within the Kingdom who claim it. Kingdom's also give you access to a wide variety of characters which can be summoned to help perform tasks and guard your Kingdom from invaders.


Item Forging is the process of creating clothing and other items from cubes. Much like the world in Kings Forge players can build their own items block by block allowing you to look completely unique and trade your unique items for goods or currency with other players. 

Adventures and unique loot are scattered around the procedurally generated world and as you explore it you will encounter warbands of unfriendly monsters and stumble upon tricky boss fights deep within the dark caverns. 

Combat in the game consists of melee, range and magic with unique and interesting effects such as igniting your opponents. The unique weapons, spells and buffs available in the game makes combat against both players and NPCs fast and exciting.

Modding will be introduced further into the development of the game with the ability to load C# scripts for blocks, actors and items allowing you to make your servers truly unique without the worry that each update to the game will change the API and break your scripts or mods. On top of this the game is currently reskinnable by simply dropping your textures in the skinning folder. This will make mods also very easy to distribute and combine.

Building in Kings Forge is similar to that of voxel based games such as Minecraft with a variety of different block types with different strengths and uses. Build for fun or build defensely to prevent other Kingdoms stealing your riches. 

Multiplayer is a massive part of the game. Players can host their own persistent servers to play with friends and make new ones. The game is exclusively multiplayer with no single player component and encourages players to work together building and managing Kingdoms.

Releasing on iOS, Android, PC and Mac in mid 2014, Catharsis is a sprite-based steampunk RPG aimed at reaching both a new audience as well as appealing to older RPG fans by changing things up.</p><p style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">
Catharsis follows the story of four citizens dragged into a conflict to save their nation; Rhogar, the engineer; Kay, his partner mysteriously brought back from death; Ares, a black market dealer; and Mathias; a bartender with a shady past. As they struggle to restore power to their country, they face off against the rich and powerful Count Arthur who has his own agenda for Textoria.

We have a few of the best artists, programmers, composers, and others working for us, so the bigger our budget, the more quality content our game will feature; such as a greater and longer soundtrack, more sprite assets allowing for more frames of animation and detail, and paying developer fees to submit to marketplaces.</p><p style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">

What happens if we go over our funding goal? We've thought about that and we can put your generous donations to good effect!</p><p style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">
Firstly, a good portion of your donations will go straight into a marketing balance we can use for both digital and print media. Working with <a href=""http://www.blindferretmedia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blind Ferret Media</a> we will be able to reach a wide target audience with specifically targeted game and mobile websites. Facebook marketing can help us reach across the social media network to bring in more fans, and we can try to get some small ads onto the larger game review sites, such as IGN and Gametrailers.</p><p style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">
As well as the internet, a secondary market of print media such as flyers, posters, train carriage ads, etc. could be arranged for a small campaign right before release, hopefully bringing up our chances of getting the name of Dead Teddy Dev out there.</p><p style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">
Of course marketing would be a main focus, we would also be able to afford to pay our sprite artist and composer for more work, creating a more detailed world for you to explore, as well as purchase any upgrades for programs and hardware we could use to make a better product or potential language translations for other marketplace regions. Rest assured whatever we earn, will be put to good use.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deadteddydev.com.au/resources/funding_campaign_assets/stretch%20goal%20chart.png"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 15%;""/></p>

Set in the country of Textoria, a waning culture suffers as the power generation capabilities continue to decline, slowly sending the population into survival mode- black markets, racketeering and dissent emerging in cities and towns across the nation. The Engineering Corps is dedicated to maintaining the largescale steam-generator system that powers the country's energy grid, though they fight a losing battle after the original inventor, only known as the ""Architect"", mysteriously vanished the day the prototype system was activated. Without his knowledge, the capability to maintain or repair the degradation was limited, and ultimately only delayed the downfall of their civilisation.<br/><br/></p><h3>Using the Ethanon Engine</h3>
<p style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">
Using the <a href=""http://ethanonengine.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ethanon Engine</a> we have the chance to bring a new look to sprite RPGs. We can render 2D sprites in a 3D environment, giving a whole new depth to the world and the characters; realtime lighting and shadows, shine for metal, and particle effects for things such as fire and rain.
Older RPG fans will be familiar with the party micro-managing, but new players will find an easy experience allowing your party to take over the action for you during combat. Characters can be set to automatically take the initiative and attack enemies or heal up when damaged according to preset conditions, or they can be switched to manual control to let the player have greater control over what happens.
</p>
<h3>Game Features</h3>
<p style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">
However we didn't stop there - As you explore the world, the weather can change which not only adds immersion, but drastically affects combat strategies you need to get through alive. This means you'll rarely have the same experience twice.</p><p style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">
The more time you spend in Textoria, the more time passes in-game, creating a day-nite cycle to take full advantage of the new look Ethanon gives us. As well as a dynamic world, the current idea of side-quests becoming fetch-quests and grinding for levels, Catharsis takes away levels to have individual attributes to increase, raising character's effectiveness how they like, as well as side-quests being story-based and expanding on backgrounds and adding depth to the people fighting with you. In some cases, this may even effect their combat abilities; a finished side-story is less to worry about so they can focus on the adventure at hand.

Feel the love all year round with a Dead Teddy Dev, Catharsis-themed calendar. Not only featuring some of our artwork and characters, but we'll be sure to have a month dedicated to mentioning the contributors who made a difference and got into the credits!





Wear your support with pride! With several levels of perks to choose from, ranging from smaller donations to the larger, you can get yourself a Dead Teddy Support T-Shirt, or a special Catharsis campaign shirt to show off to all your friends!
Please note the Catharsis Campaign options are limited runs, so get in quick!



Feel like your iPod/iPhone/iPad/Samsung looks a bit bland? Spice it up with one of our cover perks. Same as with the T-Shirts, we have a Dead Teddy Dev Support option, as well as the unique Catharsis Campaign to choose from.
On offer are cases for iPhone 3-5, iPod 4G, iPad 2-4, and Samsung Galaxy S3 & S4.
Same as the shirts, the Catharsis iOS covers are in limited supply, so don't wait too long!





What gamer doesn't want to have their name in the credits? If you pick this perk, you'll be listed as a valued contributor at the end of the game. All perks above this will include your name in the credits too.



Our artist will sit down with some photos of you and transform you into a 2D sprite likeness and we'll put you in the game for people to find and interact with.





Just being there isn't enough? Have your say and give your 2D sprite a one-liner of your own. We'll sit down with you and come up with something witty, profound, or just silly. Within reason of course...



Open to any residents (or visitors) of Melbourne; feel like catching up with the local development team members for a drink? We'd love to meet our new fans and get to know you! Time and location TBD after the campaign ends.





We will have a large world for players to explore throughout Catharsis. Wouldn't it be cool if you could name somewhere after yourself or come up with a unique name? Here's your chance! Within reason of course; no trademarks or copyright names, no profanity, etc.



Within the universe of Catharsis, there's a lot of background and side stories that add depth to the experience. Any writers out there who want to stretch their imaginations and contribute should check this perk out and help us create some awesome stories.





This is the big one. For such a huge show of support, we'll list you in the credits as a co-director of the game and give you a shout-out whenever we talk about the game. That's how awesome you are.


Please bear in mind if you want a perk that requires postage to add somewhere between $5-$10 for postage, as we can't anticipate where everyone will donate from. Also remember that any donation over $20 will net you the perk, as well as the game and soundtrack!



What happens if we go over our funding goal? We've thought about that and we can put your generous donations to good effect!
Firstly, a good portion of your donations will go straight into a marketing balance we can use for both digital and print media. Working with Blind Ferret Media we will be able to reach a wide target audience with specifically targeted game and mobile websites. Facebook marketing can help us reach across the social media network to bring in more fans, and we can try to get some small ads onto the larger game review sites, such as IGN and Gametrailers.
As well as the internet, a secondary market of print media such as flyers, posters, train carriage ads, etc. could be arranged for a small campaign right before release, hopefully bringing up our chances of getting the name of Dead Teddy Dev out there.
Of course marketing would be a main focus, we would also be able to afford to pay our sprite artist and composer for more work, creating a more detailed world for you to explore, as well as purchase any upgrades for programs and hardware we could use to make a better product or potential language translations for other marketplace regions. Rest assured whatever we earn, will be put to good use.


Set in the country of Textoria, a waning culture suffers as the power generation capabilities continue to decline, slowly sending the population into survival mode- black markets, racketeering and dissent emerging in cities and towns across the nation. The Engineering Corps is dedicated to maintaining the largescale steam-generator system that powers the country's energy grid, though they fight a losing battle after the original inventor, only known as the ""Architect"", mysteriously vanished the day the prototype system was activated. Without his knowledge, the capability to maintain or repair the degradation was limited, and ultimately only delayed the downfall of their civilisation.Using the Ethanon Engine

Using the Ethanon Engine we have the chance to bring a new look to sprite RPGs. We can render 2D sprites in a 3D environment, giving a whole new depth to the world and the characters; realtime lighting and shadows, shine for metal, and particle effects for things such as fire and rain.
Older RPG fans will be familiar with the party micro-managing, but new players will find an easy experience allowing your party to take over the action for you during combat. Characters can be set to automatically take the initiative and attack enemies or heal up when damaged according to preset conditions, or they can be switched to manual control to let the player have greater control over what happens.

Game Features

However we didn't stop there - As you explore the world, the weather can change which not only adds immersion, but drastically affects combat strategies you need to get through alive. This means you'll rarely have the same experience twice.
The more time you spend in Textoria, the more time passes in-game, creating a day-nite cycle to take full advantage of the new look Ethanon gives us. As well as a dynamic world, the current idea of side-quests becoming fetch-quests and grinding for levels, Catharsis takes away levels to have individual attributes to increase, raising character's effectiveness how they like, as well as side-quests being story-based and expanding on backgrounds and adding depth to the people fighting with you. In some cases, this may even effect their combat abilities; a finished side-story is less to worry about so they can focus on the adventure at hand.




Our future in games is only as bright as you make it, and we can't wait to listen to our community and make the games they ask for. So get the word out and share our page and links around with your friends and family!
Also an open invitation to any linguists out there; as an English-speaking team, we would love to work with people to expand Catharsis into other languages. We appreciate all the help we can get!

Thank you for your support, and stay tuned for this exciting adventure steampunk game!",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>I am <strong>gustavo ""d2bowie""</strong> . For the past year or so i strived to deliver somewhat concise yet as deep as i could possible deliver dota content on my youtube channel. Every time there's a new patch or a change of play style to a hero i try to research it and keep everyone updated on the high mmr trends. When sven got back in 7.06 i made this one for example:</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/DLb6-5OThuY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> As far as my background goes I am a Brazilian chemical engineer dropout that always loved the game and content production in general . I never had a clear goal when I got into this yet I always wanted to get more involved in the scene , <strong>that's the reason i chose english instead of portuguese as the language of my channel. Impacting as many people as possible always felt obvious to me even under hard circustances. For a Brazilian I had ""decent"" english one year ago and i feel like i came a long way </strong>(even though my accent has a lot to improve)<strong>.</strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8KVvZ7mcPc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>While i can say i make a ""living"" out of dota and that i love making these videos i always wanted to go to the international. That being said, starting a crowdfunding only to attend ti is not my goal here. I want to give back to everyone that follows my work but also to the community.  I want to change the way dota content is made for the 10k redditors as well as the casual viewer.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, valve makes amazing content about the <strong>players lives</strong> . I feel like not too much emphasis is given to the <strong>players' styles</strong> though. I understand that a team even when they don't change players will switch ""styles"" because dota is an everchanging game and if you want to keep winning you have to adapt. My channel was always about this though, following trends and talking about them. </p>
<p>I would also like to add my twist on interviews as well. As i said before, understanding a team's playstyle better would help the casual viewer to grasp what's going on in a deeper way. <strong>This type of interview would be aimed at getting more experienced players</strong> (that sometimes don't care too much about the players) <strong>to see dota through a pro player's eyes</strong>. I know that there's a stigma to talk about strats during ti , i get that. My idea would be to ask other pros opinions on what an enemy team did or their ranked game experiences.<strong> I feel like some of the awkwardness that comes with pro interviews is that the game gets completely ignored most of the time and that is something they are clearly passionate about</strong>:<br/><br/><strong>""Did you like NP's mid visage, why ? "" , ""What's your most important solo queue tip"" , "" Why is techies not in cm?"" , ""If you had to share a room with techies or pudge, which would you choose?""</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn't bombard them with only these type of questions yet having a little bit of dota in the interviews is something i feel like a lot of people would enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>GETTING DOWN TO BUSSINESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> What I want to achieve before TI7</p>
<p>I will make a series of 3 videos about the invited teams (if we have more than 3 invites) everyone that donated is going to participate in a pool to vote which teams they want me to talk about (would love to add more, but since i'm on a clock i don't want to promise more than i can chew). I'll try to convey based on their last tournaments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic strategy : Who is the star of the team ?  , Top picks ? , Do they fight a lot ?</li>
<li>Team mannerisms: What are their common objectives at 10 mins into the game ? Do they smoke mid with their lvl 6 supports ? Do they force the safe lane tower ? Farm is their prioritity ?</li>
<li>Expect underground memes and something between purge and slacks in the humour spectrum</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>  2. </strong>During TI7</p>
<p>This one is slightly trickier .  There's a lot of things i want to do yet it's kinda hard to promise pro interviews. I'm a no one. Add the fact that people don't like giving interviews while they are in the tournament and even less after they lose and we have where i am.</p>
<p>I'll try to get as many pro interviews as i can. i hope that if this actually gets funded the visibility of it will help with credibility when i start looking for them.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>After TI7</p>
<p><strong>What's the biggest problem with these ""finals analysis"" videos ? They are super long</strong>. Even if arteezy made a 3 hour video (naked) talking about them i'm not sure i would actually watch it all. When i first started my channel i always tried to sum up a 40~50 min game in something like a 13 min video. I know important information gets lost in the process but as i said before i'm all about finding a comfortable spot between accessible and informative.</p>
<p>I will make an in depth (yet time friendly) video about every game and<strong> i would also like to make a video with pro player's opinions on what happened.  If this gets big and people decide to participate i would love to have a ton of different pros giving their inputs in the finals . This is probably very possible since after ti the patch and the game will change considerably, meaning that they are way less likely to resist on sharing. </strong></p>
<p>What do i need to make this happen  ?</p>
<ul>
<li>equipment : i own a canon g7x ii which is a decent enough camera i feel like . I would need a bunch of extra bateries and memory sticks though.  I would also need decent microphones to get a good final product</li>
<li>Two flight tickets from brazil to seattle and 10 days of hotel/airbnb</li>
<li>I don't have a ti7 ticket lol  (this is probably the smallest of my problems) . There was the chance of me going with another crew and getting a press ticket but it didn't happen.</li>
<li>since i probably won't have enough to actually pay the person that goes with me for their time (7~10 days of filming 12 hours a day is actually damn expensive) i would like to at least cover their food/uber/expenses</li>

<p>In addition, we incorporated a scrollwheel button,  two front/side buttons, and two thumb buttons, for secondary click actions.</p>

<h1>A Multi-functional Precision Tool for Designers</h1>
<p>Professionals such as artists, surgeons, chefs and carpenters all demand the highest quality, precision tools to perform their work. Now all designers on a computer can have in their hands the best multi-functional precision tool available. </p>
<p>Panning, zooming and rotation in CAD and Desktop Publishing, is like second nature with The Z, and the  6-axis in-air control opens up a whole new way of manipulating 3D objects,</p>
<p>With software like Photoshop and Illustrator you can use the force sensitive buttons to set brush thickness, the harder you push, the thicker the line. We also use the pivot action of The Z, to allow you to draw sweeping brush strokes that are a more natural and pen-like.</p>
<p>We've enhanced overall precision with a feature we call <i>Tactile Steps. </i>In this mode, The Z moves the cursor one unit at a time, and gives tactile feedback for each unit of movement. It makes increasing / decreasing values extremely easy - and something like 'nudging an object three pixels to the right' can be achieved with absolute precision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Rock-solid Performance &amp; Personalised Ergonomics </span></h1>
<p><b>OLED Screen for fast configuration</b></p>
<p>We wanted to make the The Z the easiest mouse to configure, so we added an OLED screen. Lifting The Z to look at the screen is a gesture that we recognize, so we automatically put it into configure mode, to swiftly change profiles, DPI, or other settings. </p>
<div data-id=""12808172""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/808/172/6434b8ec1857038763456b844f8eddd5_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1466484993&amp;q=92&amp;s=da3688c03cabd040004967814e6845ae"" src=""""/><figcaption>Lift the mouse to look at the OLED screen, and The Z automatically goes into configure mode</figcaption></figure></div>
<p><b>No Lag, No Drag </b></p>
<p>None of us want to worry about batteries or wireless reliability and latency …so while we made the Z wired, we also eliminated the issue of cable drag by building a brushed aluminum cube into the mouse-mat for perfect positioning of the cord, right off the desk surface. </p>

With The Z, we paid the same attention to a full sized mouse and tested hundreds of prototypes to create what we believe is the best shaped mouse ever built….</p>
<p>The main click buttons have been flattened, so that when you click, you are opposing the desk surface with no chance of nudging the mouse.</p>
<p>We’ve balanced The Z so that when you lift it, the weight is evenly distributed between your thumb, ring and little finger.</p>

Now, after more than three years of development, we are ready to launch The Z. It's the world’s first mouse to pivot, tilt and roll, with a brand new way of clicking buttons - meaning you can access dozens of different button actions while barely moving your fingers. The Z also senses how hard you click, giving variable speed / force control, and provides tactile feedback, so you know when you’ve made a ‘deeper click’. If you are a Designer or home and office Power User, please check out the info right after the gaming section. If you’re a Gamer… read on….  The Z for Gamers Tilt Left or Right
 With the mouse on the desk surface, you can tilt left and right for fast mode changes without using your fingers or pushing buttons. You can assign any action to tilt, like leaning, crouching or reloading. Alternatively use it as a modifier key (like shift or control) without actually having to press a button or key!  

Use Tilt to lean and take a shot
 When playing a game that involves driving - use tilt to take direct analog control of the steering wheel. We’ve made sure that the ability to tilt doesn’t affect the rock solid performance of normal mousing and have designed adjustable and replaceable feet that can make the tilt easier or harder or set a large or small tilt angle. Or if you want, you can lock out tilt altogether.  Pivot Action The Z also knows when it is pivoting left or right - this gives you a huge competitive advantage in many first or third-person shooters. You can run straight ahead and at the same time look left and right with analog control (the same way as you would with a VR headset). It provides tactile feedback so you know when you’re facing forward, or looking to the side.Use Pivot to look left and rightJust like tilt, you can assign any action, modifier (e.g control or shift) to a pivot. Everything is configurable. Pitch, Roll & Yaw - In the Air or on the GroundThe Z knows when it’s on the table and when it’s in the air. For games like Battlefield, just lift up for in air control. Once you're in the air use the W/S keys for thrust (or lift), and The Z for pitch, roll, yaw.Lift up The Z, for a short burst of precise flight controlFor longer periods of flight, just place the mouse on the supplied 3-Axis extender and take command with direct free-form control - your hand resting comfortably on the desk.Place the Z on the 3-Axis Extender for the ultimate free-form control of flight and space simsAnother great use for the The Z, is for intuitive camera control in spectator mode.For Tilt, Pivot and In Air Gestures, we provide further analog support for games that are compatible with game controller’s analog sticks, by reporting to the game that we are simultaneously, both a mouse, and an analog controller. 50 clickable button actions.... while barely moving a finger.Many mice pack in additional buttons around the thumb grip and all over the device. We’ve figured out a new way of clicking that means you can have more buttons, that are effortless to click with no finger or thumb contortions required. The Z has a new type of trigger button. It can be used by simply straightening your finger slightly and then clicking – while still gripping the mouse as normal, with your fingers poised on the main left and right click buttons. They are so easy to click that you can use them for actions you do frequently, like reloading, jumping or crouching.You can pull them like a trigger as well. These two buttons are in effect four buttons.
 
We’ve also added adjustable fingertip buttons, that can be accessed with very little finger movement. 
 

Combine pivot and tilt with trigger and fingertip buttons, to effortlessly access over 50 different actions (48 plus left and right click) - all while maintaining a full grip for maximum control on the mouse.
50 fingertip click actions in 10 seconds!
In addition, we incorporated a scrollwheel button,  two front/side buttons, and two thumb buttons, for secondary click actions.
Needless to say The Z makes a great MMO, RPG or MOBA mouse.
The trigger buttons and fingertip button positions are all adjustable (and removable) to perfectly suit your hand size and type of mouse grip.
 
Deep click with Tactile Feedback
The main left and right buttons and two fingertip buttons all support Deep Click.
Configure the amount of force that suits you (from easy to 'off'), and The Z gives you tactile feedback to let you know when it's activated. 
You can use Deep Click in an analog mode to have direct throttle control or speed when driving, flying or running
 
In a First-Person Shooter… right click to bring up your scope, click deeper to zoom in, then deeper again to hold your breath and steady your sights... now take the shot.
 
For games that have light and heavy attacks, use normal click for a light attack, or click harder to launch a heavy attack. 

A look behind the scenes.
We captured some raw video of Grant demonstrating some of the tools we have created to help develop The Z, and also show the '3 axis extender' which we will include for free for each mouse shipped...
 


A Huge Boost in Productivity for Power Users
Home and office power users can use the speed and precision of the most advanced multi-functional gaming mouse to blast through spreadsheets, documents, emails and presentations. 
Tasks like selecting and copying text are faster and more intuitive with the Deep Click pressure sensitive buttons of The Z....
Double click to select a word, press a bit harder to select the paragraph, then a bit harder again to select the entire document.
 We also brought ‘copy and paste’ into the 21st century…
Deep Click the right button to copy text, and slightly harder again to paste - it’s extremely fast and intuitive with tactile feedback
You can pan up and down or any direction of a document or image... 
Simply tilt the mouse to the right then move in the direction you want to scroll.
  
A Multi-functional Precision Tool for Designers
Professionals such as artists, surgeons, chefs and carpenters all demand the highest quality, precision tools to perform their work. Now all designers on a computer can have in their hands the best multi-functional precision tool available. 
Panning, zooming and rotation in CAD and Desktop Publishing, is like second nature with The Z, and the  6-axis in-air control opens up a whole new way of manipulating 3D objects,
With software like Photoshop and Illustrator you can use the force sensitive buttons to set brush thickness, the harder you push, the thicker the line. We also use the pivot action of The Z, to allow you to draw sweeping brush strokes that are a more natural and pen-like.
We've enhanced overall precision with a feature we call Tactile Steps. In this mode, The Z moves the cursor one unit at a time, and gives tactile feedback for each unit of movement. It makes increasing / decreasing values extremely easy - and something like 'nudging an object three pixels to the right' can be achieved with absolute precision.
 
 
Rock-solid Performance & Personalised Ergonomics 
OLED Screen for fast configuration
We wanted to make the The Z the easiest mouse to configure, so we added an OLED screen. Lifting The Z to look at the screen is a gesture that we recognize, so we automatically put it into configure mode, to swiftly change profiles, DPI, or other settings. 
Lift the mouse to look at the OLED screen, and The Z automatically goes into configure mode
No Lag, No Drag 
None of us want to worry about batteries or wireless reliability and latency …so while we made the Z wired, we also eliminated the issue of cable drag by building a brushed aluminum cube into the mouse-mat for perfect positioning of the cord, right off the desk surface. 
No cable drag
 
Brushed aluminum cable management
 
Ergonomics and Accuracy 
Our last device –  the Swiftpoint GT mobile mouse, was quoted as ‘The Most Comfortable Mouse on the Market’ by The Huffington Post. With The Z, we paid the same attention to a full sized mouse and tested hundreds of prototypes to create what we believe is the best shaped mouse ever built….
The main click buttons have been flattened, so that when you click, you are opposing the desk surface with no chance of nudging the mouse.
We’ve balanced The Z so that when you lift it, the weight is evenly distributed between your thumb, ring and little finger.
When you grip the mouse, the weight is evenly distributed between your thumb, ring and little finger
The feet underneath are replaceable and adjustable to configure an easier or harder tilt, or no tilt at all. The Trigger buttons and fingertip buttons are also configurable and removable.  You can set your own force thresholds for Deep Click, or turn it off altogether. 
…..and of course… we have the glowing RGB LED logo.
 
 
The Z + Swiftpoint GT Pack!
In response to requests from backers, we have added combo packs for 2 mice. The Z, and our other device, the award winning Swiftpoint GT Mouse.
The Swiftpoint GT, was launched to retail last year and received the best innovation award at the largest trade show in the US (the CES), IT Enquirer even rated it as 'the best mouse of the 21st Century""!

<h3>Time for a true revolution of gaming - INDIEGO Roots of Gaming</h3>
<p>The INDIEGO! is a retro, indie and NexGen Video Game Console. Why rebuy your old retro games all the time...? Play your originals on the INDIEGO!</p>
<p>Based on our experiences we made with our work around AROS and the creation of AEROS (<a href=""http://www.aeros-os.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.aeros-os.org</a>). We provide you a single device which can run your existing Amiga (CD32), AROS, DOS, Windows and Linux games. But not only limited to those. </p>
<p>Just insert for example a CD32 CD and the INDIEGO! will check the disc, recognize the game and offer you to run it. Same for DOS, Windows and Linux and other console games. </p>
<p>Due to the open character and the support for Homebrew everyone is invited to add more support for more platforms and games. </p>
<p>To offer also NexGen and all the excellent Indie games available, the INDIEGO comes with a STEAM, a desura and a INDIEGO store client.</p>
<p><img alt=""Logo concepts"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.aeros-os.org/igo3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>We have more steam than OUYA</h3>
Because the INDIEGO! is a Steambox and it has much more under the hood.
<h3>Open means no barriers and no enforcement to register again and again and again.... spend your money where you like.</h3>
<p>Others call themself ""open"" because they use a opensource OS as core... we do too.</p>
<p>In our case we use a system derived from Ubuntu (see <a href=""http://www.aeros-os.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.aeros-os.org</a> for old versions)...  But for our definition this is not ""open"" enough.</p>
<p>Imagine you registered on STEAM... well stay there and enjoy your games on the INDIEGO with your own account.</p>
<p>You like Desura.. well than use Dersura to get your favorite games..</p>
<p>Check INDIEGO store as an alternative and decide which store offers the best price.</p>
<p>You like Onlive.. ok use it on your INDIEGO straight from your sofa.</p>
<p>This is freedom and not a dictated game library and prices.</p>
<p>And being able to run a game you bought already for PC/LINUX, Amiga and other consoles is nice too. </p>
<h3>INDIEGO! is a platform for digital art. </h3>
<p>Enjoy our Demo Scene channel - watch, enjoy, share your  favorite scene demos for nearly every homecomputer or console straight on your TV. </p>
<p>Who needs a VJ ; ) </p>
<h3>Is it just us? Or do you like physical media too... we like to collect. </h3>
<p>We will be something really really ""special""...you really won't believe it... we add a SD-card slot AND a DVD-RW driver... if the fundrising will succeed we will add a Blu-Ray drive.</p>
<p>Why? Because I like my classic collections and we will re-launch and publish new Indie creations for the INDIEGO. All in a limited and collectible way.. Some on SD-card, some on USB-Stick and some on CD/DVD. </p>
<p>A drive/ a door allows YOU to add more Homebrew, enjoy and share music and videos with friends and family. </p>
<p><img alt=""red, silver or fully black"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.aeros-os.org/indiegored.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>INDIEGO! Is the easiest target platform for every coder.</h3>
<p>Code as always.. chance are very high that the INDIEGO! Will run it. </p>
<p>Based on a multi-hybrid-OS the system runs a lot of stuff for different CPU-architectures.</p>
<p>Just code in the language you like and embedd the result in a INDIEGO! app container. </p>
<p>Ask us for more details.</p>
<p>No special SDK needed. We help you to setup the built in SDK's for your needs or to setup your used one on your INDIEGO.</p>
<h3>The OS</h3>
<p>The core OS is a heavily customized Ubuntu based on our experiences with AEROS. </p>
<p>The UI is called IGNAS and because design matters we will make it skinnable. </p>
<p>Due to the low footprint the OS consumes normally less than 128MB RAM.</p>
<h3>GAMES, games and even more games</h3>
<p>The INDIEGO! will come with many preinstalled games and demos and you can start playing your favorite C64, Amiga (CD32), DOS, Linux and Windows games from day one. </p>
<p>To allow you to store and collect games, the base systems comes with a 250GB HD (may be higher depending on fundraising).  </p>
<p>We will also support favorite Retro collections like AmigaForever, Amiga Classix, C64 Forever and others. But hey.. we support nearly everything..</p>
<h3>Photos, music, movies and Video on demand</h3>
<p>The INDIEGO supports a lot of media center applications like AmiMC (aka AMC in the Amiga Scene), XBMC and Plex.  </p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We are a group of retro-amigans and dreamers.. the difference to pure dreamers is that we aren't just talking but we really try something. </p>
<p>The idea for INDIEGO! comes from Pascal Papara member of Open Invention Network, (Distribution Mainatainer and publisher)</p>
<p>IGNAS the UI is done entirely by Fabio Falcucci (Scuilib, AmiMC, G.E.M.Z, Hfinder and more)</p>
<p>The needed changes to the AROS Kickstart replacement for CD32 are done by Jason McMullan (thank you for helping out and continous support for our beloved opensource OS) </p>
<p>Our spiritual roots are <a href=""http://www.aros.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.aros.org</a> -&gt; the Opensource reimplementation of AmigaOS and the classic Amiga system.</p>
<p>Our partners are André Nolte for design <a href=""http://andrenolte.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://andrenolte.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.pack-werk.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pack-werk.de</a> for the packaging. </p>
<p>We would also like to thank to all our partners in the small remaining AMIGA universe.. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What we need  &amp; What you get</h3>
<p>The INDIEGO! will be released for sure... even if this fundraising fails. </p>
<p>But if it succeeds we can enhance the final result with you! </p>
<p>With your pledge, we will:</p>
<p>switch from self-build to a cheaper manufactured product.</p>
<p>Reduce the price or make the package even better (more RAM, larger HD, Blueray instead DVD are just a few examples)</p>
<p>Also licensing media codecs for eg.blueray playback cost money.</p>
<p>But even without a pledge, we are looking for help. Tell the world about us. Help us to set up a nice and friendly comunity or be our speakerman in your country. Help to find distributors.. maybe you are systemseller?</p>
<h3>Our status, specs and how we plan to sell the INDIEGO!</h3>
<p>The work on the INDIEGO! started a long time ago.. in the meanwhile we had 2 prototype systems.</p>
<p>The first one was a dual 1GHZ APU, the second one is dual 1.6GHZ APU and right now we plan the following for the final system:</p>
<p>4x 3.6GHZ APU</p>
<p>AMD HD GPU</p>
<p>4 GB RAM</p>
<p>AMD HD GPU</p>
<p>DVD-RW</p>
<p>250GB 2.5"" HD</p>
<p>6x USB 2.0</p>
<p>SDHC-Slot </p>
<p>HDMI</p>
<p>7.1 HD Audio</p>
<p>All this is planned to be released for SUB 349€ in case the funding fails.. Starting from 100 preorders we can manage to offer it for 329€ and if this fundraising will be succesfull we can go sub 300€. 299,90€ to be honest.</p>
<p>But since design, packaging and development time costs we need your help to achieve this goal. </p>
<p>We also would like to get some initial funding for PR and early game development.</p>
<p>The first beta machines will be shipped end of march. Official release is planned for the 2nd half of 2013. First dev-kits can be shipped starting from end of march, followed by beta devices. The DEV-systems will be shipped with express shipment within europe.  </p>
<p>The INDIEGO! refference system will be produced and shipped buy us.</p>
<p>Systemseller can obtain a license to build their own INDIEGO consoles. Basically what has be done for the 3DO in the past. Feel free to ask about details. </p>
<p><img alt=""The direction for the packaging is set - now we need to fill it with the long feature list"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.aeros-os.org/indiego_p_box.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The packaging will be made by <a href=""http://www.pack-werk.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pack-werk.de</a></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>Q: Is this a normal PC?</p>
<p>A: Technically yes but the OS is especially made for a gaming console experience. Think about the first XBOX or any console to which Linux has been ported too.</p>
<p>Q: Ubuntu based? What is the difference to a ""normal"" PC runing Ubuntu with a bunch of emulators?</p>
<p>A: We don't use ""just"" Ubuntu as it is. See <a href=""http://www.aeros-os.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.aeros-os.org</a> and <a href=""http://www.aros.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.aros.org</a> for details. We are running a mixture of operating systems to have the best from both sides. Compatibility of Linux and the speed of AROS. Minus the overhead resulting from an normally bloated Linux environment. </p>
<p>Q: Amiga Kickstart isn't free, how do you provide compatibility to old consoles?</p>
<p>A: We use AROS which is an opensource reimplentation of AmigaOS 3.1. So it is legal.During the development Jason McMullan already improved the compatibiity to run ECS/OCS/AGA and CD32 based games. AEROS is a hybrid and run anything a developer could ask for.</p>
<p>With one click a developer can make an .igo package of his game for one of the supported Platforms. </p>
<p>Q: Is my money lost if I donate and you don't reach the target?</p>
<p>A: No, you will definetly get at least a discount in the same ammount you donated for <a href=""http://www.ares-shop.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ares-shop.de</a>. So if you donate for example 50€ and we will start the to take orders for the beta devices, you will get a discount code. </p>
<p>This fundraising is mainly to collect money in advance and to show potential resellers the public interest. Sure if it would be succesfull ""money wise"" it would prove it too. But getting Facebook followers is nice too. </p>
<p>Q: Will it have parental controlls</p>
<p>A: Fore sure, that sure hat whe didn't thought to announce it : ) Yes of course.</p>
<p>It will be a multiuser system. Every person in your home will get its own account and parents can take care about software being allowed. </p>
<p>Q: What about educational apps?</p>
<p>A: Here comes ""having Ubuntu under the hood"" very handy again. So yes. Most interactive CDROMs (Windows) will work out of the box. You can also use educational software for Linux and access Web-based services.  </p>
<p>Q: Can I still install Win8?</p>
<p>A:Yes you can. You can also install Operatingsystems like AROS and even those not made for X86 systems.</p>

</div></div>","Time for a true revolution of gaming - INDIEGO Roots of Gaming
The INDIEGO! is a retro, indie and NexGen Video Game Console. Why rebuy your old retro games all the time...? Play your originals on the INDIEGO!
Based on our experiences we made with our work around AROS and the creation of AEROS (www.aeros-os.org). We provide you a single device which can run your existing Amiga (CD32), AROS, DOS, Windows and Linux games. But not only limited to those. 
Just insert for example a CD32 CD and the INDIEGO! will check the disc, recognize the game and offer you to run it. Same for DOS, Windows and Linux and other console games. 
Due to the open character and the support for Homebrew everyone is invited to add more support for more platforms and games. 
To offer also NexGen and all the excellent Indie games available, the INDIEGO comes with a STEAM, a desura and a INDIEGO store client.

 
We have more steam than OUYA
Because the INDIEGO! is a Steambox and it has much more under the hood.
Open means no barriers and no enforcement to register again and again and again.... spend your money where you like.
Others call themself ""open"" because they use a opensource OS as core... we do too.
In our case we use a system derived from Ubuntu (see www.aeros-os.org for old versions)...  But for our definition this is not ""open"" enough.
Imagine you registered on STEAM... well stay there and enjoy your games on the INDIEGO with your own account.
You like Desura.. well than use Dersura to get your favorite games..
Check INDIEGO store as an alternative and decide which store offers the best price.
You like Onlive.. ok use it on your INDIEGO straight from your sofa.
This is freedom and not a dictated game library and prices.
And being able to run a game you bought already for PC/LINUX, Amiga and other consoles is nice too. 
INDIEGO! is a platform for digital art. 
Enjoy our Demo Scene channel - watch, enjoy, share your  favorite scene demos for nearly every homecomputer or console straight on your TV. 
Who needs a VJ ; ) 
Is it just us? Or do you like physical media too... we like to collect. 
We will be something really really ""special""...you really won't believe it... we add a SD-card slot AND a DVD-RW driver... if the fundrising will succeed we will add a Blu-Ray drive.
Why? Because I like my classic collections and we will re-launch and publish new Indie creations for the INDIEGO. All in a limited and collectible way.. Some on SD-card, some on USB-Stick and some on CD/DVD. 
A drive/ a door allows YOU to add more Homebrew, enjoy and share music and videos with friends and family. 

INDIEGO! Is the easiest target platform for every coder.
Code as always.. chance are very high that the INDIEGO! Will run it. 
Based on a multi-hybrid-OS the system runs a lot of stuff for different CPU-architectures.
Just code in the language you like and embedd the result in a INDIEGO! app container. 
Ask us for more details.
No special SDK needed. We help you to setup the built in SDK's for your needs or to setup your used one on your INDIEGO.
The OS
The core OS is a heavily customized Ubuntu based on our experiences with AEROS. 
The UI is called IGNAS and because design matters we will make it skinnable. 
Due to the low footprint the OS consumes normally less than 128MB RAM.
GAMES, games and even more games
The INDIEGO! will come with many preinstalled games and demos and you can start playing your favorite C64, Amiga (CD32), DOS, Linux and Windows games from day one. 
To allow you to store and collect games, the base systems comes with a 250GB HD (may be higher depending on fundraising).  
We will also support favorite Retro collections like AmigaForever, Amiga Classix, C64 Forever and others. But hey.. we support nearly everything..
Photos, music, movies and Video on demand
The INDIEGO supports a lot of media center applications like AmiMC (aka AMC in the Amiga Scene), XBMC and Plex.  
Who we are
We are a group of retro-amigans and dreamers.. the difference to pure dreamers is that we aren't just talking but we really try something. 
The idea for INDIEGO! comes from Pascal Papara member of Open Invention Network, (Distribution Mainatainer and publisher)
IGNAS the UI is done entirely by Fabio Falcucci (Scuilib, AmiMC, G.E.M.Z, Hfinder and more)
The needed changes to the AROS Kickstart replacement for CD32 are done by Jason McMullan (thank you for helping out and continous support for our beloved opensource OS) 
Our spiritual roots are www.aros.org -> the Opensource reimplementation of AmigaOS and the classic Amiga system.
Our partners are André Nolte for design http://andrenolte.com and www.pack-werk.de for the packaging. 
We would also like to thank to all our partners in the small remaining AMIGA universe.. 


What we need  & What you get
The INDIEGO! will be released for sure... even if this fundraising fails. 
But if it succeeds we can enhance the final result with you! 
With your pledge, we will:
switch from self-build to a cheaper manufactured product.
Reduce the price or make the package even better (more RAM, larger HD, Blueray instead DVD are just a few examples)
Also licensing media codecs for eg.blueray playback cost money.
But even without a pledge, we are looking for help. Tell the world about us. Help us to set up a nice and friendly comunity or be our speakerman in your country. Help to find distributors.. maybe you are systemseller?
Our status, specs and how we plan to sell the INDIEGO!
The work on the INDIEGO! started a long time ago.. in the meanwhile we had 2 prototype systems.
The first one was a dual 1GHZ APU, the second one is dual 1.6GHZ APU and right now we plan the following for the final system:
4x 3.6GHZ APU
AMD HD GPU
4 GB RAM
AMD HD GPU
DVD-RW
250GB 2.5"" HD
6x USB 2.0
SDHC-Slot 
HDMI
7.1 HD Audio
All this is planned to be released for SUB 349€ in case the funding fails.. Starting from 100 preorders we can manage to offer it for 329€ and if this fundraising will be succesfull we can go sub 300€. 299,90€ to be honest.
But since design, packaging and development time costs we need your help to achieve this goal. 
We also would like to get some initial funding for PR and early game development.
The first beta machines will be shipped end of march. Official release is planned for the 2nd half of 2013. First dev-kits can be shipped starting from end of march, followed by beta devices. The DEV-systems will be shipped with express shipment within europe.  
The INDIEGO! refference system will be produced and shipped buy us.
Systemseller can obtain a license to build their own INDIEGO consoles. Basically what has be done for the 3DO in the past. Feel free to ask about details. 

The packaging will be made by www.pack-werk.de
The Design of the Logo is done by Andre Noltè who made also the Ares Logo in the past (www.aros-braodway.de). 
Wait a minute... what about the INDIEGO! joypad?
Ha! How if not with the original controller would be the best way to play a retro game?
We support Microsofts XBOX360 for Windows Joypad, mouse and Keyboard... we won't fight the battle about ""Firstperson games are played better with joypad than with Keyboard-mouse"".. use your favorite input! Use your favorite device from your favorite vendor. Use a Wiimote... use a Competition Pro Joystick.. use whatever you like to use. No barriers. Your choice. Your individiuality. 
Help us to serve every gamers wishes. 
Let's build the one4all system together!


Remember! Even without a pledge you can help us:


Just speak about it, help us to gain some kudos from the gaming world. Share your thoughts.

If you want to receive updates on the progress you can subscribe to our blog: www.imagineearth.info/blogPlay our demo: Direct download or SteamThe final version will be distributed for Windows by DRM-free download. Since we won the Intel Level Up Award for the best Simulation Demo we can offer Steam keys to all backers as well.Build thriving colonies. Your development strategy shapes the destiny of whole planets from the very beginning. It all starts with landing your settlement capsule on a brave new world. This claims the territory for your colony. Building power plants, farms and factories will supply your people with resources and allow the cities to grow and prosper.Your people are the heart of your colony and fund its expansion. Only 
cities with happy people will grow and very happy people will pay you 
some bonus cash. So you should take care of local pollution and nearby 
buildings with bad influence.Only expanding colonies will be provided with additional landing 
permissions and research budget. Upgrade established technologies or 
develop new ones. Over 30 constructs and 60 upgrades with different 
advantages, influences and side effects are available and allow you to 
build your individual colony.The strategic placement of your production facilities is vital:

The build radius around your city center is limited
Some buildings influence each other (e.g. you better don’t place a farm next to a coal power plant)
Different field types increase or decrease the productivity of your facilities (e.g. fossil resource fields)
Pollution has an impact on your food production
Some fields are blocked by rocks or forest (helps to balance the pollution but can also be lumbered for money)

Beware: A fast growing civilization can bring your planet's ecosystem to its limits. Wildfires, dying forests, growing deserts and twisters will arise more frequently and require immediate action. Incidents in your facilities can lead to chemical leaks, oil spills or even radioactive contamination. All of them having a really bad effect on your people and the food production. Maintain your buildings and fight catastrophes immediately to avoid this.Ultimately, you will have to balance the rise of your civilization's greenhouse gas emissions with the capabilities of your planet and new technology. Otherwise global warming melts the ice at the polar caps and the rising sea level will flood your cities!You stand between the profit goals of the interstellar corporations and the need to 
preserve the conditions of living for your people. Meet corrupt chiefs and shareholders while your company faces hostile takeover by larger corporations. Each of the 5 missions takes place on another planet - one order of magnitude bigger than the previous. Every mission will have some unique elements, like cultural heritage sites or even incoming asteroids. Altogether, the story will have 10 to 20 hours of gameplay. Additionally, there will be a Free Game mode that allows you to build your colony in a relaxed way without any goals and a Time Trial mode that maximizes your expansion skills.Sounds perfect?

<p>This Game is a 3D online, multiplayer role-playing game, set in a medieval-fantasy world, with turn-based combat. We avoid calling it an mmorpg because it's different then most online multiplayer games. For one it's build to be easily moded and all the tools that This Game was made with will be  made available. But the most significant difference is that other online game have one or a few powerful servers run by the big companies, private servers (if they appear at all) are run with stolen software and  the big companies often fight and even prosecute people running private servers- but this is not the case with This Game! The server side software will be made available so that anyone who has a internet connection and a computer can host his own server with the maps, models, textures  armors, weapons, monsters and game rules of his own choosing or making.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Fund to play.</strong></h2>
<p>This Game is also a bit different when it comes to money. If the campaign goes well and the goal is reach then This Game will be Free.  Free as free beer, no fees, no micro payments, client, server and editor downloadable for no money at all. If we don’t reach the goal (it’s quite  lot of money after all) then the client will still be downloadable for free, so will be the editor (so one could still make a single-player module –something like the demo), but the server side software will cost money. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Gameplay.</strong></h2>
<p>There are no classes  in This Game. Just 3 aspects - magic, wits and combat. Every time a character gains enough experience to gain a level he or she can select one of these aspects. Raising Magic allows one to use more powerful magic items, cast deadlier spells and resist hostile magic. Raising Combat gives more hit points, increases the damage dealt with melee weapons and alows to use heavy equipment. Wits raises the chance to deliver a critical hit and avoid attacks, it also boost ones action points. To make characters more unique there are also Perks. A few chosen at character creation and others can be obtained during the game for example  after finishing a quest.</p>
<p>   </p>
<h2><strong>Craft.</strong></h2>
<p>Crafting is an important part of games these days, in This Game it also plays an important role but unlike in most other games items crafted by players are not the most powerful available item, it's quite the opposite. Because there are no skills devoted to crafting and gathering resources is fairly safe and simple, crafting an item costs next to nothing and that's why home-made items are considered low-quality. If you don't like it this way then there's no problem, changing the stats of items is just a matter of editing some numbers in a text file. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>PvP</strong></h2>
<p>This Game is open for player versus player combat and to make things more interesting the winner can take all the items that the loosing player had with him. Of course murdering random people is not an acceptable behavior and it will  have its consequences.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Player housing.</strong></h2>
<p>Because a player can loose all the items in his inventory when killed, it is important to have a place where one can safely store his items. A player can rent a chest, a room in an inn, or even a  whole house.   </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>System requirements.</strong></h2>
<p>This Game will run on Windows, Mac and Linux. 1 GHz CPU, 1 GB of RAM, a OpenGL compatible video card with 256 memory. The game should run on any computer made within the last 5 years. We do use per pixel lights, normal mapping, soft shadows, off-screen buffers and maybe some other 'advanced' techniques  but players will have the ability to turn all these off. We aim to make This Game playable even on 'netbooks' with integrated graphic cards. The demo we made runs at 70-105 FPS on 1.6GHz CPU with 2GB of RAM and a Radeon HD 3800Series  at 1280x1024.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Things that This Game will not have:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>A Cool Name (unless someone is willing to sponsor it)</li>
<li>mounts, pets, henchmen</li>
<li>oversized weapons</li>
<li>explosions of colored lights with every hit or 'skill' use</li>

</ul><h2>What is A Fallen Forest?</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.afallenforest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Fallen Forest</a> is an indie AS3 narrative tower defense flash game that follows the journey of the Red Squirrel Ash and his Badger companion Silver as they return to their homeland for the first time in years. As they get closer to home however, it becomes clear all is not what it seems… </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Fallen Forest will be free-to-play online</strong></li>
</ul><p>Based on the decline of forest wildlife worldwide, the game will also link real-world wildlife and environmental organisations to a wide and varied global demographic, providing an engaging platform to promote real causes.</p>
<p>The game is a collaboration between myself, <a href=""http://www.rtsharp.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert T Sharp</a>, a UK Native now living in Ontario, Canada (<em>BBC, UK Film Council</em>) and Italian programmer Davide Beltrame aka <strong>Brolyweb</strong> (<em>Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Pavesi, Kellogs</em>) along with several globally award winning artists. </p>

<h2>Why should I Start Throwing you some Finance?</h2>
<p>Simply put: To finish the game. So far I have fully self-funded the project. Because of this, the button of control is with me. I have been able to work with and support a small group of talented individuals from around the world, each of whom deserve to go far and have brought their own style and essence to the project. Gaining the <strong>$800 USD</strong> needed to complete the game from Indie Gogo would realise not only my vision and effort, but provide the team with a platform from which to build further success. The project has the potential to be enjoyed by literally hundreds of thousands of people world-wide. You have the power to be part of the project and part of that success. </p>
<p>More specifically your money will go towards creating original, high quality:</p>

</ul><h2>Why Squirrels?</h2>
<p>I'll be honest, they're hilarious.</p>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<h3>Ash</h3>
<p><img alt=""Ash"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.afallenforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/4122b4c050ad09268e9ca2c929160527_large.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Young, motivated and tactically sound, Ash has spent the last 4 years fighting the on front lines against the Grey Squirrel’s in foreign lands. Grown wise through the horrors of conflict, his military skills have been honed by consistent training and real life combat. His home forest was always too small for him and the only way out was through military conscription. He dreams of exploration, but must head home again before his next adventure…</span></p>
<h3><span>Silver</span></h3>
<p><span><img alt=""Silver"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.afallenforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/efc7e9480b86c85f957db6ce3cd70d17_large.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Newly retired, axe wielding and cheerfully drunk, Silver has had many years of experience on the front lines. Meeting Ash when he first arrived in his regiment, a bond was forged instantly. Heralding from the same forest as Ash and with a palate for drinking only the finest in alcoholic beverages, Silver was looking forward to retiring with his own pub at the heart of the forest community. Until he returned…</span></p>
<h3><span>Fluffy</span></h3>
<p><span><img alt=""Fluffy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.afallenforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/636a478bad8431ef43aeb5cef6a12802_large.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Rare and unknown. Other forest dwellers know nothing of her kind’s existence and it has remained that way since time immemorial. Comfortably living within the tunnelled and cavernous depths of the land, she has been forced to the surface in search of revenge. Discovering no-one on the surface, she has decided to hide and wait…</span></p>
<h3><span>Dusk</span></h3>
<p><span><img alt=""Dusk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.afallenforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DUSK-A5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Abandoned at a young age, Dusk’s earliest memory was of her first kill. Starving, cold and without shelter, that first field mouse taught her a valuable lesson. To trust her own instincts. Since then she has remained alone and has perfected her art. She watched the forest grow silent and cherished the solace, until unnatural life began…</span></p>
<h3><span>Myrm</span></h3>
<p><span><img alt=""Myrm"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.afallenforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/MYRM-A5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>She maintained the connection to her hive for as long as possible. Their voices became increasingly erratic and she couldn’t guide them any longer. Heralding from a long line of powerful wood ant ancestry, for the first time in their history Myrm is forced to move on alone…</span></p>
<h2>Why create A Fallen Forest? </h2>
<p>With a dawning realization. After several years of successfully creating and working on independent film productions (short films, documentaries and a feature film), I was able to transfer my production skills and experience to the interactive sector to create games, which is where my main creative passions thrive. I have an innate desire to create and tell a good story well, and the interactive world opens doors to possibilities you simply cannot achieve within the screen sector.</p>

What is A Fallen Forest?
A Fallen Forest is an indie AS3 narrative tower defense flash game that follows the journey of the Red Squirrel Ash and his Badger companion Silver as they return to their homeland for the first time in years. As they get closer to home however, it becomes clear all is not what it seems… 

A Fallen Forest will be free-to-play online
Based on the decline of forest wildlife worldwide, the game will also link real-world wildlife and environmental organisations to a wide and varied global demographic, providing an engaging platform to promote real causes.
The game is a collaboration between myself, Robert T Sharp, a UK Native now living in Ontario, Canada (BBC, UK Film Council) and Italian programmer Davide Beltrame aka Brolyweb (Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Pavesi, Kellogs) along with several globally award winning artists. 
 
Why should I Start Throwing you some Finance?
Simply put: To finish the game. So far I have fully self-funded the project. Because of this, the button of control is with me. I have been able to work with and support a small group of talented individuals from around the world, each of whom deserve to go far and have brought their own style and essence to the project. Gaining the $800 USD needed to complete the game from Indie Gogo would realise not only my vision and effort, but provide the team with a platform from which to build further success. The project has the potential to be enjoyed by literally hundreds of thousands of people world-wide. You have the power to be part of the project and part of that success. 
More specifically your money will go towards creating original, high quality:

Level Maps with Unique Animation 
Character Upgrade Animation 
Sound FX
Why Squirrels?
I'll be honest, they're hilarious.
Characters
Ash

Young, motivated and tactically sound, Ash has spent the last 4 years fighting the on front lines against the Grey Squirrel’s in foreign lands. Grown wise through the horrors of conflict, his military skills have been honed by consistent training and real life combat. His home forest was always too small for him and the only way out was through military conscription. He dreams of exploration, but must head home again before his next adventure…
Silver

 
Newly retired, axe wielding and cheerfully drunk, Silver has had many years of experience on the front lines. Meeting Ash when he first arrived in his regiment, a bond was forged instantly. Heralding from the same forest as Ash and with a palate for drinking only the finest in alcoholic beverages, Silver was looking forward to retiring with his own pub at the heart of the forest community. Until he returned…
Fluffy

 
Rare and unknown. Other forest dwellers know nothing of her kind’s existence and it has remained that way since time immemorial. Comfortably living within the tunnelled and cavernous depths of the land, she has been forced to the surface in search of revenge. Discovering no-one on the surface, she has decided to hide and wait…
Dusk

 
Abandoned at a young age, Dusk’s earliest memory was of her first kill. Starving, cold and without shelter, that first field mouse taught her a valuable lesson. To trust her own instincts. Since then she has remained alone and has perfected her art. She watched the forest grow silent and cherished the solace, until unnatural life began…
Myrm

 
She maintained the connection to her hive for as long as possible. Their voices became increasingly erratic and she couldn’t guide them any longer. Heralding from a long line of powerful wood ant ancestry, for the first time in their history Myrm is forced to move on alone…
Why create A Fallen Forest? 
With a dawning realization. After several years of successfully creating and working on independent film productions (short films, documentaries and a feature film), I was able to transfer my production skills and experience to the interactive sector to create games, which is where my main creative passions thrive. I have an innate desire to create and tell a good story well, and the interactive world opens doors to possibilities you simply cannot achieve within the screen sector.
As a fan of Beatrix Potter, I’ve always wanted to create a darker twisted world with members of the animal kingdom as protagonists. A Fallen Forest is that world.  
The huge and varied demographic free small games like A Fallen Forest have throughout the world allow a fantastic platform for real-world causes. This project is my 'prototype' in providing exposure to issues related to the game.
A Fallen Forest is also one way of respecting the Darwinian struggle of... squirrels... with Shakespearean gravitas while creating an awesome interactive graphic novel/tower defense hybrid of a game for thousands of people to enjoy.
Tell more more… 
A Fallen Forest in this first-step flash-game form, is a work of primarily 2 pieces: 
An Interactive Graphic Novel… 
Influenced in my early years by the work of Neil Gaiman (in particular ‘The Sandman Chronicles’) among others, a graphic novel-esq format was the perfect choice to tell this particular story and for flash games due to file size restrictions for where the game will eventually end up. The interactive graphic novel in combination with the game gives it a unique platform for story-telling.

 …And Tower Defense Game
One of the most popular genres of free online games there is. I remember playing with enthusiasm the custom Tower Defence maps people had created for Blizzard’s Starcraft way back when. Influences in the flash form come from Game in Bottle’s Gemcraft series, Ironhide’s Kingdom Rush and Iriysoft’s Cursed Treasure. 
For those not in the know, the basic premise of a tower defense game is simple: Stop things attacking your stuff. 
Gameplay
You control up to 3 characters of 5 in defending yourselves against an undead threat, interwoven within the storyline. Each character has unique abilities and each team of characters you choose means creating different tactics to combat your enemies. 

Soundtrack
One of my personal highlights for the project to date is having the UK’s greatest modern Metal band Sylosis provide the soundtrack to A Fallen Forest from their album Edge of the Earth, courtesy of Nuclear Blast Records. They have just released their new album Monolith and will be touring the US (supporting Lamb of God) until the 16th of December 2012. 

Stretch Goals
There is so much more we could do with additional funding, but I won't jump the gun just yet...
Where is A Fallen Forest going? What’s in store for the Future? 
Once the game has been completed, it will be launched online for anyone to play for free. From here, it will be further developed for mobile devices. The game is first chapter in the world of A Fallen Forest. I am also writing an ebook exploring in more detail the origin of the characters, which those who pledge $15  and up will receive upon completion in early 2013. Further chapters of the game will follow with enhanced game mechanics, art and animation. All of this depends on your support.

<p>Because we are a small team and we want to give each section of the game special polishing attention, the game will be split into 5 chapters. Your choices and personality will be carried over from one chapter to the next.</p>
<p>Each chapter will be around an hour and a half of play time.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 is planned for early access and testing in October 2016, and for release in December. From there on, a new chapter should be ready every 3 months.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 1 - Descension</b> (October/December 2016)</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2 - Reverie</b> (Winter/Spring 2017)</p>

</div></div>","Thanks to the support of the community, this visual novel is now released! It's available as a PC game for Windows, Linux and Mac OS, on Steam and itch.io.You can find our store pages here:http://store.steampowered.com/app/578900/https://rollingcrown.itch.io/demonheartFeatures
Female protagonist.
Immersive conversations with multiple choices.
Friendships, romances or love-hate relationships with other characters.
Custom alignment system for the main character, measured by two scales: Good/Evil and Tactful/Defiant. Your alignment shifts depending on the choices you make, and the game reacts to it.
A journal that gets filled with world lore.
A demon talking in your head. 3:)
Intrigue and betrayal.
Grey morality.
Secret endings.
Replayability value.
Game resolution is 1920x1080 (widescreen), but it adjusts to fit any screen ratio between 4:3 and 16:9. No FPS limit.
Mature content (17+): bad language, violent themes, graphic blood and gore, sexual references.
  We got accepted on Steam Greenlight! Thanks everyone! Here is what the game currently looks like (though we are planning to add some more features): 
The story
Bright is a young woman from a small, peaceful town. Dark times have come for her family, but luckily, she has the favor of the famous healer-witch Orchid.
 

Benevolent, calm and beloved by all, Orchid hides dark secrets that Bright begins to uncover.

Bright is drawn into a world of darkness and treachery.
 

 
It seems she can never be alone again - for a powerful demonic presence has taken an interest in her activities, and his voice enters her mind at the most inappropriate times.
 
 

 
There are also others who play a significant role in Bright's new life...
 

Ari, a young apprentice witch seduced by bad influences. She tries to be friendly, even though she knows Bright is meant to be her enemy... or is she?
 

Sir Brash, a notorious evil knight who develops a soft spot for Bright, but has a rather special way of showing affection...
 

...and other adorable individuals.
To rebuild her life, Bright has to resolve the situation with her Infernal patron. Will she embrace him, fight him, or decide to merely tolerate him for being a powerful ally?
 

Because we are a small team and we want to give each section of the game special polishing attention, the game will be split into 5 chapters. Your choices and personality will be carried over from one chapter to the next.
Each chapter will be around an hour and a half of play time.
Chapter 1 is planned for early access and testing in October 2016, and for release in December. From there on, a new chapter should be ready every 3 months.
Chapter 1 - Descension (October/December 2016)
Chapter 2 - Reverie (Winter/Spring 2017)
Chapter 3 - Deception (Spring/Summer 2017)
Chapter 4 - Inferno (Summer/Fall 2017)
Chapter 5 - Devotion (Fall/Winter 2017)
 

Jovana: Writer and programmerI have worked on game mods for years before deciding to create a standalone game. I've always wanted to create the kind of characters that were missing in the big developers' games - mostly bad guys to be romanced by the player.
 Radomir: Programmer and technical supportGames have always been my passion and I'm a big technology enthusiast. My current role in life is being a dad and I'm eagerly waiting for my kid to become old enough for us to play and make games together :)
We depend on freelancer talents to produce the game resources, and so far we've funded their work ourselves. Our most reliable associates have been Sibin Aćimović (background artist), Ngô Xuân Hùng (character artist) and Ronggowisnu Prihadi (character animator).
We are so happy with what everyone has accomplished so far, and hope that you can help us to continue funding our amazing artists.

<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
<p>We are based in Perth, Western Australia. Everyone on the design team has either graduated from or are currently studying in a field in the game development industry. We are all passionate about what we do and can't wait to bring our first game to market. This campaign is about the future of the Perth Games market. Have you ever wanted to be part of the beginning of a movement? This may be your opportunity. Most of the team currently work Full Time in other jobs and build this project spare time. What we are finding is licenses for software because what we find is that due to license restrictions on software, we have choke points where work gets tied down. With some extra funding we will purchase more licenses for software that we use to make this game, so that if one person has a heavy workload, others can assist as the company will have more than one license. With you donations we can bring the future of mobile gaming into your hands sooner, and begin the movement towards redefining the industry together.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How much and what you get</h2>

<p>3dS Max floating license - $1505</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Cloud 1 year - $600</p>
<p>All our backers will get beta access. Play the game before we launch in the stores. On launch, all our backers will get free items delivered to inbox dependent on pledge size.

<p> </p>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>Risk 1 - People getting burnt out and the game not finishing</p>
<p>We have experienced this on a small scale getting ready for this campaign. People pushed really hard for 2 weeks in order to get things ready. To counteract this we all take small breaks for a couple of days to gather ourselves. We only work on the project 6 days per week as we all have day jobs so we need time for family and friends. All the staff are invested in the project through the profit sharing model put in place so the entire team feels like it is their project.</p>
<p>Risk 2 - The game not being liked when its released</p>
<p>We will be testing the game at various stages. We already have people lining up to alpha test for us. We are building a community of followers who all want to see us succeed and we have an open door policy. We build games for the player and we actually listen to our players (or future players) when they provide us feedback. Because of this we feel that the game has every chance of being well liked when it is released.</p>
<p>Challenge 1 - The game being too big and taking too long</p>
<p>We have already scaled some thing back to make the deadline for launching this campaign so we understand big scopes. We have management meetings on a regular basis to track progress, we have a structure in place to ensure steady progress and we also have people on standby ready to work for us if we need to. We have put these things in place because we understand that the scope of the game is quite large and we would rather mitigate that now then have no plan and worry about it later.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other ways you can help</h2>
<p>Don't have any spare money to help us on our way? That is absolutely fine. Help us spread the word and any people that do pledge to us and were referred by you, we will offer a special referral bonus to you. While it may not be as large as someone who pledged money, we understand that you have pledged your time so we will also reward you. Just remember to get people to let us know who referred them so we can reach out to you. Facebook, twitter or simply the Indiegogo share tool can all be utilized. This is the one time that gossip is not only liked, its encouraged.</p>

We are Ana, Andrei, Angi, Ela, Ovi and Ralu and we call ourselves #Coubertin's Crew (#GașcaLuiCoubertin) - we proudly take our name from baron Pierre de Coubertin, the father of the Modern Olympic Games. We enjoy volunteering at sporting events and we want to inspire and help others like us discover such opportunities.

Olympic Games volunteers

Once the Modern Olympic Games came to life and spread all over the world, a group called ""Olympic Gypsies"" appeared among the organisers. These people are specialists in fields that are essential for staging the world’s biggest sporting event: the Olympic Games. 

Alongside them people who just wanted to help appeared and so the volunteering phenomenon took off. Today, volunteers are a vital part of organising the Olympic Games. They are praised in all speaches and even take their own oath in the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games.

The Rio 2016 Organising Committee counts on the know-how of 84 modern-day nomads and a big community of volunteers from around the world, a family we are also part of. 

    The Impact

We are #Coubertin's Crew, a group of sport volunteers from Romania passionate about Olympism and its values: excellence, friendship, respect. We aim to create a sport volunteering culture in our country. 

For us, the Olympic Games are a milestone in our journey. On the long term, we want to build a community of sport volunteers and facilitate their participation in sporting competitions. We want to contribute to the organisation of high quality sporting events in Romania, both for competitors and volunteers. This way, athletes will feel the Olympic values from their first competitions and volunteers will be proud to have helped organise them.


Our project started when we found out we were selected as #Rio2016Volunteers. Although we have different experiences, we all strive to educate people in the Olympic spirit and we want to promote sport as a mean of enriching yourself physically, mentally and spiritually.  

Why do we need your support?Being part of #Rio2016 is a great opportunity, but it's also a big financial effort for us. As volunteers, we only receive the uniform, some meals during our shifts and free transportation between venues. Which means that the main costs, the flight tickets and the accommodation in Rio de Janeiro, are our responsibility. We estimated the costs at 3000 euro (3400 dollars)/person and we need your help to raise a part of the money.
 

    Why support us?

All of us have had plenty of volunteering experiences (in NGOs or educational/cultural events), but being part of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games will give us a chance to consolidate our competencies which we will bring to the community of volunteers. By supporting us you will:

make our Olympic dream come true;
catch a glimpse of the Olympics in real-time through our materials (videos, articles);
become an advocate of the Olympic values (excellence, respect, friendship);



contribute to the first community of sport volunteers in Romania.



What do you get?


We hope you will want to join our community of volunteers, tell your friends about us, think about us while watching the Olympic Games and be proud to have helped this initiative. The perks we prepared will connect you to our journey:
As Coubertin's friend you will get to know about our journey to Rio and our experience as volunteers at the Olympic Games through periodic updates. You will support us with 1$.
If you want to be a Supportive Fan, Athlete or Olympian, beside the updates you will get a thank you letter from us. You will support us with 5$, 10$ or 25$.

How else you can help

<h2>WELCOME TO THE CROWD FUNDING CAMPAIGN FOR <em>EXODUS WARS: FRACTURED EMPIRE</em>
</h2>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE: $100 PERK VALUE-ADD—YOUR NAME IN-GAME!</strong></em><br/><em>We've broken through the $1,000 barrier, and we're celebrating by adding <span class=""caps"">EVEN</span> <span class=""caps"">MORE</span> <span class=""caps"">VALUE</span> to the $100 perk! Peeps who buy the $100 perk can have their names in the game! See Update #4 in the Updates tab for details!</em></p>
<p>Hi there! We’re Membraine Studios, and we’re currently developing <strong>a turn-based strategy computer game</strong> set in the distant future, <strong><em>Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire™</em></strong>.</p>
<p><em>Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire</em> is a 3D turn-based strategy game that captures the core gameplay of miniatures wargaming. It puts players at a Brigade level—allowing them to control and manoeuver infantry, armour companies, and massive super-vehicles such as the mighty Marcovian Behemoth on the futuristic battlefields of the Exodus Wars universe.</p>
<p>The vision is that the game will ultimately include an online mode for players who wish to challenge their friends or top strategists in the Exodus Wars community. Individual battles will contribute to the larger conflict, bringing tabletop dynamics to life on a massive scale.</p>
<p>We have put a lot into the game, and we already have a lot of the development work done as you can see from the concept videos (above and <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/90317?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">in the Gallery</a>). Now, though, we need YOU to help us.</p>
<p><span>We have come too far, worked too hard and—to be blunt—spent too much to not make <em>Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire</em>. </span><strong>We will make this game.</strong><span> But will it come out this year? Or will it come out in three years because we had to focus on casual games in order to shore-up our cashflow?</span></p>
<p><span>Only the crowd, the people for whom we're making <em>Fractured Empire</em>, can decide. That's you.</span></p>
<h3><em><img alt=""About exodus Wars Fractured Empire"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff220/Horse3219/membraine/Exodus%20Wars/About-game.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""About exodus Wars Fractured Empire""/></em></h3>
<p>We are huge fans of sci-fi Brigade-level tabletop wargames like <em>Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse</em>, <em>Epic:Armageddon</em>, <em>Future War Commander</em> and <em>Strike Legions</em> (generally called 6mm or microarmour wargames), and we think it’s time the world had a computer game that captures tabletop gaming in all its glory.</p>
<center><img alt=""Ouote"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff220/Horse3219/membraine/Exodus%20Wars/20120516235204-Quote_Red.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Quote""/></center>
<p>We’ve teamed up with Steel Crown Productions, who created the amazing Exodus Wars universe and miniatures, to bring you the essence of tabletop wargaming—strategy, tactics and model collecting—in an online, multi-player computer game. Focussing on strategic manoeuvring and tactical combat, the game will put players in control of infantry and armour companies on the futuristic battlefields of the <em>Exodus Wars</em> universe.</p>
<p><img alt=""tanks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff220/Horse3219/membraine/Exodus%20Wars/EW-Fractured-Empire-Screen-10-Map-2.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""tanks""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fans of miniatures wargames have long lamented the lack of good turn-based strategy computer games, let alone one that appropriately captures the essence of the hobby:</p>
<ul>
<li>the strategy surrounding what units to bring to battle (often called army list development)</li>
<li>the tactics employed on the battlefield to make the most of the chosen strategy</li>
</ul><p>Inspired by great miniatures games like <em>Epic:Armageddon</em> and <em>Future War Commander</em>, <strong><em>Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire</em> will be the computer game tabletop wargamers have always wanted</strong> but have never seen made because wargaming is seen as too niche a market.</p>
<p>We are asking you, the community we hope wants this game as much as we do, to help us fund the rest of the development of <em>Fractured Empire</em> and help ensure it’s the very best game we can make it.</p>
<p>The plan is to initially launch on PC and Mac and, depending on funding levels, mobile platforms like iOS and Android.</p>

<h3><img alt=""What is Exodus Wars"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff220/Horse3219/membraine/Exodus%20Wars/What-is-Exodus-Wars.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""What is Exodus Wars""/></h3>
<p>The <em>Exodus Wars</em> universe is set in the distant future. The feudal Royal Empire of Man, formed long ago as humanity spread far and wide among the stars, is collapsing.</p>
<p>The Royal Empire once had a worthy goal—to see humans achieve Ascendance unto godhood. This goal became known as the Cause.</p>
<p>The Cause had such momentum that it saw humanity spread throughout the galaxy; however, the good will in the human populace built by the once-noble Cause has been squandered thanks to the aristocracy's greed and over-taxation.</p>
<p>The merchant class and those of a capitalist bent seceded with the planetary systems of the 13th Kingdom, and so the Guild was founded as an independent state.</p>
<p>Such secessions represent the greatest threat to an empire, and so the Royal Empire of Man cracked down on the secessionists of the Guild, starting a civil war that would define that period in history.</p>
<p>This period—the Royal Empire’s last gasps as it desperately tries to hold itself together—is known as the Exodus Wars.</p>
<p><img alt=""Prefect line up"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff220/Horse3219/membraine/Exodus%20Wars/Prefect-Line-up.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Prefect line up""/></p>
<p><strong>The Royal Empire of Man vs. the Guild</strong><br/>The Royal Empire, for all its vast industry and near-unlimited supply of soldiers, is nonetheless hampered by the logistical requirements of interstellar warfare and finds itself unable to bring its full force to bear.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the far less numerous but more flexible and better equipped Guild armies are now brimming with well-trained veterans thanks to the significant survivability benefits afforded their troops by their better weaponry and high-tech armour.</p>
<p><strong>Alien Races</strong><br/>The Exodus Wars universe also boasts a plethora of alien races, both those already released by Steel Crown Productions and those in development, adding even greater depth to the game's rich background.</p>
<h3><img alt=""W"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff220/Horse3219/membraine/Exodus%20Wars/Why-We-Love-it.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>We <strong>believe</strong> in the <em>Exodus Wars</em> universe. This is a real, living and breathing universe.</p>
<p>There are great stories to be told here. Tales of epic heroism and unholy deeds. And we can't wait to let you see those stories unfold on your platform of choice.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of games like <em>Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse</em>, <em>Epic:Armageddon</em> or <em>Future War Commander</em>, you will love <em>Fractured Empire</em>.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Why are we making a Turn Based Strategy Game"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff220/Horse3219/membraine/Exodus%20Wars/Why-Are-We-making-a-TBS.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why are we making a Turn Based Strategy Game""/></h3>
<p><strong>Tabletop wargaming is awesome!<br/></strong>At Membraine Studios, we’re all avid tabletop gamers and huge fans of <em>Exodus Wars</em>. And as games developers, we want to bring the <em>Exodus Wars</em> universe to life.</p>
<p>With turn-based gameplay, we can capture the essence of tabletop wargaming, <strong>but add the dynamic and visceral excitement that a computer game can provide</strong>. Seeing and hearing your units move, fire and (frequently!) explode is priceless and an old dream of everyone in the studio.</p>
<p>Playing online, you will be able to <strong>challenge your friends</strong>, or reach out to <strong>challenge the best of the <strong><em>Fractured Empire</em></strong><em> </em>community</strong>—and maybe even contribute to the conflict on a massive scale, depending on how our crowd funding campaign goes.</p>
<p><strong>But what <em>is</em> a tabletop/<strong>miniatures</strong> wargame?</strong><br/><img alt=""Guild MBTs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff220/Horse3219/membraine/Exodus%20Wars/20120408170702-Guild_Exterminators.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Guild MBTs""/>Outside of computer games, wargames are commonly played with miniatures, using physical models of detailed terrain and miniature representations of people and equipment to depict the game state. Common miniatures scales are 28mm, 25mm, 15mm and 6mm.</p>
<p><em>Exodus Wars</em> miniatures are available at both the 28mm and 6mm scale, with corresponding rules for each in active development, but <em>Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire</em> focusses on the 6mm-scale game.</p>
<h3><img alt=""How will it play?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff220/Horse3219/membraine/Exodus%20Wars/How-will-it-play.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""How will it play?""/></h3>
<p><em>Fractured Empire</em> will replicate the tactile nature of tabletop wargaming in a way that no other computer game has to-date. We want the player to be able to pick up the units within a fireteam and move them, just as you would on a real-world tabletop.</p>
<p>The core gameplay of <em>Fractured Empire</em> is still being developed in an iterative process; however, just as the mechanics of all tabletop games differ in some ways and are similar in others but are always familiar thanks to their turn-based nature, so too will <em>Fractured Empire</em> be familiar to new and seasoned wargamers alike.</p>
<p>We're also working very hard to ensure the interface is as intuitive as possible so players can focus on import things like their strategy and tactics.</p>
<p><img alt=""Behemoths approach"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff220/Horse3219/membraine/Exodus%20Wars/EW-Fractured-Empire-Screen-09-Map-2.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Behemoths approach""/></p>
<p><strong>Whether you play games like <em>Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse,</em> <em>Epic:Armageddon</em>,<em> Blitzkrieg Commander</em> and <em>Warmaster </em>or not, we are confident you will pick up the mechanics of <strong><em>Fractured Empire</em></strong> quickly and easily.</strong></p>

<p>Membraine Studios and the guys at Steel Crown Productions started developing <em>Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire</em> some time ago and it's fair to say <strong>we think we are onto something special</strong>.</p>
<p>So far, development is about 40 per cent there, all of which has been funded directly from our own pockets, but we have so many great ideas for the game that we simply can’t afford to fund everything ourselves. To date, we have not found an interested publisher and we have no development deal in sight.</p>
<p>We are incredibly passionate about <em>Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire</em>, its universe and its characters, but unfortunately it is also a very niche game. It's not the next <em>Battlefield</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em>; it sits in a genre that is not considered a sure thing to sell in the industry.</p>
<p>Nonttheless, we believe this game needs to be made, and gamers need to play it, so we are asking YOU to help us make it happen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, crowd funding has come into its own just in time to save this project—and this is where your support comes in.</p>
<p><strong><em>Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire</em> will only exist if you want it to—by contributing to this Indiegogo campaign, you can help make it a reality.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Every cent</strong> will go toward completing <em>Fractured Empire</em>.</p>
<p>We need <strong>$35,000</strong> to complete the game to a Core Game scope—we've expanded on what we mean by that below, and outlined what we would do if we are able to exceed our target.</p>
<p><strong>What would the $35,000 game feature?</strong><br/>This is the Core Game version, which will ship with two limited factions (the Guild vs. the Royal Empire of Man) in a basic infantry and armour only game.</p>
<h3>STRETCH GOALS: WHAT WILL YOU DO IF YOU EXCEED YOUR FUNDING TARGET?</h3>
<p><strong>Every cent</strong> will go toward extending <em>Fractured Empire</em>. Once we have the Core Game in place as described above, the continuing effort is all about adding features, like more unit models, more battlefields, entire new armies and better AI.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Stretch Goal #1: What <strong>would </strong>the </strong>$50,000 <strong>game <strong>feature</strong>?</strong></strong><br/>This would be the full Exodus Wars tabletop wargame experience, including Super Vehicles, as well as aircraft and spaceships in support. You would have two complete factions to play with (most likely the Guild and the Royal Empire of Man), at least two battlefields and a Skirmish mode to play against an AI.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Stretch Goal #2: </strong></strong>What would the $100,000 game feature?</strong><br/>If we achieve this level of funding, we will be able to add a tutorial, a full single-player campaign system, team games, more battlefields and more factions, like the Khazari, the Edenites and the Tarrigin. You would also enjoy a more advanced AI to play against.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Stretch Goal #3: </strong></strong>What would the $150,000 game feature?</strong><br/>If we can achieve $150,000, we will be able to develop iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android versions of the game.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Stretch Goal #4: </strong></strong>What would the $200,000 game feature?</strong><br/>If we achieve this, Membraine will commit to delivering a full multiplayer campaign system—imagine a war spanning a continent or even an entire planet...that's what we foresee in the <em>Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire</em> future. We would create as many different battlefields as possible to ensure variety. The game would also be localised in most “global” languages, including German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese.</p>
<p>What's more, we believe this level of funding would be enough for us to invest in the infrastructure needed to <strong>track the results of each individual skirmish on a real-time map of the galaxy</strong>, so players could see the impact of their efforts on the whole <em>Exodus Wars</em> universe!</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Stretch Goal #5: </strong></strong>What would the $250,000 game feature?</strong><br/>If we can crack $250,000, we will be able to implement <strong>full mod support</strong>. Yes, those creative people who prefer to play in other universes would be able to do so, modding unit stats and even the 3D models themselves to create entirely new experiences.

WELCOME TO THE CROWD FUNDING CAMPAIGN FOR EXODUS WARS: FRACTURED EMPIRE

UPDATE: $100 PERK VALUE-ADD—YOUR NAME IN-GAME!We've broken through the $1,000 barrier, and we're celebrating by adding EVEN MORE VALUE to the $100 perk! Peeps who buy the $100 perk can have their names in the game! See Update #4 in the Updates tab for details!
Hi there! We’re Membraine Studios, and we’re currently developing a turn-based strategy computer game set in the distant future, Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire™.
Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire is a 3D turn-based strategy game that captures the core gameplay of miniatures wargaming. It puts players at a Brigade level—allowing them to control and manoeuver infantry, armour companies, and massive super-vehicles such as the mighty Marcovian Behemoth on the futuristic battlefields of the Exodus Wars universe.
The vision is that the game will ultimately include an online mode for players who wish to challenge their friends or top strategists in the Exodus Wars community. Individual battles will contribute to the larger conflict, bringing tabletop dynamics to life on a massive scale.
We have put a lot into the game, and we already have a lot of the development work done as you can see from the concept videos (above and in the Gallery). Now, though, we need YOU to help us.
We have come too far, worked too hard and—to be blunt—spent too much to not make Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire. We will make this game. But will it come out this year? Or will it come out in three years because we had to focus on casual games in order to shore-up our cashflow?
Only the crowd, the people for whom we're making Fractured Empire, can decide. That's you.

We are huge fans of sci-fi Brigade-level tabletop wargames like Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse, Epic:Armageddon, Future War Commander and Strike Legions (generally called 6mm or microarmour wargames), and we think it’s time the world had a computer game that captures tabletop gaming in all its glory.

We’ve teamed up with Steel Crown Productions, who created the amazing Exodus Wars universe and miniatures, to bring you the essence of tabletop wargaming—strategy, tactics and model collecting—in an online, multi-player computer game. Focussing on strategic manoeuvring and tactical combat, the game will put players in control of infantry and armour companies on the futuristic battlefields of the Exodus Wars universe.

 
Fans of miniatures wargames have long lamented the lack of good turn-based strategy computer games, let alone one that appropriately captures the essence of the hobby:

the strategy surrounding what units to bring to battle (often called army list development)
the tactics employed on the battlefield to make the most of the chosen strategy
Inspired by great miniatures games like Epic:Armageddon and Future War Commander, Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire will be the computer game tabletop wargamers have always wanted but have never seen made because wargaming is seen as too niche a market.
We are asking you, the community we hope wants this game as much as we do, to help us fund the rest of the development of Fractured Empire and help ensure it’s the very best game we can make it.
The plan is to initially launch on PC and Mac and, depending on funding levels, mobile platforms like iOS and Android.

The Exodus Wars universe is set in the distant future. The feudal Royal Empire of Man, formed long ago as humanity spread far and wide among the stars, is collapsing.
The Royal Empire once had a worthy goal—to see humans achieve Ascendance unto godhood. This goal became known as the Cause.
The Cause had such momentum that it saw humanity spread throughout the galaxy; however, the good will in the human populace built by the once-noble Cause has been squandered thanks to the aristocracy's greed and over-taxation.
The merchant class and those of a capitalist bent seceded with the planetary systems of the 13th Kingdom, and so the Guild was founded as an independent state.
Such secessions represent the greatest threat to an empire, and so the Royal Empire of Man cracked down on the secessionists of the Guild, starting a civil war that would define that period in history.
This period—the Royal Empire’s last gasps as it desperately tries to hold itself together—is known as the Exodus Wars.

The Royal Empire of Man vs. the GuildThe Royal Empire, for all its vast industry and near-unlimited supply of soldiers, is nonetheless hampered by the logistical requirements of interstellar warfare and finds itself unable to bring its full force to bear.
Meanwhile, the far less numerous but more flexible and better equipped Guild armies are now brimming with well-trained veterans thanks to the significant survivability benefits afforded their troops by their better weaponry and high-tech armour.
Alien RacesThe Exodus Wars universe also boasts a plethora of alien races, both those already released by Steel Crown Productions and those in development, adding even greater depth to the game's rich background.

We believe in the Exodus Wars universe. This is a real, living and breathing universe.
There are great stories to be told here. Tales of epic heroism and unholy deeds. And we can't wait to let you see those stories unfold on your platform of choice.
If you are a fan of games like Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse, Epic:Armageddon or Future War Commander, you will love Fractured Empire.

Tabletop wargaming is awesome!At Membraine Studios, we’re all avid tabletop gamers and huge fans of Exodus Wars. And as games developers, we want to bring the Exodus Wars universe to life.
With turn-based gameplay, we can capture the essence of tabletop wargaming, but add the dynamic and visceral excitement that a computer game can provide. Seeing and hearing your units move, fire and (frequently!) explode is priceless and an old dream of everyone in the studio.
Playing online, you will be able to challenge your friends, or reach out to challenge the best of the Fractured Empire community—and maybe even contribute to the conflict on a massive scale, depending on how our crowd funding campaign goes.
But what is a tabletop/miniatures wargame?Outside of computer games, wargames are commonly played with miniatures, using physical models of detailed terrain and miniature representations of people and equipment to depict the game state. Common miniatures scales are 28mm, 25mm, 15mm and 6mm.
Exodus Wars miniatures are available at both the 28mm and 6mm scale, with corresponding rules for each in active development, but Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire focusses on the 6mm-scale game.

Fractured Empire will replicate the tactile nature of tabletop wargaming in a way that no other computer game has to-date. We want the player to be able to pick up the units within a fireteam and move them, just as you would on a real-world tabletop.
The core gameplay of Fractured Empire is still being developed in an iterative process; however, just as the mechanics of all tabletop games differ in some ways and are similar in others but are always familiar thanks to their turn-based nature, so too will Fractured Empire be familiar to new and seasoned wargamers alike.
We're also working very hard to ensure the interface is as intuitive as possible so players can focus on import things like their strategy and tactics.

Whether you play games like Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse, Epic:Armageddon, Blitzkrieg Commander and Warmaster or not, we are confident you will pick up the mechanics of Fractured Empire quickly and easily.
We are aiming for strategic and tactical depth, though. Make the right decisions, plan your moves and execute at the right moment, and you will be rewarded.

Membraine Studios and the guys at Steel Crown Productions started developing Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire some time ago and it's fair to say we think we are onto something special.
So far, development is about 40 per cent there, all of which has been funded directly from our own pockets, but we have so many great ideas for the game that we simply can’t afford to fund everything ourselves. To date, we have not found an interested publisher and we have no development deal in sight.
We are incredibly passionate about Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire, its universe and its characters, but unfortunately it is also a very niche game. It's not the next Battlefield or Call of Duty; it sits in a genre that is not considered a sure thing to sell in the industry.
Nonttheless, we believe this game needs to be made, and gamers need to play it, so we are asking YOU to help us make it happen.
Thankfully, crowd funding has come into its own just in time to save this project—and this is where your support comes in.
Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire will only exist if you want it to—by contributing to this Indiegogo campaign, you can help make it a reality.

Every cent will go toward completing Fractured Empire.
We need $35,000 to complete the game to a Core Game scope—we've expanded on what we mean by that below, and outlined what we would do if we are able to exceed our target.
What would the $35,000 game feature?This is the Core Game version, which will ship with two limited factions (the Guild vs. the Royal Empire of Man) in a basic infantry and armour only game.
STRETCH GOALS: WHAT WILL YOU DO IF YOU EXCEED YOUR FUNDING TARGET?
Every cent will go toward extending Fractured Empire. Once we have the Core Game in place as described above, the continuing effort is all about adding features, like more unit models, more battlefields, entire new armies and better AI.
Stretch Goal #1: What would the $50,000 game feature?This would be the full Exodus Wars tabletop wargame experience, including Super Vehicles, as well as aircraft and spaceships in support. You would have two complete factions to play with (most likely the Guild and the Royal Empire of Man), at least two battlefields and a Skirmish mode to play against an AI.
Stretch Goal #2: What would the $100,000 game feature?If we achieve this level of funding, we will be able to add a tutorial, a full single-player campaign system, team games, more battlefields and more factions, like the Khazari, the Edenites and the Tarrigin. You would also enjoy a more advanced AI to play against.
Stretch Goal #3: What would the $150,000 game feature?If we can achieve $150,000, we will be able to develop iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android versions of the game.
Stretch Goal #4: What would the $200,000 game feature?If we achieve this, Membraine will commit to delivering a full multiplayer campaign system—imagine a war spanning a continent or even an entire planet...that's what we foresee in the Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire future. We would create as many different battlefields as possible to ensure variety. The game would also be localised in most “global” languages, including German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese.
What's more, we believe this level of funding would be enough for us to invest in the infrastructure needed to track the results of each individual skirmish on a real-time map of the galaxy, so players could see the impact of their efforts on the whole Exodus Wars universe!
Stretch Goal #5: What would the $250,000 game feature?If we can crack $250,000, we will be able to implement full mod support. Yes, those creative people who prefer to play in other universes would be able to do so, modding unit stats and even the 3D models themselves to create entirely new experiences. We cut our teeth in modding, and we are 100% supportive of actively developing a modding community for Fracture Empire. (And we want to play mods too!)
Every Dollar Will Make Fracture Empire More AwesomeEvery dollar that is contributed will take us that much closer to being able to:

Create even more maps and environments

Add important features and customisation options

WHO ARE MEMBRAINE STUDIOS?
Membraine Studios is currently a three-man team based in Sydney, Australia: Glenn, Josh and Mark. We love games in all forms, but we have big dreams for the Turn-Based Strategy (TBS) genre in particular.
As keen wargamers and hobbyists, the Exodus Wars universe is in safe hands.
Coding since the age of 11, Josh cut his teeth modding Quake 2 and 3 during his mid-teens.  Ever since, he’s been addicted to the code, developing extensive experience as a Software Engineer working on leading-edge biomedical and telecommunications devices. Josh founded Membraine Studios with Mark and Glenn in 2009 to develop Orbital Defence for iPhone.
Glenn is an artist and qualified architect. He has spent the last 6 years working with several architectural firms, but his true love is digital art, 3D modelling and animation in the game space, which he has been doing for more than 10 years. Glenn’s extensive experience with 3D modelling tools for architecture enabled him to transition seamlessly into games development. Glenn also brings extensive music and sound effects production experience.
Mark is a veteran of the IT industry with more than 17 years experience in software production (predominantly in business administration and project management). Mark entered the games development space in 2009 when he founded Membraine Studios with Josh and Glenn.
The Membraine team are also proud members of the crowd funding community, having sponsored several Indiegogo and Kickstarter projects (you can follow Mark on Kickstarter, for example, at kickstarter.com/profile/gr00v3r):

The company specialises in fine-detail models, and is renowned for being among the first indie miniatures producers to use the latest 3D printing technologies for its 6mm and 28mm ranges.

<p>For the past two years I've been working on a 2D game engine and physics simulation system in my spare time. It supports many kinds of 2D games and it's fully platform independent.</p>
<p>The first game I want to create with it is a space exploration game in the spirit of Elite/Frontier, but in 2D. It will feature gameplay on different scales.

<p>Programming, design, graphics, sound and music are all done by one person, to create a deep gaming experience that is truly unique.</p>
<p>I'm currently finishing up the technology, so the actual game is shown in an early stage of development. I think I need about a year to actually complete it.</p>
<p>My aim with this campaign is to generate interest in the project, to make it known to the world. I'm working on this in my spare time, so that's where the money comes from for now, but maybe if I gather enough support I might make the jump to working on this fulltime.</p>

1. How to play RiderState
We think that the best way to explain how the game works is to show you a brief demo:

RiderState is a very intuitive game. Just gear up, hop on your bike and turn on the app, as soon as you do, your smartphone GPS will collect the information the game needs about your current location and you are ready to go.RiderState's main features are:

Game board: Riderstate divides the world into 10,000 m² zones, each of which represents a potential territory to be conquered. 

Route tracking: Smartphone GPS technology enables RiderState to gather important information regarding your location, speed, distance, altitude, etc. at each time, record it. RiderState analyzes this information and applies different algorithms which determine your final score. Users can compare this score to users in the rest of the world. 
My Territories dashboard: Users can keep track of the different scores and conquered territories by accessing the “My territories dashboard” in in app menu.
Play against other world players or create a closed group with your friends and keep the competition private. 2. The RiderState plotA big
change is silently taking place…""The Bicycle Revolution""The RidersCitizens become warriors ready to work together and fight for a common goal: to conquer the world on their bikes!The CorporationEach Rider will compete to become the governor of his street, neighborhood or city, and implement a bike riding policy.However, it will not be easy. ""The Corporation"", an industrial lobby with a strong political influence, will do its best to keep the status quo and maintain its control of the worlds transportation habitsThe ClansRiders all have a common goal but are divided into different social groups called ¨clans¨. Clan leaders will have the responsibility and honor of representing the rest of the Clan members when planning strategies in the RiderState virtual world.3.

We have already developed an alpha version of the app with the basic features, but, we need your contribution to maintaining and improve RiderState.We will use your money for:

We also need to promote the game worldwide, in order to improve the experience for everyone. The value of the game and the experience it offers players increases with every additional user.The next figure shows the strategy we will follow depending on the level of funding we are able to achieve:We won’t forget our commitment: if we are able to raise at least $24000, we will donate 3% to the World Bicycle Relief.At RiderState we are aware that bicycles are a luxury in many countries. World Bicycle Relief is an NGO that meets the growing demand for high-quality bicycles in the developing world. Since 2005, World Bicycle Relief has provided over 120,000 bicycles to more than 13 countries in Africa and South Asia.4. Rewards delivery5. What if we do not reach the goal?We are fully confident, and we will work for 1000% in order to reach the goal. However, we have chosen the flexible crowdfunding mode, so if we don't reach the campaign target, we pledge to release a powerful game, removing certain features in order to get a live app on February 2014.Be assured that regardless of the campaign result, we will deliver the full rewards to our backers.6.

<p>We have been working on Grush for 8 months and have already developed the Grush prototype hardware and alpha Grush Games.   We have proved that our motion sensing technology can detect brushing movements precisely. We have partnered with a world class mobile gaming studio, Threadbare Games to develop compelling Grush games to be available at launch.</p><p>Grush won the First Prize award at the TEEC Cup / North America Chinese Startup and Talent Summit out of 500 companies nationwide in Jan 2014 Grush presented to an audience of over 1000 people at the Santa Clara Convention Center. The judges were from major VCs in the US and China. The responses from the judges and audience were overwhelmingly enthusiastic.  This not only gave us good exposure to the investment community but also gave us a first hand market response for our product.</p><p>This technology was invented and is developed in the USA. A patent covering the technology has been filed in the US and internationally. </p><p>Though the idea is innovative, the components are based on matured technology.   This means the technology risk is well controlled.  We have more than 30 years experience in managing complex manufacturing projects. While all projects entail risk, we have done everything possible to mitigate any potential risk to a very low level.</p>

Interactive Gamification: 
Grush Apps are interactive games and apps that receive motion data from the Grush Brush and integrate it with a simulated image of teeth or any game theme. The games are designed to guide children to brush properly according to the American Dental Association’s child brushing recommendations. The child can battle monsters, fly spaceships, or ride a pony, all while being instructed in the ideal brush position and duration of brushing. Peace of Mind: The Grush Cloud stores statistical brushing data for parental tracking / monitoring. The Parental Dashboard App is used to track kids' brushing over time and reward them accordingly. We are the Grush team.   Grush, Inc. is San Francisco based start-up dedicated to improve the oral health of children through innovative technology. Grush, Inc. is a member of Wearable World, a highly selective accelerator for wearable and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, located in San Francisco.

We have been working on Grush for 8 months and have already developed the Grush prototype hardware and alpha Grush Games.   We have proved that our motion sensing technology can detect brushing movements precisely. We have partnered with a world class mobile gaming studio, Threadbare Games to develop compelling Grush games to be available at launch.Grush won the First Prize award at the TEEC Cup / North America Chinese Startup and Talent Summit out of 500 companies nationwide in Jan 2014 Grush presented to an audience of over 1000 people at the Santa Clara Convention Center. The judges were from major VCs in the US and China. The responses from the judges and audience were overwhelmingly enthusiastic.  This not only gave us good exposure to the investment community but also gave us a first hand market response for our product.This technology was invented and is developed in the USA. A patent covering the technology has been filed in the US and internationally. Though the idea is innovative, the components are based on matured technology.   This means the technology risk is well controlled.  We have more than 30 years experience in managing complex manufacturing projects. While all projects entail risk, we have done everything possible to mitigate any potential risk to a very low level.

<p>Lackadaisy Shores is an up and coming virtual pet/community site with
 a focus on creativity, casual play and mobile accessibility.  While 
playing, users will be able to design and submit their own pets, play 
games, and interact with others in the community!  Our goal for the site
 is to work off of the input of the community as it forms, and put more 
content out based on what users are interested in seeing.</p>
<p>Right 
now we are hard at work to make this a site that caters to veterans of 
the virtual pet site community, as well as making a site that will be 
welcoming to those who are just starting out!  We have a lot of things 
planned for giving everyone something to look forward to while playing.</p>
<p>All of us hope you'll join in on making Lackadaisy Shores a place for everyone to enjoy!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In order to make Lackadaisy Shores a bigger and better site for everyone, there is a lot that needs to be done!  To give the users the best possible experience and enjoy being on the site, we would like to upgrade to a better hosting plan in order to accommodate the amount of users that will be active on the site at any given time.  Your contributions will go directly towards that, and also funding all sorts of new content; games, guilds, and more!</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, every little bit helps!  Creating a website like Lackadaisy Shores is very expensive, and we will be doing our very best to ensure that the site will be one our users will come back too.  All funding will go towards making the website one to enjoy!  <br/></p>
<p>For the duration of this fundraiser, we will be offering the following perks:</p> <ul>
<li>Donator's Trophy - These would go out to everyone who donated!<br/>
</li> <li>Early Bird Access - Get access to the site one week before it opens!<br/>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Lackadaisy Shores is an up and coming virtual pet/community site with
 a focus on creativity, casual play and mobile accessibility.  While 
playing, users will be able to design and submit their own pets, play 
games, and interact with others in the community!  Our goal for the site
 is to work off of the input of the community as it forms, and put more 
content out based on what users are interested in seeing.
Right 
now we are hard at work to make this a site that caters to veterans of 
the virtual pet site community, as well as making a site that will be 
welcoming to those who are just starting out!  We have a lot of things 
planned for giving everyone something to look forward to while playing.
All of us hope you'll join in on making Lackadaisy Shores a place for everyone to enjoy!

   What We Need & What You Get In order to make Lackadaisy Shores a bigger and better site for everyone, there is a lot that needs to be done!  To give the users the best possible experience and enjoy being on the site, we would like to upgrade to a better hosting plan in order to accommodate the amount of users that will be active on the site at any given time.  Your contributions will go directly towards that, and also funding all sorts of new content; games, guilds, and more!
Even if we don't reach our goal, every little bit helps!  Creating a website like Lackadaisy Shores is very expensive, and we will be doing our very best to ensure that the site will be one our users will come back too.  All funding will go towards making the website one to enjoy!  
For the duration of this fundraiser, we will be offering the following perks: 
Donator's Trophy - These would go out to everyone who donated!
 Early Bird Access - Get access to the site one week before it opens!
 Lots of exclusive items and even getting a pet designed for you!

</p><p>During the 9 months that Autcraft has been online we have whitelisted over 3,600
children and adults--far more than Stuart ever anticipated playing on
the server. After having Paul Soares, Jr. (a well-known Minecraft YouTuber) stop by, our group grew exponentially. After Autism Speaks shared a story about us on Facebook, our group grew even more. While all of this growth is exciting and very welcome, the current server
 has reached its limits and we are finding it necessary to upgrade. <br/></p><p>In addition to at least one new server, there are several plugins that we would like to add that would 
enhance the experience for the children. We would also like to be able 
to provide funds to Stuart who spends most of his waking moments either 
on Autcraft or monitoring chat, as well as some  of the admins—many of 
whom are on over 8 hours a day. </p><p>Unfortunately, we are also often faced with children who need a great deal of help and are having thoughts of hurting themselves. We would like to be able train the  Autcraft admins and helpers to be able to handle these situations effectively.<br/></p>

Specifically, we are looking to obtain:<p></p><ul>
<li>A second server, possibly in Europe, that would cost $200/ month; and possibly a third in the not-to-distant future.</li>
<li>Funds to assist Stuart in running these servers full-time.</li>
<li>Additional personnel to help run the servers so that there is a near-constant presence of admin help available to the children.<br/>
</li>
<li>Several plugins: Plugin development runs about $1K per plugin as we often have
 specific requirements that don't currently meet the standards of those currently available.</li>
<li>We would like to enlist the aid of trained staff such as hotline/crisis/suicide prevention personnel to either help us directly on the server, or to train the admins so that they are able to handle these crises effectively and safely on their own.<br/>

<p>OddPlanet is a side-scrolling game about exploration and puzzle solving. You will guide a lone little girl through the hostile environments of an alien planet and help her survive.</p>
<p>We are strongly focused on intelligent puzzles and the highest quality of art. The puzzles will be challenging for the casual gamer and refreshing for the hardcore gamer. We want to create a living world for you to explore and admire. As you play, our girl lost in this world will interact with it and share her feelings about it with you.</p>

<p>There are not enough unique, intelligent, and atmospheric games available and there is much space for such titles. Our game will not be about killing monsters or jumping fast.

<p>We’ve been working on OddPlanet for some time and here you can see what we accomplished so far. We plan to finish the game three months after the end of our successful campaign on Indiegogo. We need addictional funding to keep that deadline. Without your support, we won’t be able to complete our task in reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>Our goal is $30k and, if we achieve that, we will be able to focus on development and cover necessary expenses on advertising. If we exceed that goal - Don’t worry, we won’t waste your money! We also have additional, bigger plan. OddPlanet will have a soundtrack created by one of the most well-known dark ambient musicians, Atrium Carceri. We have spoken with the artist and he agreed to create music for our game.</p>
<p>If our campaign proves to be more successful than we ever imagined, additional money will be spent on creating more content, creating an even bigger and longer game that we will divide into parts. We will also create versions not only for Windows and Ios, but also for Xbox, Android and other platforms.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><em><br/><br/>We have elastic funding on Indiegogo - so if you hesitate to support us, because you don't know if we will reach our goal, you don't have to resign. Every dollar counts. We will get money even if we won't acheive our goal.</em></h3>

The last year has been a very learnful experience and I've met some great people along the way. For me the highlights were commissioning my first sculpt, the Hogman, done by Paul Muller and getting a chance to get my hands on the rights and moulds for the orcs formerly owned by Fictive Miniatures and launching the Indiegogo campaign. Ironically the downside was that same campaign which failed to reach its target. Luckily I was able to find the funds to complete the transaction and get them anyway. The backers who did pledge, I will be eternally grateful to, and I still can't wait to see some paintjobs by them on the orcs and more particular the Hogman! HINT! </p>
<p>You might have noticed there hasn't been a lot of activity regarding Oddity. There are several reasons for this but the most important one is that I simply lacked funds to commission more sculpts and get the moulds done for the paladin and demon/zombie. Ideas a plenty, just not enough money to realize them. Combine that with lots of study work for my main income job, family life and some other things and Oddity basically has come to a stand still.<br/> <br/>''Haven't I done anything during those long months then?!'' I hear you say No, far from it actually! One of things I love to do most is creating 'things'. Ideas for miniatures, games and generally whole concepts. One of the bigger projects I had lying around for years is a project called Machine Feud. A game which involves big piloted robotic suits called mecha. It was one of those things too big to handle all by myself and it just got 'stored' for a later date when I would have a chance to do something with it rpoperly. One of the great new friends I've made along the way is Paolo J L. Tarkov who is a great sculptor. He felt bored at one point during the summer and we looked if we could do something together. That thing quickly became Machine Feud. We've started the project a while ago along with another great guy, Anto Cerrato who is taking a crack at a ruleset for the mechs/game. We are taking our time with it but if you want to check it out you can do so here! </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MachineFeud?hc_location=timeline"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/MachineFeud?hc_location=timeline</a><br/> <br/>''What does that got to do with Oddity?!'' I hear you say once again? Well, I was contacted by Sally White of Hasslefree Miniatures with an offer to buy me out. I was really suprised about this offer and while it never was my intention to sell Oddity, I have decided to do so after a very long and hard think. I see this not as a failure, but as a chance to start over with the new knowledge in mind and which pitfalls to avoid, etc etc... After some initial hick ups due to Sally's health and busy family life things got sorted really quickly at the end of december/beginning of january and I would really like to thank Artemis Black for this! To check out the new owners of the Oddity range simply visit this link!<br/> <br/><a href=""http://www.hfminis.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.hfminis.co.uk/</a><br/> <br/>Besides concentrating more on Machine Feud I can also anounce I will be working together with Ian 'Geronimo' Brumby of Fenris Games fame. Ian is a seasoned veteran of the hobby and is an established name in the games industry. Besides working on exiting new ranges, I will also be aiding him in further developing his existing ranges as well as doing some marketing &amp; sales thingies! </p>

<p><strong>Update 14! Everything has been shipped!!!</strong></p>
<p>As of today all outstanding pledges have been shipped and should be arriving with you shortly! I'd appreciate it if you let me know when you've received the package and what you think of them! (same goes for pics of when you painted them! ;) )</p>
<p>I'll be writing a last update shortly about my experience and what I could've done better, what went wel etc...</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Update 13! The Hogman has arrived!!!</strong></p>
<p>I just got a parcel in from Griffin Moulds containing the Hogman casts! I will add them to the packages for the remaining backers who had to wait for hoggie to arrive and I will ship them this week. Seeing most packages already sent took about a week to reach various destinations I am guessing you'll get yours soon! :)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Update 12! Orcs are coming your way!</strong></p>
<p>So I got this nice bunch of orcs in and the Hogman is being moulded as we speak! </p>
<p>I've packed the orders that included only orcs and they are ready for shipment. So unfortunatly if you also ordered a Hogman too you will have to wait just a little bit longer (not much though I reckon!) untill they arrive here but if you 'only' ordered orcs your order should be arriving soon! ;)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Update 11: What now?!</strong></p>
<p>I meant to write this update sooner but unfortunatly family life came in between and to be honest I need some time to get myself together a bit. On one side I am very happy with the support you, the backers, have given me! On the other side I did expect more out of this campaign to be quite honest! </p>
<p>In hindsight I have made a big error. Going with Flexible funding instead of Fixed because I thought it didn't make that much difference. Especially since I had 100% faith we would reach our target. I understand completly that people are weary of backing a project which works this way and I will never be doing that again. </p>
<p>Now we come to the important part that is fullfilling this campaign. First I need to pay Ryan and make sure the moulds and rights are transferred to me. As it now stands I am awaiting his details so I can wire him the amount. I have had contact with the caster's too and as soon as they receive the moulds they can start the casting part. The Hogman should be moulded this week also so if all goes to plan the orcs and hoggie should be casted along the same time. </p>
<p>They have a turnaround of about three weeks and get it shipped to me. Then I would need some time to sort them and package them. Now the plus side is that because there aren't that many backers I should get all this done relatively quickly! See, I'm already back to my positive self again! ;-) </p>
<p>Anyone reading this and who thinks ''why am I too late, I sooo wanted these too!'' can still do so by contacting me here or through my Facebook page;</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oddity/249951758349014?hc_location=timeline"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oddity/249951758349014?hc_location=timeline</a></p>
<p>You better hurry though because as soon as I have given Griffin the order to get started, I am not adding more to the number of casts. Since I have to eat in to my funds (which were meant to pay for the other moulds and sculpts) it could take a long time before these orcs and the Hogman hit the market in a regular way!!!</p>
<p>Lastly I want to thank the backers one more time! Without your awesome support I would never have been able to buy the orcs! Thanks alot, you rock!!!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Tim Jonker / Oddity Miniatures</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Update 10: Last update! Final hours!!!</strong></p>
<p>Final hours of the campaign and I am very grateful for all the backers on board! You are all awesome!!! :D</p>
<p>Please anyone reading this call up your mates and let them back if you think they are missing out! Then of course have them pester anyone else they know and let them back too!!! :P</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Update 9: Only three days left! Painted perks levels made more affordable!</strong></p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just a little under three days left <strong>(68 hours to be precise!)</strong> and I am really grateful for the support I've been getting from you all! I hope that in the remaining we can end as high as posible!</p>
<p>This brings me to a point that had been raised on several occassions and a valid one at that! I have made the mistake to go with 'Flexible Funding' and it seems this has hurt the campaign somewhat. At the time I didn't think much of it to be honest. I thought we would reach the goal so didn't think of the concequences of the possibilty if we didn't reach it! I understand why people might be hesitant to back because they might think when the goal isn't reached they somehow won't get what they paid for!</p>
<p><strong>I can tell you this won't be the case!!! I have found someone really generous who will loan me the difference so I will be able to deliver no matter what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>This was always the case but at first it might have been the case that it would take just a little longer. The caster has given me a great forecast too so I expect I can deliver very soon after the campaign has ended!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Painted perks! Prices lowered!</strong></p>
<p>I've lowered the prices on the painted perks. I hope this will make them more attractive for people who've been thinking about buying them but couldn't afford them or thought the prices were too high.</p>
<p>Paul Sanderson really is a great painter and a very good man! I cannot thank him enough for being such a great help and friend!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Update 8: Only six days left! Please pledge now!!!</strong></p>
<p>Hi all, only six days left before this campaign ends! I know we won't make the € 1.500 goal but I do hope we can end as high as possible! So please I ask you once more, please share the campaign on your homepage, Facebook, favourite forum or blog! Or better, please make a contribution and help me reach as high as possible!!!</p>
<p>Meanwhile Paul Sanderson has sent me the picture of the remaining two orcs! Check the gallery for the pics!</p>
<p><strong>Update 6: The end is fast approaching!</strong></p>
<p>Little under two weeks to go! Hope people who have been thinking to pledge do so fast!</p>
<p>Paul Sanderson just send me a pic of the first two Orcs he has painted! If you want to own a couple of very nice painted Orcs yourself then please pledge!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Update 5! The arrival of the Hogman!!!</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people have asked me if I can include the Hogman into this campaign and while this was not originally intended (or calculated for that matter!), I have decided to do so! 'Cause quite honestly, we are not going that fast! So I hope this new add-on will gain us more backers and we will still be able to reach our goal. And hopefully a bit more...?!</p>
<p><strong>Hogman.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Painted Hogman:</strong></p>
<p>The Hogman you see above is painted by Paul Sanderson and if you would like to own a Hogman painted by him then you can do so by pledging for one. Remember there are only 10 of these available so if you want one you better be fast before they are gone!</p>
<p>Please help me and share the news but more importantly back! ;)</p>
<p>Thanks!!!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Update 4! New perks, painted miniatures!!!</strong></p>
<p>I’ve got some pretty exiting news to share with you and that is you can now get the Orc miniatures painted by Paul Sanderson, a very talented and really great painter. He has joined forces with me and agreed to do the painting side of things. This means you now have the chance to have some really good paintjobs to add to your collection!</p>
<p>Paul will work with you to establish your preferred colourscheme and wishes so let’s say if you simply don’t have the time to paint, or are just maybe not that good at it and would like to own some quality artworks then here is your chance!!!</p>
<p>See the update section for more!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 3:Orc Warrior versatility!</strong></p>
<p>I've had some feedback that people are a bit worried that when they get the Orc Horde perk that they will get the same Orc warriors/poses. I can tell you that you don't have to worry as the arms are interchangeable!!! This means you can get quite some variety and your Horde will look unique and not to mention quite impressive! ;)</p>
<p>See the updates section to look at the picture!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2:scale comparison pics!</strong></p>
<p>2nd update! This time some scale comparison pictures! Please check out the gallery to seen them!</p>
<p>I would like to thank the backers onboard so far! You guys are awesome!!! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 1:pictures in the gallery!</strong></p>
<p>An update so soon?! Why yes!</p>
<p>It has been pointed out to me that seeing larger pics would really help! I kinda forgot due to my body being pumped full with adrenaline! ;)</p>
<p>Anyhoo, check out the gallery to see the original artworks painted by Chris Southern!</p>

<p><strong>Hi, my name's Tim and I've just started Oddity Miniatures- a new company that will release highly detailed, paintable fantasy miniatures with a dark edge and which can be used for roleplaying and tabletop games.</strong></p>
<p>Recently I came into contact with Ryan, the owner of former Fictive Miniatures. In 2009, Ryan, had a sculptor named Paul Muller create some of best Orc miniatures I have ever seen. Unfortunatly his company did not exist for very long and sadly the small range of Orcs quickly became out of production.</p>
<p>The good news is that Ryan and I have now come to an agreement of me buying the rights and moulds from him so that I can put the Orcs back into production relatively soon! The catch however is that all of my funds are tied up in the sculpts I have commissioned so far for my upcoming range.</p>
<p>That's why I am launching this Indiegogo campaign in order to help me buy the Orcs and I could really use all the help I can get!!! I hope to gather enough funds to pay for the rights plus moulds, and also for new castings of the Orc miniatures. Maybe if we do really well I can even ask Paul to expand the Orc range with a couple of new sculpts!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p>I really need your help to at least reach our main goal. If we reach that I can buy the rights to the Orcs from Ryan/Fictive Miniatures as well as the existing moulds and get new castings made.</p>
<p>In the event of us going over our main goal I will try and get Paul Muller to do some more Orc sculpts! A shaman? or some archers maybe?! Paul is a very busy man however so that could still take a while.  </p>
<p>In return you get some great looking and characterful miniatures of some of the best Orc miniatures ever made! You can get just the Orc Lord or a pack of Orc Warriors or if you want more of them you can go for the larger deals which have even better value!</p>
<p><strong>In case this campaign doesn't reach its funding goal then it doesn't mean you won't get your miniatures! Because they are already made and I love them so much I will get them no matter what! It would only mean it will take a bit longer as I will have to scrounge up more money to send to Ryan. He has already told me he is not in much of a hurry so I can take my time. It goes without saying though that I will do everything to get things done as fast as possible!!!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Perks!</strong></h3>
<p>I've tried to make it as clear as possible and have outlined the different options there are for buying the Orcs! If you have any questions or something isn't clear to you then please don't hesitate to ask!</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: when you make a pledge please make sure that you also include the shipping costs! I'm affraid I cannot send out your orders untill you have paid in full!</strong></p>
<p>The *Orcs in these pictures are sculpted by <strong>Paul Muller</strong> and painted by<strong> Chris Southern</strong>.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help!</h3>

<p>I understand completely that there are some of you out there who really like what they're seeing but just can’t contribute! In this economic climate it is sometimes hard to keep your head above water and I completely understand! That doesn’t mean you can’t help however!</p>
<p>Please help me to get the word out to as many potential backers as possible and share this campaign on any sites, blogs, social media and other ways you know of!!! Be sure to use any of the handy tools Indiegogo provides!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p></span></span></span></span></div>","Update 15: The big announcement! First of all I want to thank everyone who has helped me establish Oddity Miniatures as it has become so far. The last year has been a very learnful experience and I've met some great people along the way. For me the highlights were commissioning my first sculpt, the Hogman, done by Paul Muller and getting a chance to get my hands on the rights and moulds for the orcs formerly owned by Fictive Miniatures and launching the Indiegogo campaign. Ironically the downside was that same campaign which failed to reach its target. Luckily I was able to find the funds to complete the transaction and get them anyway. The backers who did pledge, I will be eternally grateful to, and I still can't wait to see some paintjobs by them on the orcs and more particular the Hogman! HINT! 
You might have noticed there hasn't been a lot of activity regarding Oddity. There are several reasons for this but the most important one is that I simply lacked funds to commission more sculpts and get the moulds done for the paladin and demon/zombie. Ideas a plenty, just not enough money to realize them. Combine that with lots of study work for my main income job, family life and some other things and Oddity basically has come to a stand still. ''Haven't I done anything during those long months then?!'' I hear you say No, far from it actually! One of things I love to do most is creating 'things'. Ideas for miniatures, games and generally whole concepts. One of the bigger projects I had lying around for years is a project called Machine Feud. A game which involves big piloted robotic suits called mecha. It was one of those things too big to handle all by myself and it just got 'stored' for a later date when I would have a chance to do something with it rpoperly. One of the great new friends I've made along the way is Paolo J L. Tarkov who is a great sculptor. He felt bored at one point during the summer and we looked if we could do something together. That thing quickly became Machine Feud. We've started the project a while ago along with another great guy, Anto Cerrato who is taking a crack at a ruleset for the mechs/game. We are taking our time with it but if you want to check it out you can do so here! 
https://www.facebook.com/MachineFeud?hc_location=timeline ''What does that got to do with Oddity?!'' I hear you say once again? Well, I was contacted by Sally White of Hasslefree Miniatures with an offer to buy me out. I was really suprised about this offer and while it never was my intention to sell Oddity, I have decided to do so after a very long and hard think. I see this not as a failure, but as a chance to start over with the new knowledge in mind and which pitfalls to avoid, etc etc... After some initial hick ups due to Sally's health and busy family life things got sorted really quickly at the end of december/beginning of january and I would really like to thank Artemis Black for this! To check out the new owners of the Oddity range simply visit this link! http://www.hfminis.co.uk/ Besides concentrating more on Machine Feud I can also anounce I will be working together with Ian 'Geronimo' Brumby of Fenris Games fame. Ian is a seasoned veteran of the hobby and is an established name in the games industry. Besides working on exiting new ranges, I will also be aiding him in further developing his existing ranges as well as doing some marketing & sales thingies! 
More on what we'll be working on later but unnecessary to say I am very, VERY! exited about this!!! Check out Fenris Games here; http://www.fenrisgames.com/home.html 
or here on Facebook; https://www.facebook.com/FenrisGames I hope I have not dissapointed anyone with this move and I am really sorry if I did! I am definitly not out of the industry, better yet! I'll be back better and stronger than ever!

Update 10: Last update! Final hours!!!
Final hours of the campaign and I am very grateful for all the backers on board! You are all awesome!!! :D
Please anyone reading this call up your mates and let them back if you think they are missing out! Then of course have them pester anyone else they know and let them back too!!! :P
 
Update 9: Only three days left! Painted perks levels made more affordable!
Hi all,
Just a little under three days left (68 hours to be precise!) and I am really grateful for the support I've been getting from you all! I hope that in the remaining we can end as high as posible!
This brings me to a point that had been raised on several occassions and a valid one at that! I have made the mistake to go with 'Flexible Funding' and it seems this has hurt the campaign somewhat. At the time I didn't think much of it to be honest. I thought we would reach the goal so didn't think of the concequences of the possibilty if we didn't reach it!

This was always the case but at first it might have been the case that it would take just a little longer. The caster has given me a great forecast too so I expect I can deliver very soon after the campaign has ended!
 
Painted perks! Prices lowered!
I've lowered the prices on the painted perks. I hope this will make them more attractive for people who've been thinking about buying them but couldn't afford them or thought the prices were too high.
Paul Sanderson really is a great painter and a very good man! I cannot thank him enough for being such a great help and friend!!!
 
Update 8: Only six days left! Please pledge now!!!
Hi all, only six days left before this campaign ends! I know we won't make the € 1.500 goal but I do hope we can end as high as possible! So please I ask you once more, please share the campaign on your homepage, Facebook, favourite forum or blog! Or better, please make a contribution and help me reach as high as possible!!!
Meanwhile Paul Sanderson has sent me the picture of the remaining two orcs! Check the gallery for the pics!
Update 6: The end is fast approaching!
Little under two weeks to go! Hope people who have been thinking to pledge do so fast!
Paul Sanderson just send me a pic of the first two Orcs he has painted! If you want to own a couple of very nice painted Orcs yourself then please pledge!

 
Update 5! The arrival of the Hogman!!!
A lot of people have asked me if I can include the Hogman into this campaign and while this was not originally intended (or calculated for that matter!), I have decided to do so! 'Cause quite honestly, we are not going that fast! So I hope this new add-on will gain us more backers and we will still be able to reach our goal. And hopefully a bit more...?!
Hogman.

Hogman Double pack.

The Hogman you see above is painted by Paul Sanderson and if you would like to own a Hogman painted by him then you can do so by pledging for one. Remember there are only 10 of these available so if you want one you better be fast before they are gone!
Please help me and share the news but more importantly back! ;)

UPDATE 3:Orc Warrior versatility!
I've had some feedback that people are a bit worried that when they get the Orc Horde perk that they will get the same Orc warriors/poses. I can tell you that you don't have to worry as the arms are interchangeable!!! This means you can get quite some variety and your Horde will look unique and not to mention quite impressive! ;)
See the updates section to look at the picture!
 
UPDATE 2:scale comparison pics!
2nd update! This time some scale comparison pictures! Please check out the gallery to seen them!
I would like to thank the backers onboard so far! You guys are awesome!!!

Hi, my name's Tim and I've just started Oddity Miniatures- a new company that will release highly detailed, paintable fantasy miniatures with a dark edge and which can be used for roleplaying and tabletop games.
Recently I came into contact with Ryan, the owner of former Fictive Miniatures. In 2009, Ryan, had a sculptor named Paul Muller create some of best Orc miniatures I have ever seen. Unfortunatly his company did not exist for very long and sadly the small range of Orcs quickly became out of production.
The good news is that Ryan and I have now come to an agreement of me buying the rights and moulds from him so that I can put the Orcs back into production relatively soon! The catch however is that all of my funds are tied up in the sculpts I have commissioned so far for my upcoming range.
That's why I am launching this Indiegogo campaign in order to help me buy the Orcs and I could really use all the help I can get!!! I hope to gather enough funds to pay for the rights plus moulds, and also for new castings of the Orc miniatures. Maybe if we do really well I can even ask Paul to expand the Orc range with a couple of new sculpts!
What We Need & What You Get!
I really need your help to at least reach our main goal. If we reach that I can buy the rights to the Orcs from Ryan/Fictive Miniatures as well as the existing moulds and get new castings made.
In the event of us going over our main goal I will try and get Paul Muller to do some more Orc sculpts! A shaman? or some archers maybe?! Paul is a very busy man however so that could still take a while.  
In return you get some great looking and characterful miniatures of some of the best Orc miniatures ever made! You can get just the Orc Lord or a pack of Orc Warriors or if you want more of them you can go for the larger deals which have even better value!
In case this campaign doesn't reach its funding goal then it doesn't mean you won't get your miniatures! Because they are already made and I love them so much I will get them no matter what! It would only mean it will take a bit longer as I will have to scrounge up more money to send to Ryan. He has already told me he is not in much of a hurry so I can take my time.

<p><i>The third battle of Kharkov was the last successful major offensive of the German Army on the Eastern Front.<br/>
<br/>
Encouraged by their success at Stalingrad, the Red Army launched a major offensive threatening the German-held towns of Kursk, Kharkov &amp; Belgorod. In defiance of Hitler’s 'No retreat'-order SS-Gen. Paul Hausser withdrew his forces from Kharkov, keeping them safe for an immediate counter-attack. Under the overall command of von Manstein the most battle hardened elements of the German Army - including the 1., 2. &amp; 3. SS-Panzergrenadiere-Division and the Wehrmacht’s elite ‘Division Grossdeutschland’ - struck back against the over-extended Red Army. After three weeks of brutal fighting in thick snow Charkow was recaptured. </i></p>
<p><i>The Germans lost nearly 50% of their fighting strength (5,000 men &amp; dozens of tanks) but decimated 52 Red Army divisions inflicting nearly 80,000 casualties.</i></p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b>Heer46</b> is a German company that focuses on 1:100 scale tabletop-miniatures. Founded in 2011, it offers a wide range of vehicles and add-on equipment. Take a look at our webshop <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.heer46shop.de/39202120/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.heer46shop.de</a></span></p>
<p>We now want to extend the Heer46-portfolio into 1:56 scale and our first project will be German elite infantry.</p>
<p>In the beginning our new line will focus on the Third Battle of Kharkov, which was fought during the winter of 1943.</p>
<p>Particular mention merits the so-called ‘Charkow-Parka’ that was worn by the ‘Waffen-SS’ and the ‘Division Grossdeutschland’ during the battle. Of course the miniatures are also fitting for all other battles fought on the Eastern Front until 1945.</p>
<p>Our line comprises the most important core-units. I.e. Infantry/Panzergrenadiere and the respective support-weapons, like MG 42, Mortar and PaK 40. The new line is also complemented by 1:56 scale Sd.Kfz. 251 and Panzer III from Rubicon. We will also release extra decal-sheets for the Sd.Kfz. 251 and Panzer III that are based on original photos.</p>
<p>The decals will allow you to recreate the leading vehicle Sd.Kfz. 251 ‘Emil’ and the Panzer III with the number ‘555’. Both vehicles were in use with the LSAH during the Battle of Kharkov.</p>

In the beginning our new line will focus on the Third Battle of Kharkov, which was fought during the winter of 1943.
Particular mention merits the so-called ‘Charkow-Parka’ that was worn by the ‘Waffen-SS’ and the ‘Division Grossdeutschland’ during the battle. Of course the miniatures are also fitting for all other battles fought on the Eastern Front until 1945.
Our line comprises the most important core-units. I.e. Infantry/Panzergrenadiere and the respective support-weapons, like MG 42, Mortar and PaK 40. The new line is also complemented by 1:56 scale Sd.Kfz. 251 and Panzer III from Rubicon. We will also release extra decal-sheets for the Sd.Kfz. 251 and Panzer III that are based on original photos.
The decals will allow you to recreate the leading vehicle Sd.Kfz. 251 ‘Emil’ and the Panzer III with the number ‘555’. Both vehicles were in use with the LSAH during the Battle of Kharkov.
PERKS - What you get?
From the beginning on you will be able to choose from the following core-units:
Here you can see some examples of the miniatures:Here you can see a comparative with other brands:In addition we will offer the following perks: 
1:56 scale Sd.Kfz. 251 and Panzer III from Rubicon

Teams depended on the expected load. The light horse-drawn sleigh could carry up to 300kg and the heavy horse-drawn sleigh (2 or more horses) even up to 1.000kg which was the equivalent of one 5-cm-PaK 38 (986 kg) or 10 wounded soldiers with all their equipment.

<p><strong>RATS!</strong> is a satiric role playing game chronicling the rats’ awakening and subsequent holy war against modern humanity, other animals, each other and numerous inanimate objects as well. Players take on the role of intelligent rats who participate in various insanely dangerous, or just plain insane, missions to further the rodent cause.<br/><br/>Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Our world holds more mysteries and horrors than any man, or even rat, can imagine (without reading the book).<br/><br/>Publishing a game about revolting rats has been my dream and obsession for many years now. During my work on RATS! I’ve come across two wonderfully talented artists who felt inspired by the campaign setting and started creating stunning art for the future book, as well as contributing their own ratty ideas.<br/><br/>We have put a tremendous amount of hard work into this game. With your help, we hope to make this furry vision a reality!</p>

<p>You guys proved to be so amazingly awesome that we reached our funding goal in less than three weeks. Now it's time to expend and solidify the rat empire.</p>
<p><em>Viva la ratvolution!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>$2,800: Short Adventure Collection ACHIEVED!!!<br/></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul><p>RATS! is a strange new game which might be a little confusing for new players on account of the Mutations and Mutilations system, the cooperative pack play mechanics, and the moral ambiguity inherent to playing talking rats trying to take over the world.</p>
<p>To answer these issues, we will produce a collection of short adventures written and illustrated by a plethora of industry veterans and artists. These adventures would work both as one evening’s entertainment and as sidetrack adventures in longer campaigns.</p>
<p>This collection will include 20 adventures and will be about 80 pages long with gritty black and white illustrations by Stav Levi, Yan Clayman, Hugo Solis and others.</p>
<p><em>The adventure anthology will be available in electronic form for FREE to anyone who pre-ordered the hardcopy and for only 5$ to anyone who pre-ordered the electronic copy (no additional shipment fees are required).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>$3,400: RATS! Coffee Table Book <strong>ACHIEVED!!!</strong><br/></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul><p>Many of RATS! most enthusiastic supporters found us through their love of rats and other animals rather than their love of gaming. To honor these excellent comrades, we will create an ART OF RATS! album featuring the best art from the game, as well as original art unique to the album. In addition to the art, the book will include rat facts and rat anecdotes to amuse and terrify readers... but mostly it will be about great art.</p>
<p>The album will be around 160 pages long and will only be available in hardcopy. We’re sort of old fashioned around here when it comes to art books and coffee tables. We like them to be real.</p>
<p><em>The album will be available for $25.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>$4,500: RATS! Fiction Anthology<strong> <strong>ACHIEVED!!!</strong></strong></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul><p>These stories will explore the world of RATS! through the eyes of the many different rat cultures and other awakened animals, such as the melancholic ravens of London, the ever-vigilant dogs of Moscow or that really angry dragon lady whose eggs we ate by accident... We might even feature a story from a human’s perspective, but we’ll let someone really stupid write it. Except for that loser who will write the human story, all other stories will be commissioned from professional writers who will receive pro payment for their contribution.</p>
<p>The anthology will be at least 300 pages long and feature the work of some well-known and scandalous writers, whose names will remain secret for now, and of cheeky new voices from all over the world.</p>
<p><em>The anthology will be available <strong>for FREE</strong> to anyone who contributed $15 or more to the campaign.</em></p>

<h3>$7,000 Mutations and Mutilations Card Deck<em><br/></em>
</h3>
</li>
</ul><p>At this amazing level, we will design several themed mutations and mutilations decks to hand to your players as you maim and twist their beloved PCs beyond recognition. While based on the RATS! MNM system, these cards will be universal in flavor and include a free conversion booklet to adapt them to the d20. Visit our blog for more information on the mutations and mutilations mechanic. Each card will contain a full color theme illustration by a RATS! artist, one mutation, and one mutilation.<br/><br/><em>More information coming soon.</em></p>

<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/9168/47341479.gif"" src="""" style=""""/>A Brief Message From Our Associates</h2>
<p>Run away, little human! The rats just woke up from the long sleep of ignorance, and they want their world back.</p>
<p>You see, as it turns out, God’s chosen people are actually us rats, not you. However, envious of our chosenness, you stole our wisdom and reduced us to witless animals unaware of our rich history, culture and religion. We’ve been like that for thousands of years. All this while, humanity has been in the divine spotlight, convincing itself that it was the chosen species.<br/><br/><strong>Not anymore.</strong><br/><br/>Several years ago, the great rat prophet Ee-Ee stumbled upon an ancient rat scroll in the Judean Desert and his eyes were opened to the truth. He dedicated the rest of his life to traveling across the globe and awakening the rest of his benighted brothers. Wherever he preached, a different culture arose – the Middle Eastern Holy Rat College, the Central European Unirat Collective, the North American Capirat Corporation, the East Asian Nezumi... Thirteen fierce cultures to challenge humanity’s false dominance of the Earth and restore ratkind to its former glory.<br/><br/>Only... mankind just doesn’t seem to notice this grand crusade for justice. Whatever the rats do is attributed to something else – bad weather, terrorism, Canada, some other kind of genocidal, talking rodents...<br/><br/>And if this great historic injustice wasn’t enough, there’s also the Dreaming. For some reason, all rats share the same horribly lucid dream in which their quest failed utterly and just about anything is dedicated exclusively to killing, maiming and doing all kinds of other naughty unpleasantness to rats. This is the Dreaming. It’s like the internet, only it’s free and utterly horrible (like the internet). No wonder rats are so pepped up all the time – the Dreaming might be a great way to securely exchange information, maybe it’s even a parallel world, but by Ee-Ee, it is hell!<br/><br/>The bottom line is that war is an expensive business, even more so if it’s a holy, great, patriotic, inevitable and honorable war. You need propaganda posters, cheese, lots and lots of cheese, weapons, surveillance equipment, some more cheese, WMDs, Swiss cheese... Right! Listen up, you lazy potato rodent. I really don’t have to explain anything to you! Financing a holy war is a privilege, not a burden, so pay up!<br/><br/><strong>A note to human readers:</strong> For all our shortcomings, we are the chosen people of God the Rat, and we will inherit the Earth, space, the Dreaming, the cosmos and all the other places too. Contributing to this project is the only way you can save your life. Thank you for your cooperation, you tasty, tasty human!</p>

<h2>A Rotten System <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/5135/24160889.gif"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h2>
<p>RATS! uses streamlined mechanics based on third edition d20. This system allows the rapid creation and decimation of rat characters. Starting characters can be created within minutes. A good thing, since if you’re not very careful, this will be your lifespan.<br/><br/>There are thirteen diverse cultures, three elite cultures, six races, twenty starting habitats, and a gazillion feats, skills and mutations (inspired by a hundred years of misunderstanding radiation) to customize characters. Thus, while characters are very simple to create and play, they are highly diverse.<br/><br/>There are no classes or levels. Rat characters advance by gaining new abilities and mutations, which are bought directly with XP, and by growing in size. A sufficiently experienced character is a right proper ratzilla. There are no hit points, either. Every time your character is hit, a consequence is rolled. These range from the embarrassing (you make an undignified sound) to the horrifying (you blow up like a watermelon in a Gallagher show).</p>
<p>Players can take on the roles of heroic rats on a grand quest to make the world a rattier place, or manage packs for many litters, placing the good of the collective before their your own (yeah right!).</p>
<p>Rats can also be used as antagonists in a human-starring horror or science fiction campaign, but that's a really mean and unfair thing to do.</p>
<p>Oh, and we don’t have a GMs, storytellers, referees, narrators and all that rubbish. Around these parts, we call the furry fellar running the show BC, the Big Cheese. It is absolutely forbidden to bribe him to get any unfair advantages in the game. On unrelated news, to your right is a list of prices you can pay to get special favors from him.</p>

<p><strong>Blame your Dreams:</strong> An exploration of the nature and rules of most terrible place in the universe – the Dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>Blame the Laws of Physics:</strong> This chapter deals with the actual mechanics through which actions are resolved in RATS! Rats should have at least a vague idea of how the game works, or they risk making utterly inadequate decisions and becoming martyrs earlier than he planned.</p>
<p><strong>Blame your Education:</strong> Skills, Feats and Eccentricities. Be all you can be, read the damn list!</p>
<p><strong>Blame Technology:</strong> Equipment, weapons, armor... stuff. Additionally, you will find rules to help you determine what happens when a rat uses oversized human equipment and improvised rat equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Blame your Enemies:</strong> A list of creatures and NPCs who stand in the way of rats to world domination, tasty morsels, or killing them. These range from extras, like human security guards, to iconic NPCs, such as the mysterious Exterminator.</p>
<p><strong>Blame your Fate:</strong> Tips and ideas for rat campaigns and adventures. These are divided into heroic games and pack games (see pack play above)</p>
<p><strong>Blame your Ignorance:</strong> books, movies, songs and graphic novels that can be used for inspiration. That is, that you can plagiarize to make your games cooler.</p>
<p><strong>Blame the System:</strong> All the tables and boring statistical data concentrated in one place for quick reference.</p>
<p><strong>Go To Bed Defeated:</strong> A short story about rats to get you in the mood. Also, it’s a reward for reading this book instead of eating it.</p>

<h2><strong>Where Does the Money Go?<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/104/82812871.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h2>
<p>The money is going to be spent on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unholy alliance of Indiegogo, PayPal and the global banking system will take about 7% of whatever we raise. We can only imagine with fear where this money will go.</li>
<li>The bulk of our income will go toward producing the book, which includes art, additional text, editing, and layout.</li>
<li>Next in order of initiative is marketing, printing, and shipping; made affordable through the magic of POD and social media.</li>
<li>Leftover money will be placed in waterproof plastic containers and sent into the sewers... I mean, it will be used to “finance” future “products” in the RATS! line (see below).</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, 5% of all income from RATS! will be donated to organizations that promote animal shelters and advocate animal rights.</p>
<h2><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/6449/24893520.gif"" src="""" style=""""/>Project Schedule</strong></h2>
<p>This is how we hope the project will go after we finish fundraising. These dates are not set in stone. Putty would be a more appropriate allegory.</p>
<ul>
<li>February: Finish writing and drawing.</li>
<li>July: Finish editing and layout.</li>
<li>August: Send the PDF core rulebooks to customers.</li>
<li>October: Send the hardcover core rulebooks and other perks to customers.</li>
<li>December: Flood the stores and take over the market.</li>
</ul><p>Other products, such as culture expansions, setting sourcebooks, rulebooks for other awakened species, adventures and campaign arcs, mutation booklets, and possibly even miniatures, are also in the plans. Presently we cannot offer even an approximate schedule for these.<br/><br/>The RATS! core rulebook will be published as a full color 400 page book available in both high quality print on demand and electronic formats.</p>

</h2>
<p>A number of people contacted us lately and asked if they could print the rat flyer and hang it in their local gaming store and/ or club. First of all – of course! Not only do we allow this, we actually bloody well encourage this!<br/> <br/>Secondly, we’re making a special offer to anyone who does this: send us a photo of yourself with the flyer on the wall and we’ll post it on the RATS!

   ************** $5,500 MINI STRETCH GOAL! **************
IN HONOR of the last day of RATS! we're offering a special mini stretch goal - paper minis. If we reach $5,500 by Halloween, everyone who contributed ANY amount will get a free PDF with printable paper minis tied with the adventure collection. These will include rats, people, items and some nasty surprises... And cheese. Of course, there will be cheese! As always, spreading the word is most welcome.

""Crazy shit, I love this!""— Mark Rein·Hagen , creator of Vampire: The Masquerade
 
RATS! is a satiric role playing game chronicling the rats’ awakening and subsequent holy war against modern humanity, other animals, each other and numerous inanimate objects as well. Players take on the role of intelligent rats who participate in various insanely dangerous, or just plain insane, missions to further the rodent cause.Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Our world holds more mysteries and horrors than any man, or even rat, can imagine (without reading the book).Publishing a game about revolting rats has been my dream and obsession for many years now. During my work on RATS! I’ve come across two wonderfully talented artists who felt inspired by the campaign setting and started creating stunning art for the future book, as well as contributing their own ratty ideas.We have put a tremendous amount of hard work into this game. With your help, we hope to make this furry vision a reality!
Make sure to subscribe to our design blog for more cool art, stand-alone game materials, additional rewards and stretch goals.

Stretch Goals 

You guys proved to be so amazingly awesome that we reached our funding goal in less than three weeks. Now it's time to expend and solidify the rat empire.
Viva la ratvolution!


$2,800: Short Adventure Collection ACHIEVED!!!

RATS! is a strange new game which might be a little confusing for new players on account of the Mutations and Mutilations system, the cooperative pack play mechanics, and the moral ambiguity inherent to playing talking rats trying to take over the world.
To answer these issues, we will produce a collection of short adventures written and illustrated by a plethora of industry veterans and artists. These adventures would work both as one evening’s entertainment and as sidetrack adventures in longer campaigns.
This collection will include 20 adventures and will be about 80 pages long with gritty black and white illustrations by Stav Levi, Yan Clayman, Hugo Solis and others.
The adventure anthology will be available in electronic form for FREE to anyone who pre-ordered the hardcopy and for only 5$ to anyone who pre-ordered the electronic copy (no additional shipment fees are required).


$3,400: RATS! Coffee Table Book ACHIEVED!!!

Many of RATS! most enthusiastic supporters found us through their love of rats and other animals rather than their love of gaming. To honor these excellent comrades, we will create an ART OF RATS! album featuring the best art from the game, as well as original art unique to the album. In addition to the art, the book will include rat facts and rat anecdotes to amuse and terrify readers... but mostly it will be about great art.
The album will be around 160 pages long and will only be available in hardcopy. We’re sort of old fashioned around here when it comes to art books and coffee tables. We like them to be real.
The album will be available for $25.


$4,500: RATS! Fiction Anthology ACHIEVED!!!

These stories will explore the world of RATS! through the eyes of the many different rat cultures and other awakened animals, such as the melancholic ravens of London, the ever-vigilant dogs of Moscow or that really angry dragon lady whose eggs we ate by accident... We might even feature a story from a human’s perspective, but we’ll let someone really stupid write it. Except for that loser who will write the human story, all other stories will be commissioned from professional writers who will receive pro payment for their contribution.
The anthology will be at least 300 pages long and feature the work of some well-known and scandalous writers, whose names will remain secret for now, and of cheeky new voices from all over the world.
The anthology will be available for FREE to anyone who contributed $15 or more to the campaign.



$7,000 Mutations and Mutilations Card Deck


At this amazing level, we will design several themed mutations and mutilations decks to hand to your players as you maim and twist their beloved PCs beyond recognition. While based on the RATS! MNM system, these cards will be universal in flavor and include a free conversion booklet to adapt them to the d20. Visit our blog for more information on the mutations and mutilations mechanic. Each card will contain a full color theme illustration by a RATS! artist, one mutation, and one mutilation.More information coming soon.


A Brief Message From Our Associates
Run away, little human! The rats just woke up from the long sleep of ignorance, and they want their world back.
You see, as it turns out, God’s chosen people are actually us rats, not you. However, envious of our chosenness, you stole our wisdom and reduced us to witless animals unaware of our rich history, culture and religion. We’ve been like that for thousands of years. All this while, humanity has been in the divine spotlight, convincing itself that it was the chosen species.Not anymore.Several years ago, the great rat prophet Ee-Ee stumbled upon an ancient rat scroll in the Judean Desert and his eyes were opened to the truth. He dedicated the rest of his life to traveling across the globe and awakening the rest of his benighted brothers. Wherever he preached, a different culture arose – the Middle Eastern Holy Rat College, the Central European Unirat Collective, the North American Capirat Corporation, the East Asian Nezumi... Thirteen fierce cultures to challenge humanity’s false dominance of the Earth and restore ratkind to its former glory.Only... mankind just doesn’t seem to notice this grand crusade for justice. Whatever the rats do is attributed to something else – bad weather, terrorism, Canada, some other kind of genocidal, talking rodents...And if this great historic injustice wasn’t enough, there’s also the Dreaming. For some reason, all rats share the same horribly lucid dream in which their quest failed utterly and just about anything is dedicated exclusively to killing, maiming and doing all kinds of other naughty unpleasantness to rats. This is the Dreaming. It’s like the internet, only it’s free and utterly horrible (like the internet). No wonder rats are so pepped up all the time – the Dreaming might be a great way to securely exchange information, maybe it’s even a parallel world, but by Ee-Ee, it is hell!The bottom line is that war is an expensive business, even more so if it’s a holy, great, patriotic, inevitable and honorable war. You need propaganda posters, cheese, lots and lots of cheese, weapons, surveillance equipment, some more cheese, WMDs, Swiss cheese... Right! Listen up, you lazy potato rodent. I really don’t have to explain anything to you! Financing a holy war is a privilege, not a burden, so pay up!A note to human readers: For all our shortcomings, we are the chosen people of God the Rat, and we will inherit the Earth, space, the Dreaming, the cosmos and all the other places too. Contributing to this project is the only way you can save your life. Thank you for your cooperation, you tasty, tasty human!

A Rotten System 

RATS! uses streamlined mechanics based on third edition d20. This system allows the rapid creation and decimation of rat characters. Starting characters can be created within minutes. A good thing, since if you’re not very careful, this will be your lifespan.There are thirteen diverse cultures, three elite cultures, six races, twenty starting habitats, and a gazillion feats, skills and mutations (inspired by a hundred years of misunderstanding radiation) to customize characters. Thus, while characters are very simple to create and play, they are highly diverse.There are no classes or levels. Rat characters advance by gaining new abilities and mutations, which are bought directly with XP, and by growing in size. A sufficiently experienced character is a right proper ratzilla. There are no hit points, either. Every time your character is hit, a consequence is rolled. These range from the embarrassing (you make an undignified sound) to the horrifying (you blow up like a watermelon in a Gallagher show).
Players can take on the roles of heroic rats on a grand quest to make the world a rattier place, or manage packs for many litters, placing the good of the collective before their your own (yeah right!).
Rats can also be used as antagonists in a human-starring horror or science fiction campaign, but that's a really mean and unfair thing to do.
Oh, and we don’t have a GMs, storytellers, referees, narrators and all that rubbish. Around these parts, we call the furry fellar running the show BC, the Big Cheese. It is absolutely forbidden to bribe him to get any unfair advantages in the game. On unrelated news, to your right is a list of prices you can pay to get special favors from him.

Table of Contents
Below is a tentetive list of the chapters that will be included in the core rulebook.
Wake Up to Fail: A short introduction to the game for the newly awakened rat.
Blame your Parents: This chapter will teach you how to create and maintain rat characters. More importantly, it will teach you how to make them awesome.
Blame the World: A hard stern look at a world created through the oppression of rats and lesser rodents. It contains information on the rats’ tragic history, locations of note, proper and improper theology and ideology, and other awakened animals and humans.
Blame Society: Rats are divided into many cultures and races, and live in a variety of habitats ranging form heaps of delicious garbage to commandeered space stations. Here you will find them described in an objective and honest way.
Blame your Dreams: An exploration of the nature and rules of most terrible place in the universe – the Dreaming.
Blame the Laws of Physics: This chapter deals with the actual mechanics through which actions are resolved in RATS! Rats should have at least a vague idea of how the game works, or they risk making utterly inadequate decisions and becoming martyrs earlier than he planned.
Blame your Education: Skills, Feats and Eccentricities. Be all you can be, read the damn list!
Blame Technology: Equipment, weapons, armor... stuff. Additionally, you will find rules to help you determine what happens when a rat uses oversized human equipment and improvised rat equipment.
Blame your Enemies: A list of creatures and NPCs who stand in the way of rats to world domination, tasty morsels, or killing them. These range from extras, like human security guards, to iconic NPCs, such as the mysterious Exterminator.
Blame your Fate: Tips and ideas for rat campaigns and adventures. These are divided into heroic games and pack games (see pack play above)
Blame your Ignorance: books, movies, songs and graphic novels that can be used for inspiration. That is, that you can plagiarize to make your games cooler.
Blame the System: All the tables and boring statistical data concentrated in one place for quick reference.
Go To Bed Defeated: A short story about rats to get you in the mood. Also, it’s a reward for reading this book instead of eating it.

Where Does the Money Go?
The money is going to be spent on the following:

The unholy alliance of Indiegogo, PayPal and the global banking system will take about 7% of whatever we raise. We can only imagine with fear where this money will go.
The bulk of our income will go toward producing the book, which includes art, additional text, editing, and layout.
Next in order of initiative is marketing, printing, and shipping; made affordable through the magic of POD and social media.
Leftover money will be placed in waterproof plastic containers and sent into the sewers... I mean, it will be used to “finance” future “products” in the RATS! line (see below).
Additionally, 5% of all income from RATS! will be donated to organizations that promote animal shelters and advocate animal rights.
Project Schedule
This is how we hope the project will go after we finish fundraising. These dates are not set in stone. Putty would be a more appropriate allegory.

February: Finish writing and drawing.
July: Finish editing and layout.
August: Send the PDF core rulebooks to customers.
October: Send the hardcover core rulebooks and other perks to customers.
December: Flood the stores and take over the market.
Other products, such as culture expansions, setting sourcebooks, rulebooks for other awakened species, adventures and campaign arcs, mutation booklets, and possibly even miniatures, are also in the plans. Presently we cannot offer even an approximate schedule for these.The RATS! core rulebook will be published as a full color 400 page book available in both high quality print on demand and electronic formats.

Notes on the perks: Shipment (of books, not people) is included starting from the Scariest of Rats.


* Presently, ""published products"" include the below items. This list will expend as more stretch goals are achieved:

Rulebook
Introduction Adventure
Twenty Adventures Collection
Mutations and Mutilations Expansion
BC Screen
Poster Map
Coffee Table Book
 Fiction anthology
Card Deck (provided we reach this stretch goal)
All PDFs published in 2013
Special Offer 

A number of people contacted us lately and asked if they could print the rat flyer and hang it in their local gaming store and/ or club. First of all – of course! Not only do we allow this, we actually bloody well encourage this! Secondly, we’re making a special offer to anyone who does this: send us a photo of yourself with the flyer on the wall and we’ll post it on the RATS! IGG and FB, to let the rats know you should be spared when the time comes. This photo will earn you a first look at the quick start booklet once it becomes available. If the photo is especially awesome you might find yourself referenced in the rulebook or one of the expansions... Now, if you go the extra mile and print a stack of at least 50 flyers (we recommend A5 size) and place them on the store counter or other similar space (with the store owner’s permission, of course) you will be included in the official beta-test group and get a hardcopy of the formal “friend of rats” certificate shipped to your address. Forward comrades, to victory and freedom!

And here is a little something in honor of the elections. Feel free to use it on your site or blog.

""WriteOn!"" is a turn based, social gaming app, that delivers hours of fun and creativity in a colorful and stylish app.  
Unlike any other social gaming app (that allowes only two friends/users to play together), ""WriteOn!"" gives you the ability to play with up to four friends at a time. 
The great fun with ""WriteOn!"", is that anyone can be an author, no skills required. Think for yourselves, wouldn't it be fun to create and share new stories with your friends?
 

""WriteOn!"" is not only a fun and addictive game for kids that adults love, it's also an easy platform for creating new and shared content.
The rules of the game are simple, write a sentence and send it to your friends. Let them complete it, seeing only your last 3 words. After 4 rounds, all the sentences will be revealed,  you'll be able to see the full story and post it on your facebook wall.

created <b>Dino the Beast</b>  we made about <b>200</b> small and larger apps for
<b>Android</b> and about <b>50</b> for <b>iOS</b>. We specialize in music apps (you can find them in the store, for example: our <b>Best Electric Guitar</b>, Best Metronome, Best Piano
Lessons, <b>Best Electronic Drums</b> and more), but we have also made tool apps,
games for kids and small games. </p>
<p>We have made so many applications and finally we have
decided to start making big games. We have seen that lots of other people like
dinosaurs (like we do!)…</p>
<p>…that’s why we have created <b>Dino the Beast </b> :)</p>

</div></div>","Dino the Beast is a runner type game which is
available on Google Play, App Store, Windows Phone and Windows Store. Our users like this game
very much so we have decided to develop a mobile version and prepare Dino for a PC. To do this we need your support!It’s about cute little Dino. Scarred as a child, Dino seeks vengeance. He wants to hunt down the
cruel tyrannosaur who killed his mother.
Dino The Beast consists of the five stages of Dino’s
life. In the first the dinosaur is small and helpless, forced to flee from the
T-Rex from the jungle. With each stage Dino gains additional skills and powers
that will help him deal with his foe! When he grows up, he will be strong
enough to defeat the monster. Until then, Dino will have to overcome many other
dinosaurs that stand in his way in VS mode.
To win and become the king of the jungle you have to complete all the levels, collect
food, complete missions, gain achievments and develop Dino’s capabilities.In Dino’s Cave you can watch as the character grows,
view his collection of trophies and also his extra powers: Slow Motion, Double
Jump and Tough Skin.                                                  DESKTOP VERSION – a special
version prepared for Steam with modified VS mode, HD graphics, longer gameplay
and RPG elements. We have registered Dino on Steam Greenlight. You can find it here. 
Steam users have suggested that we develop Dino for PC - so we’d like to do this with your
help!                                                    
Additional LEVELS with new OBSTACLES
to extend the gameplay (you have the
opportunity of choosing your own obstacle – check Perk:  Baryonx Donor)    
                                                     
Develop DINO’S CAVE –  you change how Dino looks, decorate his cave and even play with the dinosaur (you have the opportunity of choosing your
own decoration – check Perk: Allosaurus Donor).
                                                   

Create new LANDS – we want to add new lands to discover (you have the opportunity of choosing your own land -
check Perk: Amargasaurus Donor)   
                                                       

Add new ENEMIES 
(you have the
opportunity of choosing your own enemy – check Perk: Iguanodon
Donor).
                                                   

Add new MISSIONS and ACHIEVEMENTS

(you have the
opportunity of choosing your own mission and achievement – check Perk: Iguanodon
Donor). 
                                                

Add RPG ELEMENTS 
(new powers, clothes which will change Dino’s skills). You have the opportunity of choosing your own mission and achievement
– check Perks: Dilophosaurus Donor and Monoclonius
Donor. 
                                                 

Add GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES
and APPLE GAME CENTER – to make gameplay more interesting and competitive :)

We have ideas and propositions for new lands, enemies,
missions, achievements, clothes and obstacles for Dino. But we would like to
make this game the best we can, so we are open to your suggestions. Buying
our perks you can decide (!) what things to add to the game. Check it if you
would like to co-create Dino the Beast. We’d like to make it for YOU!                                          Please write and tell us what else you would like to have
in our new version of the game. We are very interested to hear your opinion as to how we can
develop this game.

We are a group of co-workers from Netigen, a company who are passionate about dinosaurs (!) and games. We have been working together for about two years in a team of nine in Cracow, Poland. Before we
created Dino the Beast  we made about 200 small and larger apps for
Android and about 50 for iOS. We specialize in music apps (you can find them in the store, for example: our Best Electric Guitar, Best Metronome, Best Piano
Lessons, Best Electronic Drums and more), but we have also made tool apps,
games for kids and small games. 
We have made so many applications and finally we have
decided to start making big games. We have seen that lots of other people like
dinosaurs (like we do!)…
…that’s why we have created Dino the Beast  :)
Lots of our lovely users write to us and ask about the new
version of Dino. Now we would like to ask you to make it TOGETHER!
We will be very grateful for every dollar which you would like to give us for Dino the Beast. But there are a lot of other things which you can do to help us.                              So what you can do for us?

Write to us and tell us what you think about Dino the Beast!
Tell your friends about Dino the Beast and this campaign!

Follow us on Twitter, Facebook and other social media!

Share information about Dino on your page!

                                


You will have noticed that we don't need a lot of money to make improvements. We have already been working with our Dino for 8 months and we have managed to do a lot. But now we need your support! Why? Because we want our Super Dino to become a Super Mega Dino. If we can do that  you will have even more fun and be fully able to enjoy the Dino The Beast!
1. Three weeks of
our work for five persons. Cost: $4000.
Kasia &
Basia – will create a concept, draw and test:

 increase the resolution of graphics


create and draw objects, clothes, enemies and lands

create new missions and achievements
test new version of the game.

Olo,
Sparrow & Ozi – will program and test: 

additional levels
special game codes
equip Dino with new clothes
enlarge Dino’s Cave
add Google Play Services and Apple Game Center
create three additional lands and five new obstacles
prepare game for the desktop version with special VS mode.
test new version of the game.

2.  IndieGoGo
and Payment Processing Fees. Cost: $545.
In
addition to personnel costs IndieGoGo fee, to work we need equipment,
high-speed computers, software, an illuminated and heated office, furniture, accounting, internet,
table soccer and many other necessary thing. But we have already managed to
earn quite a bit for it! However, we still need just some money from you  to work from
morning to evening and create for you Dino The Beast - The New Features Pack! If we manage to save any money, we will spend the surplus on the new clothes, objects, enemies, powers (like Super Dash) and levels for the game!                             



IndieGoGo will deliver the first
dollop of cash as soon as we meet our first funding goal of $4,545. So that
means the sooner we reach that goal, the sooner we can get started on Dino The
Beast - The New Features Megapack, and the sooner we can show you progress, and the
sooner you can play on the newest version of Dino The Beast! 
So if you intend to contribute,
do not hesitate, do not wait, be as fast and furious as Dino and do
so!

I just couldn't bare to see anyone left outside so I had to do whatever I could to get everyone in! Very expensive decision but hey I think it worked out pretty well! Now let's all pool our money together and chip in so Julian has lunch money for next week. Cause right now it looks like I might have to stick to ramen and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our total bill came to 8k. Yes 8k. Now to put that on perspective. That's 8000 whopper juniors on the dollar menu. That's also a small car. It could probably also feed hundreds of kids for a year. But we decided to spend it on pouring champagne down people's throats. Yes. First world problems indeed. </p>
<p>Now. I would love to do it again with you guys and it would really help if I could recoup a good chunk of that. Doesn't have to be all of that but a good chunk would be sweet. That way we can still all be friends. </p>
<p>So. Please dig deep guys and girls. Send this to everyone that was at our table last night. Please pitch in the most you possibly can. Every 1000 dollars helps. A homeless guy raised 100k I think we can out together 7! </p>
<p>So thank you guys for forwarding this to your friends. So that Julian can feel good about himself and justify going out and doing this in the future. Otherwise he is going to crawl up in a ball and stare at this receipt thinking how stupid he was for months to come. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I love you all very much. I have a table at bijou tomorrow and at the day party. You are all obviously welcome. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Send this to everyone to chip in. Even your mothers. Your fathers. Your sisters or your grandmothers. </p>

But we decided to spend it on pouring champagne down people's throats. Yes. First world problems indeed. 
Now. I would love to do it again with you guys and it would really help if I could recoup a good chunk of that. Doesn't have to be all of that but a good chunk would be sweet. That way we can still all be friends. 
So. Please dig deep guys and girls. Send this to everyone that was at our table last night. Please pitch in the most you possibly can. Every 1000 dollars helps. A homeless guy raised 100k I think we can out together 7! 
So thank you guys for forwarding this to your friends. So that Julian can feel good about himself and justify going out and doing this in the future. Otherwise he is going to crawl up in a ball and stare at this receipt thinking how stupid he was for months to come. 

I love you all very much. I have a table at bijou tomorrow and at the day party. You are all obviously welcome. 

Send this to everyone to chip in. Even your mothers. Your fathers. Your sisters or your grandmothers.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Ihmiskunta on asuttanut muita aurinkokuntia ja eksoplaneettoja noin 50 valovuoden säteellä Maasta valoa nopeamman matkailun mahdollistaneen Oberman-moottorin avulla. Suurin osa siirtokunnista on edelleen pieniä yhdyskuntia, jotka elävät luonnonvaroja keräämällä ja jalostamalla. Vain pieni osa siirtokunnista on itsenäisiä ja omavaraisia.</span></p><p>Valtaosaa siirtokunnista hallitsee <i>Federaatio</i>, eli <i>Maan Kansakuntien Federaatio</i>, joka edustaa Maan valtioita ja hallinnoi avaruuden asuttamista. Federaation valta on kuitenkin vain nimellistä, sillä todellinen valta on massiivisilla, kaikkialla läsnäolevilla <i>hyperkorporaatioilla</i>, jotka hallitsevat suurinta osaa Maan, sekä sen siirtokuntien luonnonvaroista, taloudesta ja teknologisesta infrastruktuurista.</p><p>Käynnissä on <i>3. Eksosota</i>, eli kolmas Maan ulkopuolinen sota, joka on nyt laajentunut suurimmaksi sodaksi ihmiskunnan historiassa. Ihmiskunta on sodassa <i>kollektiivina</i> tunnetun, äskettäin kohdatun muukalaiskulttuurin kanssa. Vuosia kestänyt sota ja levottomuudet näkyvät kaikkialla paitsi aivan Federaation ytimessä, jossa kansalaiset elävät huoletonta ja ylellistä elämää monien muiden siirtokuntien taistellessa elämälle välttämättömistä perusresursseista, kuten vedestä, ilmasta ja ruuasta.</p><p>Kaikessa hiljaisuudessa hyperkorporaatiot ovat tekemässä jotain peruuttamatonta. Malakim-raunioista löydettiin pitkään horroksessa ollut organismi, joka heräsi peitellyn Thestias-tapauksen yhteydessä. Organismi on vihamielinen parasiitti, jonka ainutlaatuisten ominaisuuksien uskotaan olevan avain ihmiskunnan, tai ainakin joidenkin etuoikeutettujen, nostamiseen ihmisevoluution seuraavalle tasolle.</p><ul></ul><div> </div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464607679/pelimekaniikka_yxvnxn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464106233/reuna-w620_l3ebwl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Sääntöjen ytimenä SOTAKARJUT-roolipeli käyttää helposti opittavaa <a href=""http://ironspine.com/wp/sotakarjut/voimankayton-saannot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pelimekaniikkaa</a>, jossa haastetilanteessa kerätään hahmon Kyvyn ja Taidon arvojen verran 10-tahoisia noppia. kaikki nopat heitetään kerralla ja jokainen noppa, jonka tulos on 6 tai enemmän tuottaa yhden onnistumisen. Mikäli onnistumisia tulee enemmän kuin tehtävän vastus, hahmo onnistuu tavoitteissaan.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/pn2sphr7rb53fyi/SK-2016-hahmolomake-0.3b-01.png?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_310/v1465292766/SK-2016-hahmolomake-0.3b-01_ue5xzw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Lataa pelitesti hahmolomake <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/pn2sphr7rb53fyi/SK-2016-hahmolomake-0.3b-01.png?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TÄSTÄ</a></p><p> </p><div>

Mitä siis vielä tarvitaan valmiiseen sääntökirjaan?</p><ol>
<li>Ensinnäkin peli vaatii vielä toimitustyötä oikean kirjoitustyylin viimeistelyyn ja oikoluvun.</li>
<li>Lisäksi haluan päivittää suuren osan kuvituksesta vastaamaan paremmin tarkentunutta kuvaa pelin maailmasta ja tunnelmasta. Kuvitus tulisi olemaan tyyliltään sellaista kuin traileri-videossa tai kuvitukset tällä sivulla.</li>
<li>Jotta tämä kaikki saadaan toimimaan yhteen, kirja pitää taittaa.</li>
</ol><p>Vaikein työ on kuitenkin jo takana päin. Pelimaailman yksityiskohtien hiominen ja pelimekaniikka ovat yleensä se aikaa vievin osuus ja ne on tehty. Voisi siis sanoa, että olemme loppusuoralla.</p><h3>Minkälainen valmis kirja sitten olisi?</h3><p>Valmiista sääntökirjasta tulee kolme eri versiota:</p><p><b>Pdf-versio</b>: Pdf-versio on sähköinen versio sääntökirjasta. Pdf-versio jaetaan tarvepainettujen kirjojen tapaan <i>DrivethruRPG </i>ja <i>RPGnow</i> -verkkokauppojen tai Backerkitin kautta. </p><p><b>Pehmeäkantinen</b>: Pehmeäkantinen versio tulee saataville tarvepainatettuna (Print on Demand) kirjana ja se toimitetaan <i>DrivethruRPG</i> tai <i>RPGnow</i> -verkkokauppojen kautta. </p><p><b>Kovakantinen</b>: Kovakantinen kirja kestää käyttöä pehmeäkantista paremmin tukevien kansien, sekä lankasidonnan ansiosta. Kovakantisesta kirjasta on saatavilla perus- ja premium-laadulla. Paperilaatu on molemmissa sama, mutta premium-laatuisessa kirjassa värit ovat kylläisempiä ja peittävämpiä. Kaikki Luutnantti (60+) tai sitä arvokkaammat tuotepaketit sisältävät premium-laatuisen kovakantisen kirjan.</p><p> </p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Painetun kirjan strategiset mitat</b></p><ul>

 SOTAKARJUT on sotilas-scifin ja psykologisen jännityksen elementtejä yhdistelevä pöytäroolipeli, joka sijoittuu noin kolmesataa vuotta tulevaisuuteen. Ihmiskunta on sodan kourissa ja samalla suuren murroksen äärellä. Yllättäen tapahtumien keskipisteessä ovat sotakarjut, sotaa varten valmistetut kloonit, joita myös pelaajien hahmot ovat. Tyylillisesti lähelle osuvia vertailukohtia voisivat olla esimerkiksi uusi Battlestar Galactica -tv-sarja sekä Aliens, Avatar ja Starship Troopers -elokuvat.    SOTAKARJUT-roolipelin tapahtumat alkavat vuodesta 2310. Ihmiskunta on asuttanut muita aurinkokuntia ja eksoplaneettoja noin 50 valovuoden säteellä Maasta valoa nopeamman matkailun mahdollistaneen Oberman-moottorin avulla. Suurin osa siirtokunnista on edelleen pieniä yhdyskuntia, jotka elävät luonnonvaroja keräämällä ja jalostamalla. Vain pieni osa siirtokunnista on itsenäisiä ja omavaraisia.Valtaosaa siirtokunnista hallitsee Federaatio, eli Maan Kansakuntien Federaatio, joka edustaa Maan valtioita ja hallinnoi avaruuden asuttamista. Federaation valta on kuitenkin vain nimellistä, sillä todellinen valta on massiivisilla, kaikkialla läsnäolevilla hyperkorporaatioilla, jotka hallitsevat suurinta osaa Maan, sekä sen siirtokuntien luonnonvaroista, taloudesta ja teknologisesta infrastruktuurista.Käynnissä on 3. Eksosota, eli kolmas Maan ulkopuolinen sota, joka on nyt laajentunut suurimmaksi sodaksi ihmiskunnan historiassa. Ihmiskunta on sodassa kollektiivina tunnetun, äskettäin kohdatun muukalaiskulttuurin kanssa. Vuosia kestänyt sota ja levottomuudet näkyvät kaikkialla paitsi aivan Federaation ytimessä, jossa kansalaiset elävät huoletonta ja ylellistä elämää monien muiden siirtokuntien taistellessa elämälle välttämättömistä perusresursseista, kuten vedestä, ilmasta ja ruuasta.Kaikessa hiljaisuudessa hyperkorporaatiot ovat tekemässä jotain peruuttamatonta. Malakim-raunioista löydettiin pitkään horroksessa ollut organismi, joka heräsi peitellyn Thestias-tapauksen yhteydessä. Organismi on vihamielinen parasiitti, jonka ainutlaatuisten ominaisuuksien uskotaan olevan avain ihmiskunnan, tai ainakin joidenkin etuoikeutettujen, nostamiseen ihmisevoluution seuraavalle tasolle.   Sääntöjen ytimenä SOTAKARJUT-roolipeli käyttää helposti opittavaa pelimekaniikkaa, jossa haastetilanteessa kerätään hahmon Kyvyn ja Taidon arvojen verran 10-tahoisia noppia. kaikki nopat heitetään kerralla ja jokainen noppa, jonka tulos on 6 tai enemmän tuottaa yhden onnistumisen. Mikäli onnistumisia tulee enemmän kuin tehtävän vastus, hahmo onnistuu tavoitteissaan.Lataa pelitesti hahmolomake TÄSTÄ 

 
Esittelyversio on saatavilla myös DrivethruRPGn kautta: LATAA TÄÄLTÄ.
     Malli valmiista kirjasta (ei varsinainen tuote) Tilanne nytSOTAKARJUT on tällä hetkellä 160-sivuinen raakataitettu pelitestikirja ilman kuvituksia. Mitä siis vielä tarvitaan valmiiseen sääntökirjaan?
Ensinnäkin peli vaatii vielä toimitustyötä oikean kirjoitustyylin viimeistelyyn ja oikoluvun.
Lisäksi haluan päivittää suuren osan kuvituksesta vastaamaan paremmin tarkentunutta kuvaa pelin maailmasta ja tunnelmasta. Kuvitus tulisi olemaan tyyliltään sellaista kuin traileri-videossa tai kuvitukset tällä sivulla.
Jotta tämä kaikki saadaan toimimaan yhteen, kirja pitää taittaa.
Vaikein työ on kuitenkin jo takana päin. Pelimaailman yksityiskohtien hiominen ja pelimekaniikka ovat yleensä se aikaa vievin osuus ja ne on tehty. Voisi siis sanoa, että olemme loppusuoralla.Minkälainen valmis kirja sitten olisi?Valmiista sääntökirjasta tulee kolme eri versiota:Pdf-versio: Pdf-versio on sähköinen versio sääntökirjasta. Pdf-versio jaetaan tarvepainettujen kirjojen tapaan DrivethruRPG ja RPGnow -verkkokauppojen tai Backerkitin kautta. Pehmeäkantinen: Pehmeäkantinen versio tulee saataville tarvepainatettuna (Print on Demand) kirjana ja se toimitetaan DrivethruRPG tai RPGnow -verkkokauppojen kautta. Kovakantinen: Kovakantinen kirja kestää käyttöä pehmeäkantista paremmin tukevien kansien, sekä lankasidonnan ansiosta. Kovakantisesta kirjasta on saatavilla perus- ja premium-laadulla. Paperilaatu on molemmissa sama, mutta premium-laatuisessa kirjassa värit ovat kylläisempiä ja peittävämpiä. Kaikki Luutnantti (60+) tai sitä arvokkaammat tuotepaketit sisältävät premium-laatuisen kovakantisen kirjan. Painetun kirjan strategiset mitat

     Tavoittelimme alunperin vähintään  2000€ edestä ennakkomyyntiä kuvituksen ja muiden tuotantokulujen kattamiseksi. Ennakkomyynti 2000€ ylittävältä osalta sijoitetaan pelin tuotantoarvojen parantamiseen – esimerkiksi värikuvituksen, offset-painatuksen, erikoisnoppien sekä lisäsivujen muodossa.  Tavoitteen perusteet ja kulurakenneTavoittelemamme summat perustuvat 10 vuoden kokemukseen roolipelin julkaisussa ja saamiimme tarjouksiin esimerkiksi kirjapainoilta ja kuvittajilta sekä projektin muihin toteutuneisiin ja ennakoituihin kuluihin.Lähtökohtaisesti tavoite ei ole rahoittaa koko tuotantoa ennakkomyynnillä vaan omakin panos laitetaan mukaan. Ennakkomyynti sijoitetaan kokonaan kirjan välttämättömiin tuotantokuluihin.Projektin kulurakenne on suunnilleen seuraavanlainen:*

45% – Painokulut ja muut suorat tuotantokulut 

30% – Kuvitus, taitto ja muu grafiikka

n. 10% – Indiegogo, Backerkit ja Paypal palkkiot

10% – Arvonlisävero (kirjasta, oheistuotteista alv 24%)

n. 5% – Muut oheiskulut (esim. ohjelmistot)
* Projektin eri osa-alueiden keskinäinen suhde muihin kuluihin riippuu mm. lopullisesta sivumäärästä, painotekniikasta, paperilaadusta ja siitä tuleeko kuvitus mustavalkoisena vai värillisenä. Jatkotavoitteet  LAATUPÄIVITYS: 10€ tai arvokkaampi tuotepakettiTämä jatkotavoite tulee muuttamaan pelin ilmeen kertaheitolla, kun kaikki pelin sisäkuvitus tehdään värillisenä.Seuraavat jatkotavoitteet jäivät saavuttamatta: 
4000€ - Tyyppioperaatio
5000€ - Sivumäärä +20
6000€ - Offset-erikoispainos
7000€ - Avaruuskartta kirjojen mukaan
8000€ - Sivumäärä +40
9000€ - Tekninen Manuaali -lisäosa
10000€ - Sivumäärä +60
12000€ - Erikoisnopat
14000€ - Kyborgit & Kimeerit -lisäosa

<p>As a thank you to those who contributed to either of my previous
Egyptian Harem Indiegogo campaigns I am throwing in a free bonus figure of an
Egyptianised goblin minion sculpted by Kev Adams.  The Egyptian goblin
holds a statuette of the god Set and is armed with a dagger.<span>  He was originally conceived as an evil minion
for the Egyptian sorceress.  Kev had
suggested the figure in one of our many discussions about the range – Kev is a
prolific miniatures sculptor and has been working in the industry since the
1980’s – and is most famously known as the ‘Goblin Master’ for his work on
various fantasy ranges.  Last year while
working in his home on the Egyptian range he was brutally attacked and stabbed
by three burglars.  Kev has since
recovered from his injuries and has returned to making miniatures with a
vengeance.  This miniature is just a
small token of appreciation from Kev and myself for your interest and support
of the Egyptian Harem range.  <b>For those of you who missed my first two
Indiegogo campaigns, or those of you who would like additional copies of the
Egyptian goblin, just add $4 per figure to your perk total and notify me in the
comment box of your paypal payment.</b></span></p>

Whether you are a collector or gamer you are certain to enjoy these figures!  Check out the gallery for more images!Most of the miniatures on offer in this campaign have already been sculpted so the majority of your contributions will be going to cover production costs of moulding and casting.  Funding will also make it possible to commission more miniatures and expand the range.  The figures offered in this Indiegogo campaign will eventually be sold under the label of Dark Fable Miniatures and I hope to have a website up and running within the year.This is an excellent opportunity to acquire these fantastic miniatures at an early stage in the development of the range and at a reasonable price.  A number of perks are on offer from $20 to $300 making it possible for anyone with an interest in these miniatures to make a contribution.  There are also a number of really cool stretch goal rewards which makes your contribution even more of a bargain.  I am also offering the option of add-ons at a flat rate of $12 a set to level 3 contributors or higher, which allows you to tailor your order to your own gaming needs.At this stage in the game this is very much a no-frills operation and everyone will receive their sets of miniatures in small zip-lock bags with plastic slotta bases.  (Sorry - no blister packs yet!).  Postage world-wide is included as part of the perk, but if you require special delivery or signed for that will be at your own cost.  Contact me regarding rates. When can I expect to get my miniatures?  You should get your miniatures within a few weeks of the campaign ending, if not sooner.  I have already made good progress in getting the first 10 sets of miniatures moulded and cast.  If there are any delays I will be sure to let you know exactly what is going on and how long it might take.  I have already run two successful Indiegogo campaigns and made sure that my contributors received their miniatures in a timely fashion.
1. Eunuch Harem Guards II: Pole-axes2. Eunuch Harem Guards III: Chief eunuch variant and two spearmen3. Eunuch Harem Guards IV: Senior eunuch and two spearmen4. Court Personalities: Body Guard, Physician, Scribe5. Egyptian Queen and Attendants6. Giant Egyptian Cobras7. Serving Girls8. Foreign Slave Girls9. Egyptian Sorceress and Attendants10. Royal Guardsmen with Spears (shields must be attached)11. Royal Guardsmen with Axes (shields must be attached)12. Royal Guardsmen with Khopesh Swordss (shields must be attached)

As a thank you to those who contributed to either of my previous
Egyptian Harem Indiegogo campaigns I am throwing in a free bonus figure of an
Egyptianised goblin minion sculpted by Kev Adams.  The Egyptian goblin
holds a statuette of the god Set and is armed with a dagger.  He was originally conceived as an evil minion
for the Egyptian sorceress.  Kev had
suggested the figure in one of our many discussions about the range – Kev is a
prolific miniatures sculptor and has been working in the industry since the
1980’s – and is most famously known as the ‘Goblin Master’ for his work on
various fantasy ranges.  Last year while
working in his home on the Egyptian range he was brutally attacked and stabbed
by three burglars.  Kev has since
recovered from his injuries and has returned to making miniatures with a
vengeance.  This miniature is just a
small token of appreciation from Kev and myself for your interest and support
of the Egyptian Harem range.  For those of you who missed my first two
Indiegogo campaigns, or those of you who would like additional copies of the
Egyptian goblin, just add $4 per figure to your perk total and notify me in the
comment box of your paypal payment.
